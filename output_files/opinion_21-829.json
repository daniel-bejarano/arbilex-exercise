Counsel for Defendant Thomas Jefferson \nUniversity Hospital, Inc. \nMarch)o , 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Blanche A. Brown appears pro se. She commenced this lawsuit on \nJune 7, 2021. (D.I. 1 ). The thirty-three page Amended Complaint is the operative \npleading. (D.I. 4). It names four defendants : the United States, \"Thomas Jefferson \nUniversity Hospital,\" \"Thomas Jefferson Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery,\" and Dr. G. Joel \nFunari. Plaintiff asserts jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.1 Before the Court \nare motions to dismiss filed by Defendants G. Joel Funari, DMD and Thomas Jefferson \nUniversity Hospital, Inc. (D.I. 8, 33). The matters have been fully briefed. \nI. BACKGROUND \nI take the factual allegations of the Amended Complaint as true and construe \nthem in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff is a 100% disabled veteran and \nbeneficiary of Veterans Administration benefits. Her disability is due to a cardiac \ncondition. \nDefendant Dr. Funari is an oral surgeon who practices at Defendant Thomas \nJefferson Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery and is affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University \nHospital. (D.I. 4. at~ 4). During the relevant time frame, Dr. Funari provided services \nat the Wilmington VA Clinic as an independent contractor subject to VA guidelines and \nat the direction of the Wilmington VA Clinic Dental Department Head. (Id. at~ 4; D.I. 9-\n1 at~ 4). Thomas Jefferson University Hospital is a training partner of the VA's \nGraduate Medical Education training program. (D.I. 4 at~ 4). \n1 Moving Defendants seek dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3). The Amended Complaint, however, asserts jurisdiction \nby reason of a federal question, not by reason of diversity of the parties. \n1 In July 2019, Plaintiff consulted with an endodontist about alternatives to tooth \nextraction. She sought treatment for the dental condition at the Wilmington VA Medical \nCenter. (D.I. 4 ,m 4, 13, 14). She brought up the subject with an unnamed VA dentist \nat a routine appointment in August 2019 \nPlaintiff relayed that the endodontist recommended a surgical extraction and had \ninformed Plaintiff that it was not a simple procedure . (Id. at 1115). Plaintiff requested a \npre-operative meeting with an oral surgeon to discuss the recommendation . (Id. at 11 \n16). Plaintiff expressed her preference that a licensed oral surgeon, not a trainee, \nperform the procedure . (Id. at 1118). A dental assistant at the VA Clinic-Brenda\u00ad\nstated she had no choice about who performed the procedure. (Id.). \nOn August 23, 2019, Plaintiff presented at the VA Clinic for a consultative \nappointment and saw Dr. Funari, a licensed oral surgeon. (Id. at 11 19). During the \nappointment , Dr. Funari advised her that he and a trainee were prepared to perform the \nroutine extraction. (Id. at 1111 19, 20). Plaintiff thought the appointment was a \nconsultation only, and, because she believed the tooth extraction was a complex \nprocedure , she reiterated her preference that a licensed provider and not a trainee \nperform the procedure. (Id. at 1111 19-21 ). Dr. Funari did not conduct even a cursory \nexamination and he mischaracterized the procedure as routine. (Id. at 11 20). \nDr. Funari's notes in Plaintiff's chart refer to Plaintiff's demand for an overnight \nhospitalization for the procedure because of a bleeding problem due to leukopenia and \na complicated medical history. (Id. at 1123). The notes state that there was no \nmedical indication to admit Plaintiff to the hospital for a routine extraction. (Id.). Dr. \nFunari instructed Plaintiff to contact her primary medical care team at Lebanon VA \n2 Medical Center who then made a referral to her cardiologist. (Id. at ,i 25). A \nWilmington VA Medical Center dentist saw no problem with Dr. Funari's notes. (Id.). \nPlaintiffs emergency dental issue was not addressed even after she was medically \ncleared, and, two years later, in June 2021 , it remains untreated. (Id.). \nThe Amended Complaint contains seventeen counts. The captions of a count \nare not always consistent with the body of the count. And it is not always clear which \nDefendants are supposed to be a defendant in each count. The Court takes a broad \nreading of what Plaintiff claims: Count 1, unlawful discrimination, in violation of Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; Section 1557 of the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18116, the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1346(b), and the United States Constitution ; (2) Count 2, violation of the Thirteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution ; (3) Count 3, violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution ; (4) Count 4, retaliation for Plaintiff \nexpressing preferences related to the dental extraction in violation of the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; (5) Count 5, negligence and gross \nnegligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act and Delaware law; (6) Count 6, \ndiscrimination for failure to accommodate Plaintiffs disabilities in violation of the \nRehabilitation Act and the Affordable Care Act; (7) Count 7, discrimination in federal \nprograms and retaliation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act and the Affordable Care \nAct; (8) Count 8, privacy violations under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, HIPAA, and invasion of \nprivacy under Delaware law; (9) Count 9, negligence per se in violation of federal \nstatutes, regulations and policies under the Federal Tort Claims Act; (10) Count 10, \nnegligent entrustment in violation of the Federal Tort Claims Act and Delaware law; (11) \n3 Count 11, negligent breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in \nviolation of the Federal Tort Claims Act and Delaware law; (12) Count 12, tortious \ninterference with, and breach of, contract in violation of Delaware law; (13) Count 13, \nnegligent misrepresentation in violation of the Federal Tort Claims Act and Delaware \nlaw; (14) Count 14, breach of fiduciary duty in violation of the Federal Tort Claims Act \nand Delaware law; (15) Count 15, negligent training of a VA Clinic dental assistant \nBrenda; (16) Count 16, negligent infliction of emotional distress in violation of the \nFederal Tort Claims Act and Delaware law; and (17) Count 17, intentional infliction of \nemotional distress and willful misconduct and grave indifference in violation of the \nFederal Tort Claims Act and Delaware law. \nPlaintiff seeks costs, compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages and \ninjunctive, mandamus, and declaratory relief. \nDr. Funari moves for dismissal pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). \nThomas Jefferson University Hospital moves for dismissal pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), \n12(b)(2), 12(b)(6), and 12(h)(3). Despite the wide-ranging allegations in the Amended \nComplaint, it appears that the only facts alleged against the two moving Defendants \ninvolve Dr. Funari's interactions with Plaintiff on August 23, 2019, including making \nnotes in her medical file. \nPlaintiff opposes the motions to dismiss. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Rule 12(b)(1) \nRule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits the dismissal of an \naction for lack of subject matter jurisdiction . A Rule 12(b)(1) motion may be treated as \n4 either a facial or factual challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction . See Davis \nv. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 346 (3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack contests the \nsufficiency of the pleadings , whereas a factual attack contests the sufficiency of \njurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 105 (3d \nCir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the court accepts the plaintiff's well\u00ad\npleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences from those \nallegations in the plaintiff's favor. See In re Horizon Healthcare Services Inc. Data \nBreach Litigation , 846 F.3d 625, 633 (3d Cir. 2017). When reviewing a factual attack, \nthe court may weigh and consider evidence outside the pleadings . See Gould Elecs. \nInc. v. United States, 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000). \nB. Rule 12(b)(2) \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the Court may \ndismiss a suit for lack of jurisdiction over the person. Although Rule 8 does not require \na plaintiff to set forth in the complaint \"the grounds upon which the court has personal \njurisdiction over the defendant ,\" Hansen v. Neumueller GmbH, 163 F.R.D. 471,474 (D. \nDel. 1995), \"once a defendant has raised a jurisdictional defense, a plaintiff bears the \nburden of proving by affidavits or other competent evidence that jurisdiction is proper.\" \nDayhoff Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co., 86 F.3d 1287, 1302 (3d Cir. 1996). If the district court \ndoes not hold an evidentiary hearing, the court should resolve any factual disputes in \nthe plaintiff's favor and should deny the motion if the plaintiff's evidence establishes \"a \nprima facie case of personal jurisdiction. \" Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAl/iance \nPharma SA, 623 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir. 2010). \n5 Two requirements , one statutory and one constitutional, must be satisfied for \npersonal jurisdiction to exist over a defendant. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. C & C \nHelicopter Sales, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 400, 403 (D. Del. 2002). \"First, a federal district \ncourt may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state in which the court \nsits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.\" Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)). \nThe Court must, therefore , determine whether there is a statutory basis for jurisdiction \nunder the Delaware long-arm statute. Id. (citing 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c)). \"Second, \nbecause the exercise of jurisdiction must also comport with the Due Process Clause of \nthe United States Constitution , the Court must determine if an exercise of jurisdiction \nviolates [Defendant's] constitutional right to due process.\" Id. (citing International Shoe \nCo. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310 (1945)). \n\"Once a jurisdictional defense has been raised, the plaintiff bears the burden of \nestablishing with reasonable particularity that sufficient minimum contacts have \noccurred between the defendant and the forum state to support jurisdiction .\" Id. \n(citing Provident Nat'/ Bank v. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 819 F.2d 434,437 (3d \nCir. 1987). Plaintiff may establish jurisdictional facts through sworn affidavits or other \ncompetent evidence . See Time Share Vacation Club v. Atlantic Resorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d \n61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984). \nPlaintiff must demonstrate either specific or general jurisdiction. Specific \njurisdiction arises when the particular cause of action arose from Defendant's activities \nwithin the forum state. In contrast, general jurisdiction does not require Defendant's \nconnections be related to the particular cause of action, but that Defendants have \ncontinuous or systematic contacts with the forum state. American Bio Medica Corp. v. \n6 Peninsula Drug Analysis Co, Inc., 1999 WL 615175 (D. Del. Aug. 3, 1999). \"[A]t no \npoint may a plaintiff rely on the bare pleadings alone in order to withstand a defendant's \nRule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction. \" Id. Plaintiff is \nrequired to respond to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \nwith actual proof, not mere allegations . Id. See also Hurley v. Cancun Playa Oasis \nln'tl Hotels, 1999 WL 718556, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 1999) (stating that \"[g]eneral \naverments in an unverified complaint or response without the support of sworn affidavits \nor other competent evidence are insufficient to establish jurisdictional facts.\" \nC. Rule 12(b)(6) \nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds \npro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her complaint , \"however inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \nlawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94. A court may consider the pleadings , public \nrecord, orders, exhibits attached to the complaint , and documents incorporated into the \ncomplaint by reference. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makar Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 \n(2007). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the \ncomplainant, a court concludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of \nentitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations ' are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply provide 'labels and conclusions ' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of \n7 a cause of action.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). I am \"not required to credit bald assertions or \nlegal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint. \" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., \nInc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198,216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, \nhowever, \"for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\" \nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \"substantive \nplausibility .\" Id. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the \n[complainant] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. at 679. \nIn deciding motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts generally \nconsider only the allegations in the complaint , exhibits attached to the \ncomplaint , matters of public record, and documents that form the basis of \na claim. A document forms the basis of a claim if the document is \n\"integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint. \" The purpose of this \nrule is to avoid the situation where a plaintiff with a legally deficient claim \nthat is based on a particular document can avoid dismissal of that claim by \nfailing to attach the relied upon document. Further, considering such a \ndocument is not unfair to a plaintiff because, by relying on the document, \nthe plaintiff is on notice that the document will be considered . \nLum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted); \nsee also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. \n1997). \n8 D. Rule 12(h)(3) \n\"If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction , the \ncourt must dismiss the action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). \"A federal court may sua \nsponte dismiss a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) when the allegations within the complaint 'are so \nattenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit, ... wholly \ninsubstantial , ... obviously frivolous, ... plainly unsubstantial, ... or no longer open to \ndiscussion. \"' DeGrazia v. F.B.I., 316 F. App'x 172, 173 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Hagans \nv. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 536-37 (1974)). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nA. Personal Jurisdiction \nThomas Jefferson University Hospital seeks dismissal for lack of personal \njurisdiction on the grounds that the care at issue took place in Delaware, there are no \nallegations that the care took place at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in \nPennsylvania or that it has any office or facility in Delaware. It also argues that the \nAmended Complaint merely alleges that Dr. Funari has an affiliation with Thomas \nJefferson University Hospital and, because Dr. Funari provided Plaintiff care in \nDelaware, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital should be subject to this Court's \njurisdiction. Thomas Jefferson also argues that the Complaint fails to allege that it has \nhad such extensive , regular, and systemic contacts with Delaware so that it has \npurposefully availed itself to this forum. \nIn response , and in an attempt to prove that Thomas Jefferson University \nHospital has extensive , regular, and systemic contacts with Delaware, Plaintiff provided \n9 a six-page fill-in-the-blanks form: \"Dental Education Affiliation Agreement between \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) as the Sponsoring Institution, and a School of \nDentistry and its Affiliate Institutions .\" (D.I. 36-7 at 1-6). The document , however, is a \nblank form. It is not executed by Thomas Jefferson University Hospital or by anyone \nelse. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to prove jurisdiction is \nproper as to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Therefore , the motion to dismiss \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction will be granted. Assuming arguendo that there is \npersonal jurisdiction , as discussed below, the Amended Complaint fails to state federal \nclaims upon which relief can be granted. \nB. Federal Tort Claims Act \nCounts 1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 17 raise claims under the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. The United States is the only proper defendant in a case brought under \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act. See CNA v. United States, 535 F.3d 132, 138 n.2 (3d Cir. \n2008). It recently appeared and filed a motion to dismiss. (D.I. 37). \nC. Rehabilitation Act and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nCounts 1, 6, and 7 raise disability discrimination , failure to accommodate a \ndisability, and retaliation claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the Affordable Care \nAct. Moving Defendants seek dismissal on the grounds that the Counts fail to state \nclaims upon which relief can be granted. \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits programs that receive federal \nfunds from discriminating against an individual based on disability, as follows: \"No \notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by \nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the \n10 benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any \nExecutive agency.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act provides that \"an individual shall not, on the ground prohibited \nunder ... section 794 of Title 29, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any \npart of which is receiving Federal financial assistance , including credits, subsidies , or \ncontracts of insurance, or under any program or activity that is administered by an \nExecutive Agency or any entity established under this title (or amendments) . The \nenforcement mechanisms provided for ... section 7942. . . shall apply for purposes of \nviolations of this subsection .\" See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18116. \"For disability-discrimination \nclaims, the [Affordable Care Act] incorporates the substantive analytical framework of \nthe [Rehabilitation Act].\" Francois v. Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Inc., 8 F.4th 370, \n378 (5th Cir. 2021) (citing Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., Inc., 926 F.3d 235, \n239 (6th Cir. 2019)). Therefore, the Court analyzes the Rehabilitation Act claims and \nAffordable Care Act claims together. \nTo state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must establish that \"[1] he \nis a qualified individual with a disability, [2] who was precluded from participating in a \nprogram, service, or activity, or otherwise was subject to discrimination, [3] by reason of \n2 Exhaustion of administrative remedies before suing on a Section 504 claim is not \nrequired when a plaintiff does not sue a federal agency for employment discrimination \nand claims do not \"have the effect of circumventing some other Congressionally \nmandated exhaustion requirement. \" Freed v. Consol. Rail Corp., 201 F.3d 188, 192 \n(3d Cir. 2000). \n11 his disability .\" Furgess v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., 933 F.3d 285, 288-89 (3d Cir. \n2019); see also Chambers v. School Dist. of Phi/a. Bd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176,189 (3d \nCir. 2009). Employees of federally funded entities are not subject to individual liability \nunder the Rehabilitation Act. See Emerson v. Thiel Coll., 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. \n2002) (\"Because the individual defendants do not receive federal aid, Emerson does not \nstate a claim against them under the Rehabilitation Act.\"). In addition, parties cannot \nbe held liable in their individual capacities under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See A. \nW v. Jersey City Public Schools, 486 F.3d 791, 804 (3d Cir. 2007) (\"Suits may be \nbrought pursuant to [the Rehabilitation Act] against recipients of federal assistance , but \nnot against individuals. \"); accord Doe v. DeJoy, 2020 WL 4382010 , at *11 (E.D. Pa. July \n31, 2020) (holding that there is no individual liability under the Rehabilitation Act and \nciting authority) . \nPlaintiff's disability discrimination claims fails. As alleged, Plaintiff was not \nprecluded from participating in any program, service, or activity, or otherwise was \nsubject to discrimination by reason of a disability. Rather, medical recommendations \nwere made based upon Plaintiff's medical and dental condition, Plaintiff's requests for \nthe procedure to take place in a certain manner were denied, and Plaintiff was \ndissatisfied with the denial. There are no allegations that the dental procedure was \ndenied based upon Plaintiff's disability. Therefore , Count 1 will be dismissed. \nPlaintiff alleges a failure to accommodate when she was refused her request for \nan inpatient hospitalization for extraction of her tooth. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct imposes a duty on federally funded programs to make reasonable accommodations, \nalthough not \"fundamental or substantial \" ones, when necessary to assure \"meaningful \n12 access.\" Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985); see Berardelli v. Allied \nServs. Inst. of Rehab. Med., 900 F.3d 104,114,115 (3d Cir. 2018). \nPlaintiff's claim against Dr. Funari fails as a matter of law as there is no \nindividual liability under the Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. It also fails as to \nThomas Jefferson University Hospital given that there are no allegations of an \nemployer-employee relationship between Dr. Funari and Thomas Jefferson University \nHospital or that the hospitalization Plaintiff requested would take place at Thomas \nJefferson University Hospital. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants at Wilmington \nVA Medical Center and Dr. Funari who is either \"affiliated with\" (see 0.1. 4 at 3) or \"of \nThomas Jefferson University Hospital\" (see id. at 24) refused to accommodate her \nrequest for a post-surgical overnight stay the medical center's hospital ward (i.e., the VA \nMedical Center), not at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. See Sharrow v. Bailey, \n910 F. Supp. 187, 195 (M.D. Pa. 1995) (allegations sufficient to state a Section 504 \nRehabilitation claim by alleging co-defendant physician was hospital's employee . \nTherefore , Count 6 will be dismissed . \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants ' refusal to admit her for a tooth extraction and \nnotes in her medical record were made in retaliation for her request that the extraction \nbe performed by a licensed surgeon. To state a claim for retaliation , a Plaintiff must \nshow (1) that she engaged in a protected activity, (2) that defendants ' retaliatory action \nwas sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her rights , \nand (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the \nretaliatory action. Robinson v. Potter, 453 F.3d 990, 994 (3d Cir. 2006). \n13 As previously discussed , there is no individual liability under the Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act and, therefore, Plaintiffs claim against Dr. Funari fails as a matter \nof law. With regard to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital's alleged retaliation , the \nCourt assumes , without deciding, that Plaintiffs expressed preference for a licensed \nsurgeon is protected activity. As just discussed , there are no allegations of an \nemployer/employee relationship between Dr. Funari and Thomas Jefferson University \nHospital and, therefore , Dr. Funari's actions cannot be imputed to Thomas Jefferson \nUniversity Hospital. And regardless , as alleged the procedure was to be performed by \na licensed surgeon. Moreover, Plaintiffs allegations and complaints are similar to the \nnotes Dr. Funari placed in her record and fall far short of retaliatory conduct. Count 7 \nfails to state a retaliation claim and will be dismissed . \nD. Privacy Violations \nIn Count 8, Plaintiff alleges that the Wilmington VA Medical Center failed to \nprotect her patient record and privacy, violated VHA policy 1605, HIPAA, and the \nPrivacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a when it allowed Dr. Funari to improperly access her patient \nfile and enter a defamatory , misleading , harassing and retaliatory treatment note. The \nfederal claims against the two moving Defendants fail for several reasons. \"VHA \nDirective 1605\" \"establishes the responsibility ... for compliance with all applicable \nFederal privacy and confidentiality statutes and regulations .\" (See D.I. 9-2 at 5, 9). It \ndoes not create any legal rights. There is no private right of action to bring a HIPAA \nclaim. See Fatir v. Phelps, 2019 WL 2162720 , at *12 (D. Del. May 17, 2019). The \nPrivacy Act authorizes private civil actions for violations of its provisions only against an \nagency, not against any individual. See Trevillion v. McLachlan , 2009 WL 528698, at \n14 *2 (D. Del. Feb. 27, 2009) (citations omitted). The VHA Policy 1605, HIPAA, and the \nPrivacy Act claims fail as a matter of law and will be dismissed . \nE. Constitutional Violations \nCounts 1, 2, 3, and 4 raise claims for violations of the First, Thirteenth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution . The claims fail. \nCounts 13 and 2 allege violations of the Thirteenth Amendment. Count 1 \nalleges that \"Defendants engaged in well-established and institutionalized systemic ... \nindentured Servitude against Veterans\" with service-connected disability ratings \"by \ntargeting and exploiting (and indenturing) this group of Patients as commodities and a \nreadily available pool of non-consenting and involuntary human subjects.\" (D.I. 4 at 11 \n42). Count 2 alleges that Veterans Health Administration regularly places disabled \nveterans \"into involuntary servitude as un-consenting Human Subjects, Guinea Pigs and \ntraining tools for high-paid MPE consultants, institutions, and their trainees.\" (Id. at 11 \n43). \nThe Thirteenth Amendment prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude . The \nComplaint states that Defendants allegedly use disabled veterans as training tools for \nconsultants, institutions and their trainees is the equivalent of slavery or involuntary \nservitude is patently without merit.4 The Thirteenth Amendment claims in Counts 1 and \n2 will be dismissed . \n3 Count 1 does not specifically recite the Thirteenth Amendment, but the Court infers \nthat the claim is based on that. \n4 While not clear, it may be that Plaintiff is referring to residents or medical students. \n15 Count 3 alleges violations of the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \"deny to any \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" As these words indicate, \nthe provision applies only to \"state actors,\" not private citizens or private, non-\ngovernmental corporations . See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 924, 939 \n(1982). To the extent Plaintiff raises the claims against federal actors, the claim fails. \n\"The Fourteenth Amendment only applies to actions of the states and not to the federal \ngovernment. \" Brown v. Philip Morris, Inc., 250 F.3d 789 (3d Cir. 2001). There are no \nallegations that any defendant is a state actor and, therefore, the claim also fails in that \nregard. The Court will grant the motion to dismiss Count 3. \nCount 4 alleges Defendants violated her right to free speech when, after she was \ntold by a VA clinic technician at some earlier time that she did not have a choice on who \nperformed the dental procedure,5 and Plaintiff verbalized her concerns and preferences \nthat the surgery not be performed by a trainee, Dr. Funari retaliated by entering \n\"disparaging\" notes on her chart. To the extent this claim is raised as a Bivens claim \n(the federal counterpart to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), retaliation is not a recognized Bivens \nclaim. See Bistrian v. Levi, 912 F.3d 79, 96 (3d Cir. 2018); Vanderklok v. United States, \n868 F.3d 189, 198 (3d Cir. 2017) (\"The Supreme Court has never implied a Bivens \naction under any clause of the First Amendment. \"). Therefore , Count 4 will be \ndismissed . \n5 The Amended Complaint refers to \"they told her she does not have a choice\" (0.1. 4 at \n,I 45) but the only factual allegation about someone telling her that was the allegation \nabout the dental assistant (id. at ,I 18). \n16 F. Supplemental Jurisdiction \nBecause the Amended Complaint fails to state federal claims against Dr. Funari \nand Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, the Court exercises its discretion and \ndeclines to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs supplemental state law claims raised \nagainst them in Counts 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. See De Asencio v. \nTyson Foods, Inc., 342 F.3d 301, 309 (3d Cir. 2003); Daniels v. Bank of New York \nMellon, 2017 WL 4541756, *7 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2017), appeal dismissed , 2018 WL \n1968243 (9th Cir. Mar. 15, 2018). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants ' motions to dismiss; \n(2) dismiss all federal claims against Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Dr. \nFunari; and (3) decline to exercise jurisdiction over all supplemental state claims raised \nagainst them. Amendment of the federal claims raised against Thomas Jefferson \nUniversity Hospital and Dr. Funari is futile. \nA separate order shall issue. \n17 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nBLANCHE A.
