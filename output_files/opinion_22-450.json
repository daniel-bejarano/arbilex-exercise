Giuliano, Cross-Appellant and Appellee. \nDecember 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware ~-~~-\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE: \nThis dispute arises from an adversary proceeding filed by former employees Todd Stewart \nand Jennifer Sawle (\"Plaintiffs\"), on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, against \nthe above-captioned debtors asserting claims based upon debtors' failure to provide required notice \nto employees before a March 20, 2020 mass layoff under the Federal Worker Adjustment and \nRetraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq. (the \"WARN Act\"). Chapter 7 trustee Alfred \nT. Giuliano (\"Trustee\") filed a motion for summary judgment asserting three exceptions to the \nWARN Act as defenses: that notice was not required because debtors were \"liquidating \nfiduciaries\" and not \"employers\" under the WARN Act; or, in the alternative , that debtors were \n\"employers\" under the WARN Act, but that notice was not required because an \"unforeseeable \nbusiness circumstance\" caused the mass layoff and/or a \"natural disaster\" caused the mass layoff. \nAs the mass layoff was contemporaneous with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand unprecedented government-ordered shutdowns , the motion for summary judgment required \nthe Bankruptcy Court to apply the WARN Act notice exceptions to unusual facts and \ncircumstances. On March 21, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Order (Adv. D.I. 64, \nA00l 722)1 and accompanying Opinion, In re Art Van Furniture, LLC, 638 B.R. 523 (Bankr.

Before the Court is Plaintiffs ' appeal of those \nholdings, along with the Trustee's cross-appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's determination that the \nfacts of the case did not satisfy the \"liquidating fiduciary\" exception to the WARN Act. For the \nreasons set forth herein, the Court will affirm the Order, in part, and reverse the Order, in part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Events Leading to Chapter 11 \nFounded in 1959, Art Van Furniture, LLC (\"Art Van,\" and, together with Sam Levin Inc. \n(\"SLI\") and certain other affiliates, the \"Debtors\") is a brick-and-mortar furniture and mattress \nretailer headquartered in Warren, Michigan . (A000001 -A000032 (\"Ladd Deel.\") 1 5). Debtors \noperated 169 locations, including 92 furniture and mattress showrooms and 77 freestanding \nmattress and specialty locations throughout Michigan , Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania , \nMaryland , Missouri, and Virginia. Pennsylvania-based companies Levin Furniture and Wolf \nFurniture were acquired by Art Van in November 2017. \nIn the months leading up to the Petition Date, Debtors struggled under the weight of poor \nsales and $208.5 million in secured debt, encumbering substantially all of their assets, consisting \nof: (i) $33.5 million in an asset-backed loan (\"ABL Loan\") from Wells Fargo Bank (\"Wells \nFargo\") and (ii) a $175 million term loan (the \"Term Loan\") from FS KKR Capital Corp (the \n\"Term Lenders\" and together with Wells Fargo, the \"Secured Lenders\"). (Ladd Deel. 117-8, 13-\n14, 16-18, 31-36). On February 5, 2020, Debtors defaulted on the ABL Loan, and were only able \nto obtain a forbearance from Wells Fargo through February 28, 2020, giving Debtors just 23 days \nto find a buyer, an investor, or a means of recapitalizing the business. As a condition to the \nforbearance , Wells Fargo insisted that the Debtors begin preparing for going-out-of-business store \nclosing (\"GOB\") sales. (Ladd Deel. 1114, 36). Debtors were unable to secure financing or attract \n2 a going concern buyer. On February 28, 2020, the forbearance period ended. (Ladd Deel. ,r 16). \nDebtors negotiated a wind-down budget with Wells Fargo and entered into a consulting agreement \nwith HilcoMerchant Resources, LLC (\"Liquidator \") (A001084-A001123) (\"Consulting \nAgreement \"). (Ladd Deel. ,r,r 16-18). \nParallel with these efforts, Debtors continued to pursue alternative transactions, and in the \ndays leading up to the Petition Date, reached an agreement-in-principle with Robert Levin, the \nformer owner of Levin Furniture , regarding a going-concern sale of certain of the assets of SLI \nand LF Trucking, Inc. (\"Levin Sale\"). (Ladd Deel. ,r 19). On March 4, 2020, Debtors entered into \na letter agreement, which contemplated that the Levin Sale would: provide for cash and non-cash \nconsideration, including the assumption of liabilities related to customer deposits, employee \nobligations, specified cure costs, and potential claims under\u00a7 503(b)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code; \npreserve nearly 1,000 jobs; and provide for the continued operation of approximately 44 retail \nstore locations under the Wolf and Levin store banners and two related distribution centers. (Ladd \nDeel. ,r 19). The letter agreement thus contemplated continued operations of the Levin Sale stores \npending approval of the sale by the Bankruptcy Court in order to preserve the value of those stores \nfor the buyer. (Id.) The Levin Sale was expected to be consummated in early April 2020. (Ladd \nDeel. at ,r 18). Because Debtors had no money to operate these stores, the purchaser agreed to \nextend $10 million of debtor-in-possession (\"DIP\") financing to Debtor SLI (Bankr. D.I. 137 \n(\"Levin DIP\"). \nOn March 5, 2020, Debtors publicly announced that they were going out of business. The \nsame day, Debtors issued a WARN Act notice to approximately 1,400 potentially \"affected \nemployees\" who worked in or reported to seven facilities in Michigan, two facilities in Illinois and \none in Pennsylvania. Each of the Plaintiffs who worked at an affected location in Michigan were \nnotified as follows: \n3 Art Van Furniture , LLC (the \"Company\") has made the difficult decision to wind\u00ad\ndown its operations , which will include the closure of its facilities located at 6500 \nE 14 Mile Rd, Warren, MI, 48092; 27775 Novi Rd, Novi, MI, 48377; 4375 28th St \nSE, Grand Rapids, MI,49321; 4095 E Court St, Burton, MI, 48509; 14055 Hall Rd, \nShelby Township , MI, 48315; 8748 W Saginaw Hwy, Lansing, MI, 48917; and \n4273 Alpine Ave Nw Ste B, Alpine, MI, 49321, and will be permanently \nterminating the employment of all employees at these locations. \nThe Company submits this notice to you to satisfy any obligation that may exist \nunder the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2101 et seq. (the \"WARN Act\"). If no obligations exist, this notice is being \nprovided to you voluntaril y. \nAll terminations of employment will be permanent and you will not have bumping \nrights for other positions (i.e., you will not have the right to displace employees \nwith less seniority). While an exact date has not yet been established for these \nclosures, it is anticipated that your employment with the Company will terminate \non May 5, 2020 or a date within 14 days thereafter which may be provided to you \nby the Company (your \"Termination Date\"). Nothing in this letter alters your at\u00ad\nwill employment status with the Company. \nYou will be required to work through your Termination Date, following which date \nyou will not be required to report to work or provide any services to the Company. \n(A000875) (\"GOB Sale WARN Notice\"). \nB. The Chapter 11 Cases \nOn March 8, 2020 (\"Petition Date\"), Debtors filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of \nthe Bankruptc y Code with the intention of winding down their affairs through an orderly \nliquidation to maximize the liquidation value of the estates' assets and the recoveries for the \nDebtors' creditors. The Debtors' plan for an orderly liquidation and wind-down included \nliquidating their inventory through the GOB sales and the Levin Sale, paying down their secured \ndebt, and using any remaining proceeds of their GOB sales to wind-down operations . (Ladd Deel. \n1 2). Debtors' \"first day motions\" sought obtain approval of the wind-down budget, the Levin \nDIP, and the GOB sales, along with assumption of their Consulting Agreement with the Liquidator \n(A000110-A000237). On March 11, 2020, the Bankruptc y Court entered an interim cash collateral \norder, authorizing the Debtors to use cash collateral in accordance with the wind-down budget \n4 until April 7, 2020 ( unless terminated earlier due to default or entry of a final order) to conduct the \nGOB sales (A000238-A000302). The wind-down budget assumed that the GOB sales would \ncontinue unabated through April 30, 2020, and provided that \"the failure by the Debtors to continue \nsales of the Assets in accordance with the Consulting Agreement and to assume the Consulting \nAgreement on a timely basis\" is a default. Debtors therefore continued their ongoing GOB sales. \nShortly after the Petition Date, Debtors assert that their situation changed drastically , as \n\"the restrictions on economic and other activity that various state and local governments \ndetermined to be necessary to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease mandated that the Debtors \ndiscontinue all retail operations and other non-essential business operations.\" (A000304-A000333 \n(\"Conversion Motion\") ,r,r 1-2). The unprecedented and extraordinary adverse effects during this \nperiod (social, economic, and business) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that confronted the \nDebtors and many other businesses are a matter of public record. (See A000435-A001427) \n(\"Sandler Deel.\"), at Exs. L & S (A001206-A001250)).3 As a result, Debtors assert, customer \ntraffic in their stores, which had been robust just days earlier, dissipated drastically in the week \nfollowing the Petition Date. (See Conversion Motion ,r,r 22, 26). Specifically, during the initial \ndays of the GOB sales from March 5-8, 2020, deposits from inventory sales were in excess of $23 \n3 Among other signs of the escalation of the pandemic, on March 13, 2020, the then\u00ad\nPresident declared a national emergency (A001206-A001208); on March 14, 2020, the \ngovernor of Pennsylvania issued guidance urging all non-essential businesses to close \n(A001210); two days later, he amplified the message, declaring: \"The Wolf Administration \nis relying on businesses to act now before the governor or the Secretary of Health finds it \nnecessary to compel closures under the law for the interest of public health ... \" (A001213) ; \non March 16, 2020, the governor of Michigan entered an executive order that closed \nMichigan's bars, theaters, casinos, and other public spaces, and further urged Michigan \nresidents to \"mak[e] smart choices\" by \"not putting [themselves] or others at risk by going \nout in public unless it is absolutely necessary\" (A001216); and on March 19, 2020, \nPennsylvania issued a \"stay at home\" or \"shelter in place\" order (A001220) , with similar \norders soon following in Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which were in lock-down by \nMarch 23, 2020 (A001223-A001251) . \n5 million; however, for the full week ending March 15, 2020, deposits from sales were just $8 \nmillion suggesting, among other things, a precipitous drop in customer traffic in the Debtors' \nstores. (Id. 122). Further, on March 19, 2020, the proposed purchaser for the Levin Sale notified \nthe Debtors that it would not proceed with the transaction. (Id. 1 26). Debtors soon reached a \ndetermination that their plan for liquidation was no longer viable and that a more immediate \nshutdown of the Debtors' stores and remaining support operations was in the estates' and creditors' \nbest interest. (Id. 11 1-2). \nAt a status conference held on March 19, 2022, Debtors' counsel told the Bankruptc y Court \nthat despite \"attempting to operate as much as possible in the ordinary course,\" Debtors had \"t[ old \nemployees not to report to work\" effective that day. (PA00797-PA00826 (\"3/19/20 Tr.\") at 10:9-\n12). Counsel stated that it was the compan y's \"hope\" that the locations it had \"at least temporaril y, \nshuttered\" that day would not be closed \"forever,\" but asserted the need to \"adapt consistent with \nour obligations and fiduciary duties.\" (Id. at 10:12-18). Debtors' counsel stated, \"we are trying \nto explore with our lenders and our other stakeholder s . . . other options short of outright \nliquidation. \" (Id. at 12:9-14). Debtors' counsel specificall y mentioned the possibility of a pause \nin the Chapter 11 liquidation process: \nSo let me just say then, conceptuall y, we are looking at the possibility of.. .going \nidle or going into a state of dormancy for a period of time, and then the possibility \nthen of either ... reopening stores, some subset of stores as, either in furtherance of \nthe going concern transaction ... or ... closing sales and an orderly liquidation , you \nknow, essentially , once the economic and retail environment and the safety \nenvironment have improved to a degree that we can do that. . . . [T]here are a \nnumber of scenarios under consideration.. . we are right now, engaging in a \ndialogue with Wells Fargo and our term loan lenders to see if there's a way to \npursue that alternative. \n(Id. at 12:23-13:13). Debtors' counsel advised that for any alternatives to be possible, Wells Fargo \nneeded to cooperate , as there was a need for: \n6 cooperation from the ABL agent and the term loan lenders and ... assurances that, \nwhile we are having these dialogues ... they'll take no precipitous action to make \nthat --an already difficult situation worse by [] sweeping all of the cash, for \nexample, that are in the debtors' cash collection accounts and leaving us without \neven the cash necessary to fund those operating and restructuring expenses already \nincurred or that might be incurred imminently , as we're [] trying to navigate this \nsituation. \n(Id. at 13:17-14:3) (emphasis added). Wells Fargo's counsel described the unexpected nature of \nthe Debtors' shut-down decision: \"A lot of this information and the debtors' decisions , \nunfortunately, are coming at us minutes before ... these hearings.\" (Id. at 14:9-15:2) . Counsel \nexplained while Wells Fargo wanted \"to try to find a path forward ... that makes sense for all \nstakeholders, \" the Debtors, \"as opposed to other cases,\" had not \"fully come to their creditors, \nother than to say this is somebody else 's problem and, put --you know, fix it for us or don't sweep \nor do these things.\" (Id. at 15:2-11). Counsel continued , \"unfortunately , we haven't gotten the \ninformation that we need from the company to be able to even consider a full wind-down plan. \n(Id. at 15:16-18) . Finally, counsel to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors conveyed its \nhope that \"44 stores would be saved, thousands of jobs would be saved. Maybe that will happen \ndown the road.\" (Id. at 20:18-21). The Committee favored \"put[ting] everything on ice and let's \ncome back to it in[] a month or two and see.\" (Id. at 22:4-9). \nLater that same day, Debtors notified their employees that Debtors were permanentl y \nterminating its non-leader personnel the next day and its lead personnel three days later: \nOn March 5, 2020, Art Van Furniture , LLC (the \"Company\") informed employees \nthat it had made the difficult decision to wind-down its operations, to include the \nclosure of its retail facilities located at [ seven Michigan sites], which would in the \npermanent termination the emplo yment [sic] of all employees at these locations. \nSince initial notice, the Company has been impacted by the novel COVID-19 virus \nand the resulting, and sudden, negative economic impact. Due to these unforeseen \nevents, the Company can no longer support the wind-down of its retail operations \nthrough the originally projected termination date. The Company , therefore, \nsubmits this revised notice to you to satisfy any obligation that may exist under the \n7 federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et \nseq. (the \"WARN Act\"). \nAll terminations of employment will be permanent and you will not have bumping \nrights for other positions (i.e., you will not have the right to displace employees \nwith less seniority). The employment of Art Van's sales associates and other \ncommissioned employees , visuals, housekeepers, drivers, helpers, and other hub \nwarehouse staff, Selling Managers and Outlet Managers as well as any Sales or \nStore Manager who is not scheduled to perform services on March 21, 2020 or \nMarch 22, 2020, will be terminated on March 20, 2020. All CPU's and office staff, \nalong with the Store Manager and/ or Sales Manager scheduled to work on March \n21, 2020 or March 22, 2020 will be terminated at the end of the business day on \nMarch 22, 2020. Nothing in this letter alters your at-will employment status with \nthe Company. You will be required to work through your Termination Date, \nfollowing which date you will not be required to report to work or provide any \nservices to the Company. \n(\"COVID WARN Notice\") (A001252). \nAt a subsequent hearing, on March 31, 2020, Debtors' counsel addressed the mass layoff, \nstating \"we were not able to get to a point where we had the agent support and consent for the \nmothball arrangement primarily because of the company 's liquidity issues and cash needs, both as \nthey exist today based on obligations that have accrued thus far since the filing and the expected \nobligations[.]\" (PA00828-PA00885 (\"3/31/20 Tr.\") at 7:1-6). Wells Fargo's counsel, however, \npainted a different picture. Counsel explained that the Debtors' decision to immediately suspend \noperations, including places where there were no shutdown orders in place, and \"to terminate all\" \nor \"significantly all of their employees \" \"was not something that was done in coordination with \nthe lenders, either the ABL lender or the term lender, or even the [ store-closing] consultant ... who \n... had remained to support the debtor's efforts to try to continue a GOB sale.\" (Id. at 12:23-\n13: 13). Counsel further stated, \"[ s ]o, as a result of terminating their employees, ... the debtors \nnow have significant accrued PTO commissions , other benefits related to the terminated \nemployees as well as healthcare obligations . Most of these were not included in any budget and \ncertainly in the cash collateral budget because there was no contemplation of a wholesale mass \n8 termination of employees.\" (Id. at 13:14-20). Wells Fargo's counsel further indicated these \nobligations might have been avoided had employees been laid off temporarily: \"Could these have \nbeen mitigated if employees had been furloughed [ or by] less drastic more spaced out termination \nwe will never know ... but now these expenses exist.\" (Id. at 13:20-25). \"[J]ust the employee \nobligations alone\" were over $14 million. (Id. at 14:1-4). \nWells Fargo declared a default under the interim cash collateral order, and terminated use \nof cash collateral. (Conversion Motion 1 27). Unable to continue the Chapter 11 cases without \nthe Secured Lenders' consent to use their cash collateral, Debtors filed the Conversion Motion, \nand the Chapter 11 cases were converted to cases under Chapter 7 on April 6, 2020. (A001344-\nA001349). \nC. The Chapter 7 Cases and the Adversary Proceeding \nPlaintiffs Mr. Stewart and Ms. Sawle were two of the Debtors' employees, and each \nworked at one of Debtors' 82 stores in the State of Michigan. Mr. Stewart was a store manager at \na store in Shelby Township, Michigan, and Ms. Sawle was a salesperson at a store in Lansing, \nMichigan. In accordance with the COVID WARN Notice, Mr. Stewart and Ms. Sawle were both \nterminated on March 20, 2022 (the \"Layoff'). (A000335-A000345 (\"Complaint\") at 116, 7, 10). \nOn March 23, 2020, Plaintiffs initiated the adversary proceeding by filing the Complaint which \nseeks judgment for unpaid wages and other benefits and damages for up to 60 days that would \nhave been otherwise paid in accordance with the WARN Act. \nThe Trustee filed an answer on December 10, 2020 (A000346-A000362) (\"Answer \"). In \nthe Answer, the Trustee conceded that Debtors Art Van and SLI-the direct employers of the \nfurniture store employees-were WARN employers. (Answer at 111-2, 45 (A000347, A000356) \n(admitting Plaintiffs were employed by Art Van and were terminated along with other \"employees \nof [ Art Van] and [SLI]'', both of which employed more than 100 employees, and denying only \n9 \"employer\" status of other Debtor entities)). The Answer asserted the WARN employer defenses \nof \"unforeseea ble business circumstances \" and \"natural disaster\" pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2102(b)(2)(A) & (B). (See A000358- A000359 ). \nTen months later, on October 29, 2021, the Trustee filed his First Amended Answer \n(A000369-A000387) (\"Amended Answer\") asserting, for the first time, that Art Van was not, in \nfact, a WARN employer, but rather a WARN-exempt \"liquidating fiduciary.\" (Id. ,r 58). Because \nthe \"unforeseeable business circumstances \" and \"natural disaster\" defenses only apply to \n\"employers,\" Trustee pled those defenses in the alternative. (Id. at ,r,r 60-65). A mere two weeks \nlater, on November 12, 2021, Trustee filed his motion for summary judgment on all three defenses. \n(A000388-A00434) . On December 3, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their brief in opposition and cross\u00ad\nmotion for deferred ruling (A001428-A00165 2) (\"Cross-Motion\"), arguing that Plaintiffs were \ngiven inadequate opportunity to conduct discovery before the filing of the summary judgment \nmotion. \nOn March 21, 2022, the Bankrupt cy Court issued its Opinion and Order granting summary \njudgment in the Trustee's favor on the WARN Act's \"unforeseeable business circumstances \" and \n\"natural disaster\" affirmative defenses. The Bankruptc y Court relied on \"the facts as agreed to by \nthe Plaintiffs and facts arising from orders or transcripts in this bankruptcy case.\" In re Art Van \nFurniture , 638 B.R. at 527-28. \"Because the Court concludes that this combination of undisputed \nfacts and facts in the record provide a sufficient basis for ruling on the Trustee's Summary \nJudgment Motion, the Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to Defer Ruling is denied.\" Id. \nD. The Appeal \nOn April 4, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal from the Order. (Civ. No. 22-450 \n(GBW), D.I. 1). On April 14, 2022, Trustee filed his Notice of Cross-Appeal. (Civ. No. 22-489 \n(GBW), D.I. 1). The appeal is fully briefed. (D.I. 14, 21, 24). By order dated August 23, 2022, the Court granted various parties4 leave to file an amicus brief (D .I. 16-1) in support of Plaintiffs ' \nopening brief, and Trustee has filed his response (D.I. 25). The cross-appeal is fully briefed as \nwell. (D.I. 12, 20, 23). The Court did not hear oral argument because the facts and legal arguments \nare adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be \nsignificantly aided by oral argument. \nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Order granting summary judgment in favor of the Trustee is final, and the Court has \njurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(l). The district court uses an abuse of \ndiscretion standard when reviewing the trial court's decision as to whether a summary judgment \nmotion was ripe for resolution. Doe v. Abington Friends School, 480 F.3d 252,256 (3d Cir. 2007); \nLorenzo v. Griffith, 12 F.3d 23, 27 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2003). In reviewing a bankruptcy court's grant of \nsummary judgment , the district court applies a plenary, or de novo standard of review to legal \ndeterminations. Biase v. Congress Fin. Corp. (In re Tops Appliance City, Inc.), 372 F.3d 510,513 \n(3d Cir. 2004); In re Hechinger , 298 F.3d 219,224 (3d Cir. 2002); Am. Flint Glass Workers Union \nv. Anchor Resolution Corp. , 197 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1999). The reviewing court looks at whether \nthe record demonstrates \"a genuine issue of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Saldana v. Kmart Corp., 260 F.3d 228, 232 (3d Cir. \n2001 ). Courts must view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all \ninferences in that party's favor. Gray v. York Newspapers, Inc., 957 F.2d 1070, 1078 (3d Cir. \n1992). A court should find for the moving party \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \n4 Amici in this case are the Communication Workers of America, the Service Workers \nInternational Union, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of \nState, County and Municipal Employees , and the National Employment Law Project \n( collectively \"Amici\"). \n11 genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter \noflaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,247 (1986). \nIII. ANALYSIS \nCongress passed the WARN Act to ensure that employees received adequate notice before \ntheir employer ordered a mass layoff or plant closing. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(a). As Congress found, \nadvance notice of mass layoffs is critical to protecting workers, their families, and their \ncommunities. It gives workers time to retrain, apply for new jobs, and adjust their financial \ncircumstances before losing their income. It enables state and local governments to help laid off \nemployees find new jobs. And it places workers in the best position possible to protect their \nfamilies' access to food, healthcare , and education. See generally H.R. Rep.

(In re United \nHealthcare System, Inc.), 200 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 1999) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104(a)). \"To \nprove a WARN Act violation, a plaintiff must show that: ( 1) the defendant was 'an employer;' (2) \nthe defendant ordered a 'plant closing' or 'mass layoff;' (3) the defendant failed to give employees \n60-days' notice before the closing or layoff; and (4) the plaintiff is an 'aggrieved ' or 'affected' \nemployee.\" Easom v.

If a plaintiff proves these elements , \"the employer may avoid liability by \nproving as an affirmative defense that it qualifies for one of the Act's exceptions: the 'faltering \ncompany' exception ; the 'unforeseen business circumstances ' exception; or the 'natural disaster' \nexception.\" Id. at 904 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102). \nAs numerous courts have held, \"the WARN Act's exceptions permitting a reduction of the \nnotice period run counter to the Act's remedial purpose and thus, are to be 'narrowly construed .\"' \nEasom v. US Well Servs., Inc., 37 F.4th 238,244 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting Carpenters Dist. Council \nof New Orleans v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 15 F.3d 1275, 1282 (5th Cir. 1994)); see generally \nMarkowitz v. Ne.

Corp. Consol. Litig., 541 F.3d 233,249 (3d Cir. 2008). \nFinally, Congress expressly authorized the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") to prescribe \nregulations carrying out the WARN Act. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107. \"Such regulations shall, at a \nminimum, include interpretative regulations describing the methods by which employers may \nprovide for appropriate service of notice as required by this chapter.\" Id. \nA. The \"Liquidating Fiduciary\" Exception \nTrustee argues on appeal that Art Van was not an \"employer \" under the WARN Act but \nrather a bankrupt entity functioning as a WARN-exempt \"liquidating fiduciary. \" The WARN Act \ndefines an \"employer \" as \"any business enterprise that employs (A) 100 or more employees , \nexcluding part-time employees ; or (B) 100 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least \n4,000 hours per week (exclusive of hours of overtime).\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(a)(l). The term \n\"business enterprise \" is not defined in the statute and not helpful in determining whether Art Van \nwas an \"employer \" required to provide sixty days' notice prior to its termination of employees. \nAs the Third Circuit noted in a similar situation, \"[i]t is appropriate , therefore , to consider agency \n13 regulations and comments as well as the caselaw.\" In re United Healthcare, 200 F.3d at 177. As \nPlaintiffs correctly point out, the DOL's interpretive WARN regulations are authoritative in the \nThird Circuit. See id. The DOL' s comments to its regulations implementing the WARN Act \n(\"DOL Commentary\") explain whether a bankrupt entity is an \"employer\" under the WARN Act: \n[T]he Department does not think it appropriate to [ exclude all bankrupt companies \nfrom the definition of \"employer \"]. Further, DOL agrees that a fiduciary whose sole \nfunction in the bankruptcy process is to liquidate a failed business for the benefit \nof creditors does not succeed to the notice obligations of the former employer \nbecause the fiduciary is not operating a \"business enterprise\" in the normal \ncommercial sense. In other situations , where the fiduciary may continue to \noperate the business for the benefit of creditors, the fiduciary would succeed to \nthe WARN obligations of the employer precisely because the fiduciary continues \nthe business in operation. \nWorker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, 54 Fed. Reg. 16042, 16045 (Apr. 20, 1989) \n( emphasis added). This DOL Commentary provides the basis for the \"liquidating fiduciary\"5 \nexception to the WARN Act In re World Marketing Chicago, LLC, 564 B.R. 587, 599 (Bankr. \nN.D. Ill. 2017) (\"[B]ankruptcy courts that have considered the specific question of whether a \nliquidating fiduciary exception to the WARN Act applies have uniformly concluded that it does.\"). \nThe Bankruptc y Court determined that, while the Debtors announced their intention to \nliquidate prior to the Chapter 11 filing, and took steps toward liquidating, the Debtors' orderly \nwind-down process contemplated continued postpetition business operations for the benefit of \ncreditors; therefore, the Bankruptcy Court determined , the \"liquidating fiduciary\" exception did \nnot apply, and Debtors succeeded to the WARN obligations of an \"employer.\" In re Art Van \nFurniture, 638 B.R. at 536. Trustee argues on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court erred in failing to \napply the \"liquidating fiduciary\" exception because Debtors were not operating a \"business \n5 A debtor-in-possession or a trustee managing a Chapter 11 case is a fiduciary. World \nMarketing, 564 B.R. at 599 ( citations omitted). \n14 enterprise\" in the \"normal commercial sense;\" rather, Trustee argues, Debtors' sole function at the \ntime of the mass layoff was liquidating a failed business. (See D.I. 12 at 17-23). \nThe Court is not persuaded by Trustee's argument that Art Van was not an \"employer \" \nunder the statute because it was not \"operating a business enterprise\" in the \"normal commercial \nsense.\" As the DOL explained , Congress did not limit W ARN's \"employer\" definition (\"any \nbusiness enterprise \") to simply profit-making entities. Rather, any entity that is \"engaged in \nbusiness[,]\"-even public and quasi-public entities-are WARN employers if they meet the \nemployee threshold . 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.3(a)(l)(ii), 54 Fed. Reg. at 16042, 16065. For WARN \npurposes, engaging in business includes \"supply[ing] a service or good on a mercantile basis.\" 20 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 639.3(a)(l)(ii). Art Van was a merchant that sold furniture and mattresses to retail \ncustomers in its stores. \nThe kind of\"business\" that Congress meant was further clarified in the DOL Commentary. \nResponding to a commenter who suggested that bankruptc y fiduciaries be categoricall y excluded \nfrom the definition of \"employer ,\" the DOL observed that such an exception could only apply to \nfiduciaries who have ceased their engagement in business entirely: \"In other situations , where the \nfiduciary may continue to operate the business for the benefit of creditors , the fiduciary would \nsucceed to the WARN obligations of the employer precisely because the fiduciary continues the \nbusiness in operation. \" 54 Fed. Reg. at 16045 (emphasis added). Thus, a fiduciary that is a \nliquidating company remains an \"employer\" if the methods it uses to benefit creditors includes the \ncontinuation of operations in the normal commercial sense. \nAddressing the issue of whether a liquidating company remains an \"employer \" under the \nWARN Act, the Third Circuit in its United Healthcare decision looked to whether the liquidating \nfiduciary \"was operating an ongoing business enterprise , or whether it was merely engaged in the \nliquidation of assets.\" United Healthcar e, 200 F.3d at 177. United Healthcare was a \"not-for-\n15 profit corporation that provided hospital and healthcare services.\" Id. at 172. The hospital's \nsecured lender terminated all financing , rendering it unable to meet daily expenses, and its board \nvoted to accept a third-party's offer to purchase all of its assets and close the hospital. Id. at 173. \nThree days later, the hospital surrendered its state-issued certificates of need, filed a voluntary \nChapter 11 bankruptcy petition, and gave its employees notice that they would be terminated in 60 \ndays. Id. Over the next 48 hours, the hospital transferred away or sent home all its patients, and \nits employees thereafter \"were unable to perform their regular duties but instead cleaned, took \ninventory and prepared the company's assets for sale.\" Id. Sixteen days into the 60-day notice \nperiod, the hospital terminated the employees. Id. The court had to determine whether the hospital \nwas a WARN \"employer \"-that is, a \"business enterprise \"-at the time of the layoffs. Id. at 176, \nciting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(a)(l) . When the hospital surrendered its certificates of need and stopped \ntreating patients, the court observed, the hospital had ceased \"performing the everyday business \nfunctions of a hospital and health care service.\" 200 F.3d at 176. On the other hand, the hospital \n\"remained a corporation\" with employees. Id. \nFinding no clear statutory guidance, the United Healthcare court considered the DOL \nregulation and Commentary and found that the question was whether United Healthcare was \n\"engaged in business\" during the time before the layoff. Id., citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.3(a)(l)(ii ). \nThe inquiry, according to the Third Circuit, focuses on the entity's activities: \n[W]hether a bankrupt entity is an \"employer\" under the WARN Act depends on the \nnature and extent of the entity's business and commercial activities while in \nbankruptcy, and not merely on whether the entity's employees continue to work \n\"on a daily basis.\" The more closely the entity's activities resemble those of a \nbusiness operating as a going concern, the more likely it is that the entity is an \n\"employer; \" the more closely the activities resemble those of a business winding \nup its affairs, the more likely it is the entity is not subject to the WARN Act. \n200 F.3d at 178. Applying this standard, the United Healthcare court considered the hospital's \nactions-its surrender of its certificates of need, its bankruptcy petition, and the discharge and \n16 transfer of its patients. Id The court then observed : \"Significantly, after [the bankruptcy and \ncertificate filings], but in any event no later than [after the patients left], its employees were no \nlonger engaged in their regular duties but instead were performing tasks solely designed to prepare \nUnited Healthcare for liquidation. \" Id. United Healthcare 's actions were not those of a WARN \nemployer. Id. The activities revealed that the fiduciary had not continued operating the business \nas an ongoing concern. Therefore , it did not succeed to the employer's WARN obligations. Id. \nAs Plaintiffs correctly point out, the Third Circuit's \"engaged in business\" analysis is \nconsistent with the DOL's \"operating a business enterprise \" standard. Both look objectively for \nthe signs of normal operations within an entity's liquidation-not its thoughts, plans, or \nintentions-and focus upon the company 's activities in the period immediately prior to the layoffs. \nUnlike the case at bar, the business in United Healthcare presents a textbook case of a \nclean break between operations and liquidation-onl y activities: when it was open, the hospital was \n\"performing the everyday business functions of a hospital and health care service,\" but upon losing \nits financing and having to close, the hospital's employees were reduced to liquidation-only \nactivities-\"cleaning, taking inventory and preparing assets for sale.\" Id. at 173. Because the \nentity's \"sole function\" at the time of the layoff was \"liquidating a failed business,\" the liquidating \nfiduciary exception applied. 54 Fed. Reg. at 16045. \nAs Plaintiffs point out, the fiduciary here did not shut its doors and turn its retail-selling \nemployers into cleaners and shippers of equipment , machines and other assets.\" (D.I. 20 at 9). \nRather, the facts here demonstrate a \"hybrid case,\" as the Bankruptcy Court characterized it\u00ad\nongoing business operations within a liquidation. Art Van continued conducting retail sales which \nhad been, and remained, precisely the commercial business they had always engaged in-and for \nthe same purpose-to generate cash revenue. Art Van's lender funded it to continue normal retail \noperations to avoid a forced liquidation-type sale, like the one in United Healthcare. While \n17 Debtors took a large step toward liquidation when it agreed to sell 44 of its Levin stores, that sale \nwas conditioned upon those stores maintaining their normal operations while they remained in \nDebtors' hands. And Debtors' other \"closing stores\" operated no differently than its Levin \"going \nforward\" stores before Debtors pulled the plug on them all. Debtors maintained their retail \noperations in order to maximize and capture value for its creditors. \nThe Bankruptcy Court reached the wrong conclusion, according to Trustee, because the \nGOB sales operations which were ongoing at the time of the layoff were a \"necessary\" part of the \nDebtors' liquidation plan-merel y \"activities resembl[ing] those of a business winding up its \naffairs\"-and did not constitute business operations in the normal commercial sense. \"[T]here can \nbe no reasonable dispute that the Debtors were at all relevant times-both pre-Petition Date and \npost-Petition Date-liquidating, as opposed to operating their business in the normal commercial \nsense, which they stopped doing before the Petition Date and certainly did not do in these Chapter \n11 Cases.\" (D.I. 12 at 23). In support of this assertion, Trustee explains: \nHere, as in United Healthcare , the Debtors' actions from the beginning of the \nChapter 11 Cases (and before) evidence a clear, open, and public intent from the \noutset to liquidate the Debtors' stores and other assets, and not to operate their \nbusiness \"in the normal commercial sense.\" . . . [ A ]11 of the Debtors' efforts at \nreorganizing as a going concern stopped even before the Petition Date, and in fact, \nall of the Debtors' efforts prepetition to reorganize were unsuccessful. As a result \nof this failure, and before the Petition Date, the Debtors hired the Liquidator , gave \nthe GOB Sale WARN Notice and commenced GOB Sales, and issued a public \nstatement telling the world that they were liquidating their assets. When the \nDebtors ultimately filed their Chapter 11 Cases on March 8, 2020, they intended to, \nand did, continue liquidating their assets through the GOB Sales and the Levin Sale. \nAs of the Petition Date, and before the Layoff, the only business activities to be \nconducted by the Debtors were those necessary to continue liquidating their assets. \n(Id. at 22-23). Trustee appears to argue that, by taking certain actions-hiring a liquidator , \ncommencing the GOB Sales, issuing the GOB Sale WARN Notice, and publicly announcing their \nliquidation-Debtors immediately transformed themselves into WARN-exempt liquidating \nfiduciaries. But the relevant inquiry is not whether a fiduciary has a plan to liquidate. The question \n18 is whether the act of liquidation included the running of operations. Most liquidations do not, and, \nas a result, most fiduciaries will not be WARN employers. But should a fiduciary come up with a \nplan to run its operations for the benefit of creditors or otherwise , that fiduciary comes within the \nWARN Act. \nTrustee next asserts that Debtors' ongoing sales and business operations should lose their \ncommercial, mercantile character because they were in service of their creditors, rather than their \nown profit. (See D.I. 12 at 6 (purpose of wind-down was to \"maximize the liquidation value of \nthe estates' assets and the recoveries for the Debtors' creditors\") . Trustee's argument , however, \nignores the bright line drawn by the DOL Commentary: \"Where a fiduciary may continue to \noperate the business for the benefit of creditors, the fiduciary would succeed to the WARN \nobligations of the employer precisely because the fiduciary continues the business in operation. \" \n54 Fed. Reg. at 16045. This portion of the DOL Commentary is absent from the Trustee's brief, \ndespite the fact that it was relied upon by both the Bankruptcy Court and the Third Circuit. \nTrustee further claims to find support in the United Healthcare case, arguing that case \neither \"recognized \" or \"acknowledged \" that \"there would be gradations on the liquidating \nfiduciary scale and that a debtor's actions in connection with and/or in preparation of a \ngoodwill/going concern sale (including limited postpetition business operations) can be consistent \nwith and part of the liquidating fiduciary function and an exception to WARN liability.\" (D .I. 12 \nat 3, 21). Although such a proposition is not found in United Healthcare and is not supported with \na cite, the Trustee asserts that the Bankruptcy Court's reading of United Healthcare was \naccordingly \"overly narrow and erroneous .\" (Id. at 22). While the Third Circuit did speak of \n\"gradations, \" and naturally understood the liquidating fiduciary function as including the sale of \nassets, the United Healthcare court specifically reserved the WARN exemption to cases in which \nan objective evaluation reveals no normal, ongoing commercial business activities. The Court \n19 further finds no support for Trustee's assertion that the Third Circuit waived WARN liability for \na fiduciary who operates the business either \"in connection with and/or in preparation of' either a \n\"goodwill\" sale or a \"going concern sale[.]\" (Id. at 22). Nor did the Third Circuit make an \nexception when a fiduciary engages in a \"limited postpetition business operations[.] (Id.) While \nall of these activities can be \"consistent with and part of the liquidating fiduciary function,\" none \nof them support an exception to WARN liability. \nFinally, Trustee places great weight on the fact that the asset-selling debtor in United \nHealthcare was still wrapping up a transfer of its \"goodwill\" asset when it terminated its \nemployees. (See D.I. 12 at 19-21). According to Trustee, in reaching its conclusion that the \nhospital was a liquidating fiduciary, the United Healthcare court \"expressly viewed the sale of the \ndebtor's assets including the debtor's goodwill to an unrelated party named 'St. Barnabas ' (the 'St. \nBarnabas Sale') early in the chapter 11 case as part and parcel of, and consistent with, the debtor's \nliquidation which was subject to the liquidating fiduciary exception.\" Id. at 179. But the sales \nactivities in these two cases are not analogous. As Plaintiffs point out, \"goodwill\" and \"going \nconcern\" are terms used for valuation purposes when selling a business; they represent the \nintangible assets such as loyalty that go with the sale of the tangible assets, and buyers may pay \nextra for these intangibles when they plan to keep the business going. What the terms do not \nconvey is whether, at the point of sale, the business operations happen to be ongoing or not\u00ad\nwhich is the dispositive factor for the application of the WARN exemption. This argument further \nconflates the ongoing sale of abstract goodwill in United Healthcare with Debtors' ongoing brick \nand mortar operations. As the Third Circuit and Bankruptcy Court recognized, the dispositive \nissue is whether the business is operating , not whether accounting valuation terms such as \"going \nconcern\" and \"goodwill\" apply. \n20 In sum, the Bankruptcy Court's decision was a straightforward application of the DOL \nregulations and Commentary and Third Circuit precedent. Applying United Healthcare , the \nBankruptcy Court took into account the fact that Art Van was a fiduciary liquidating a business. \nDebtors' post-petition activities here, however, were the same as its pre-petition ones, in that they \nwere continuing to carry on the same business as a going concern, and \"[ w ]here a fiduciary may \ncontinue to operate the business for the benefit of creditors, the fiduciary would succeed to the \nWARN obligations of the employer precisely because the fiduciary continues the business in \noperation. \" United Healthcar e, 200 F.3d at 177 (citing 54 Fed. Reg. at 16045)). The Court will \ntherefore affirm the Bankruptc y Court's determination that the facts of this case do not satisfy the \n\"liquidating fiduciary\" exception . \nBecause the Court agrees with the Bankruptc y Court that Art Van was not a WARN\u00ad\nexempt \"liquidating fiduciary ,\" the Court will tum to the affirmative defenses available to an \n\"employer \" under the Act. \nB. The \"Natural Disaster\" Exception \nThe \"natural disaster\" exception provides that \"No notice under [the WARN Act] shall be \nrequired if the plant closing or mass layoff is due to any form of natural disaster, such as a flood, \nearthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlands of the United States.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2102(b )(2)(8) ( emphasis added). The statute and the DOL regulations state that the \"natural \ndisaster\" exception applies to \"any form of a natural disaster.\" Id.; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.9(c). The \nregulations list \"[f]loods, earthquakes , droughts, storms, tidal waves or tsunamis and similar \neffects of nature\" as natural disasters under the WARN Act. Id. The regulations further state that \n\"[t]o qualify for [the natural disaster] exception , an employer must be able to demonstrate that its \nplant closing or mass layoff is a direct result of a natural disaster.\" 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.9(c)(2) \n( emphasis added); \n21 In granting summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court determined that the COVID-19 \npandemic is a \"natural disaster\" and that the March 20, 2020 layoff was \"due to\" the pandemic. \nBecause the DOJ regulations list \"[f]loods, earthquakes, droughts, storms, tidal waves or tsunamis \nand similar effects of nature,\" 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.9(c) (emphasis added), the Bankruptc y Court \nframed the inquiry as \"whether COVID-19 arose from the 'effects of nature.\"' In re Art Van \nFurniture, 638 B.R. at 541. The Bankruptcy Court noted \"[n]umerous courts ... have considered \nthis issue and concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic is a natural disaster.\" Id. The Bankruptc y \nCourt was persuaded by the district court's analysis in Easom v. US Well Services, Inc., 527 F. \nSupp. 3d 898 (S.D. Tex. 2021). The district court in Easom reasoned that \"COVID-19 is clearly \na 'disaster\"' as \"two million people lost their lives,\" and also qualifies as a \"natural disaster\" \nbecause \"human beings were not responsible for starting or consciously spreading the virus.\" \nEasom, 527 F. Supp. 3d at 908. \"Based on the reasoning in Easom and the many cases cited \ntherein,\" the Bankruptc y Court was satisfied that the COVID-19 pandemic qualified as a \"natural \ndisaster\" under the WARN Act. \nOn appeal, Plaintiffs and Amici argue that the Bankruptcy Court erred in relying on the \nstatutory construction espoused in Easom-a decision which was subsequently overturned by the \nFifth Circuit, 37 F.4th at 244-along with inapposite cases having nothing to do with the WARN \nAct. In so holding, Plaintiffs and Amici argue, the Bankruptcy Court expanded the scope of the \n\"natural disaster\" exception to cover not only the direct effect of natural disasters, but also \neconomic downturns and government regulations spurred by a viral pandemic. Such an \napplication of the \"natural disaster\" exception, they argue, would significantly impair the WARN \nAct's remedial purpose. The Court is persuaded by the Fifth Circuit's construction of the statute. \nLegislative history and DOL regulations and guidance would further support that construction . \n22 As noted, in reaching its conclusion, the Bankruptcy Court relied principally on the district \ncourt's opinion in Easom. See In re Art Van Furniture, 638 B.R. at 540-42. In Easom, the \nemployer argued, and the district court accepted, that COVID-19 was a form of natural disaster \ncontemplated by Congress' use of the word \"any\" in \"any form of natural disaster.\" Easom, 527 \nF. Supp. 3d at 909; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(2)(B) . The Fifth Circuit disagreed. Easom, 37 F.4th at \n243-44. Citing Supreme Court precedent , the Fifth Circuit noted that even the breadth of the word \n\"any\" is limited by the canon of noscitur a sociis. Id. This canon \"counsels that a word is given \nmore precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\" Id. at 243 & n.l \n(citing Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528,544 (2015)). \"Courts rely on the canon of noscitur a \nsociis to \"avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its \naccompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\" Yates, 574 U.S. \nat 543. Here, the Fifth Circuit noted, Congress followed \"any natural disaster\" with a list of \nexamples: \"flood, earthquake , or drought.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(2)(B). In doing so, the Fifth \nCircuit held, Congress meant to limit the term's scope to \"hydrological, geological , and \nmeteorological events,\" Easom, 37 F.4th at 244. That is, disasters that could physically affect a \nplant, store, or farm. \nThe Fifth Circuit further determined that a second canon of construction supported the view \nthat COVID-19 is not a WARN \"natural disaster.\" The canon expressio unius est exclusion \nprovides that where, as here, \"the items expressed are members of an 'associated group or series,' \n[that] justif[ies] the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice, not \ninadvertence.\" Id. at 244 (quoting Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003)). The \nFifth Circuit reasoned that when it enacted WARN, \"Congress was familiar with pandemics and \ninfectious diseases\" and had enacted other legislation addressing those phenomena. Id. \n\"Congress' decision not to include disease in W ARN's 'natural disaster' examples indicates a \n23 deliberate exclusion.\" Id. The Court agrees with the Fifth Circuit's application of the canons of \nnoscitur a sociis and expressio unius est exclusion, and is persuaded that Congress's decision to \nspecify only disasters that could render continued operation of a facility physically impossible \nsupports an inference that they did not intend to include other types of calamities, even if they \ncould conceivably be considered a \"natural disaster\" under other definitions. \nFinally, the Fifth Circuit looked beyond the clause to the statute itself. It found Congress' \npurpose in enacting it was \"remedial\" based on the legislative history recognized by the Third \nCircuit of Appeals: WARN was \"adopted in response to the extensive worker dislocation that \noccurred in the 1970s and 1980s.\" Id. (citing Hotel Emps. & Rest. Emps. Int'! Union Loe. 54 v. \nElsinore Shore Assocs., 173 F.3d 175, 182 (3d Cir. 1999)). The panel therefore \"declined to \nexpand the definition of' natural disaster' beyond what is justified by the Act's statutory language, \ncontext, and purpose.\" Easom, 37 F.4th at 244. \nEven if the statute itself were ambiguous , Congress expressly authorized the DOL to \nprescribe regulations implementing the WARN Act. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107. The DOL has \nexplained that \"[ w ]here a plant closing or mass layoff occurs as an indirect result of a natural \ndisaster, the [\"natural disaster\"] exception does not apply but the \"unforeseeable business \ncircumstance\" exception ... may be applicable. \" 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.9(c)(4) (emphasis added). The \nDOL regulations , which are due deference, therefore interpret the \"unforeseeable business \ncircumstance\" exception-not the \"natural disaster\" exception-in the WARN Act to cover \ninstances , like the one here presented , where a natural disaster causes downstream effects such as \nregulatory changes or economic downturns , which in turn prompt a mass layoff. 6 \n6 The DOL further issued guidance explaining that layoffs related to COVID-19 should be \nconsidered under the \"unforeseeable business circumstance\" exception. See U.S. Dep't of \nLabor, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications Act Frequently Asked Questions \n24 Finally, in holding that COVID-19 qualifies as a \"natural disaster\" under the WARN Act, \nthe Bankruptcy Court cited a handful of cases that found COVID-19 fit within clauses of unrelated \nstatutes or contracts that referred to \"natural disasters. \" In re Art Van Furniture, 638 B.R. at 542, \nn.111 (''Numerous courts, however, have considered this issue and concluded that the COVID-19 \npandemic is a natural disaster\"). But as Amici point out, these cases have nothing to do with the \nWARN Act and shed no light on how the particular language of the WARN Act should be \nconstrued. For example, one case dealt with the Pennsylvania Emergency Code, which applies to \nall \"man-made [or] natural disaster[ s ]\" as long as they threaten, cause, or result in \"substantial \ndamage to property, hardship, suffering or possible loss of life,\" as well as \"war-caused disasters\" \nthat result in \"substantial damage to property or injury to persons in the United States.\" 35 Pa. \nStat. & Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7102 (West 2020) (emphasis added); see Friends of Danny De Vito v. \nWolf, 227 A.3d 872, 887 (Penn. 2020). Another dealt with the Pennsylvania Election Code, which \ngrants \"authority to provide relief when there is a natural disaster or emergency. \" Penn. \nDemocratic Party v. Boockvar, 238 A.3d 345, 363 (Penn. 2020) (emphasis added) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). As Amici correctly point out, these are state statutes designed to ensure \nthe government has adequate power to respond to emergencies of any nature; they are not \nprovisions delineating a limited exception to a remedial federal statute. The fact that COVID-19 \nmay qualify as a \"natural disaster\" in some statutory contexts does not mean it does so in all \nstatutory contexts. Other cases included in the Bankruptcy Court's string citation considered \nclauses in contracts between private parties, which are even less probative here, and the wording \nand context of those clauses similarly show an intent to sweep far broader than the WARN Act's \nlanguage . See JN Contemp. Art LLC v. Phillips Auctioneers LLC, 507 F.Supp.3d 490, 496 \n2, https://bit.ly/3LFjN3G (last visited Dec. 11, 2022). While this guidance document is not \ncontrolling, it is consistent with the Fifth Circuit's determination in Easom. \n25 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (contractual provision referring to any \"circumstances beyond our or your \nreasonable control, including, without limitation , as a result of natural disaster ... \"); AB Stable VIII \nLLC v. Maps Hotels & Resorts One LLC, 2020 WL 7024929, at *53-54 (Del. Ch. Nov. 30, 2020) \n( contractual provision referring generally to \"natural disasters or calamities\"). \nBased on the Fifth Circuit's thoughtful construction , the DOL regulations , and the remedial \npurpose of the statute, the Court must agree that the COVID-19 pandemic does not satisfy the \nWARN Act's \"natural disaster\" exception , and the Order is reversed with respect to that holding. \nC. The \"Unforeseeable Business Circumstances\" Exception \nThe \"unforeseeable business circumstances \" ( or \"UBC\") exception to the WARN Act \nprovides that: \"An employer may order a plant closing or mass layoff before the conclusion of the \n60-day period if the closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not \nreasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2102(b)(2)(A). The employer bears the burden of proving that this exception applies by \nestablishing that two conditions are met: (1) the circumstance was unforeseeable , and (2) the \nlayoffs were caused by that circumstance. Gross v. Hale-Halsell Co., 554 F.3d 870,875 (10th Cir. \n2009) (citing Roquet v. Arthur Andersen LLP, 398 F.3d 585, 588 (7th Cir. 2005)). The court \nshould evaluate the UBC exception objectivel y and at the time the decisions were made. In re \nJevic Holding Corp ., 496 B.R. 151, 161 (Bankr. D. Del. 2013) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiffs did not contest foreseeability ; rather, they argued that the Trustee had not \nsatisfied his burden of demonstrating that the pandemic \"caused\" the layoff. Regarding causation , \nthe Bankruptcy Court accepted undisputed facts that the Debtors were in dire financial straits \nleading up to the Chapter 11 filing; the Debtors filed Chapter 11 to pursue an orderly wind-down \nof operations and liquidation of their assets; COVID-19, and the government-ordered business \nclosures ( or threatened closures) and the restriction of residents to their homes, prevented the \n26 Debtors from conducting the GOB sales and completing the orderly liquidation of its business. In \nre Art Van Furniture , 638 B.R. at 538-39. Once an employer comes forward with evidence that, \nif unrebutted , would establish a defense to a WARN Act violation, the burden shifts to the \nemployee to \"produce 'evidence in the record creating a genuine issue of material fact.'\" FBI Wind \nDown, Inc., 614 B.R. 460, 472 (Bankr. D. Del. 2020)). Without an opportunity to conduct \ndiscovery , Plaintiffs countered that COVID-19 did not mandate the Debtors' mass layoff of \nemployees on March 20, 2020, as other options, including a temporary employee furlough, existed. \nMoreover , \nPlaintiffs pointed to statements made by counsel for the Debtors, Wells Fargo, and \nthe Creditor Committee at a hearing on March 19, 2020, where counsel all \nsuggested that the parties were working on alternatives to \"pulling the plug\" and \navoid an immediate shutdown. Plaintiffs also point out that the permanent mass \nlayoff triggered \"insurmountable obligations \" of at least $16.5 million arising from \ncommissions suddenly due when salespeople were laid off, and an even more \nsubstantial tail created by the partially self-funded health plan which was cancelled \non March 19, 2020. \nIn re Art Van Furniture, 638 B.R. at 538, n.92 & 93. Finally, Plaintiffs cited Wells Fargo's \nstatements at the March 19 hearing that, while it wanted to \"find a path forward for all \nstakeholders ,\" Debtors had not \"fully come to their creditors,\" made Wells Fargo aware of its \ndecisions only \"minutes before these hearings,\" and that \"there had been no contemplation of a \nwholesale mass termination of employees.\" (3/19/20 Tr. at 27:9-28:13, 30:1-9, 37:4-9). \nThe Bankruptcy Court determined the record evidence proffered by Plaintiffs did not \ndemonstrate disputed issues of material facts casting doubt on the causation element of Debtors' \ndefense--that \"COVID-19 was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back' and caused the \nMarch 20 , 2020 layoff.\" In re Art Van Furnitur e, 638 B.R. at 539. Even viewing all inferences \nin favor of the Plaintiffs , the Bankruptc y Court determined that: \nStatements showing that the Debtors' actions were unanticipated or resulted in \ngreater financial distress do not indicate disputed facts concerning the cause of the \n27 layoff. Rather, those facts underscore that the impact ofCOVID-19 was sudden and \nunexpected to other parties as well as the Debtors. Counsels' statements expressing \na hope that the closure would only 'pause' the orderly liquidation process as the \nparties explored alternatives to 'outright liquidation' also do not refute the cause of \nthe layoff. Plaintiffs' argument that temporary furloughs could have been a better \noption for the Debtors is not a factual dispute, but merely debating the Debtors' \nactions in hindsight. \nId at 539. The Court agrees with the Bankruptc y Court's determination that this evidence does \nnot meet the standard. Plaintiffs were required to \"produce 'evidence in the record creating a \ngenuine issue of material fact.'\" In re FBI Wind Down 614 B.R. at 472. \"The evidence illustrating \nthe factual controversy cannot be conjectural or problematic; it must have substance in the sense \nthat it limns differing versions of the truth which a factfinder must resolve.\" Medina-Munoz v. R.J \nReynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) ( quoting Mack v. Great Atlantic and Pacific \nTea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir. 1989)). Plaintiffs failed to produce such \"evidence in the \nrecord.\" That might be the end of the matter had Plaintiffs been permitted to develop such record \nevidence in the first place. \nThe WARN Act's exceptions are narrow, fact-bound defenses that ask whether the \ncircumstances to which the employer points actually caused the layoffs. The Bankruptcy Court \ndenied Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to defer ruling to take discovery on the Trustee's defenses. As \nPlaintiffs and Amici correctly argue, without an opportunity for discovery, employees have no \nability to test this crucial question. The Court agrees that the Bankruptcy Court abused its \ndiscretion in granting summary judgment under Rule 56 without allowing Plaintiffs to take \ndiscovery under Rule 56( d). \n\"[I]t is well established that a court 'is obliged to give a party opposing summary judgment \nan adequate opportunity to obtain discovery .\"' Abington Friends, 480 F.3d at 257 (citing Dowling \nv. City of Philadelphia , 855 F.2d 136, 139 (3d Cir. 1988)). This is necessary because, by its very \nnature, the summary judgment process presupposes the existence of an adequate record. Abington \n28 Friends, 480 F.3d at 257; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (summary judgment is decided on the basis \nof the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories , and admissions on file, together with the \naffidavits , if any\"); Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 257 (explaining the non-moving party's burden at \nsummary judgment rests on the assumption that the party \"had a full opportunity to conduct \ndiscovery\") . \nThe non-movant, in response to a motion for summary judgment , may bring a motion to \ndefer a ruling. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). \"District courts usually grant properly filed Rule 56(f) [now \nRule 56(d)] motions as a matter of course.\" Abington Friends, 480 F.3d at 256 (citing St. Surin v. \nVI Daily News, Inc.,21 F.3d 1309, 1314(3dCir.1994)(intemalquotationmarksomitted)). The \npropriety of such a motion is particularly evident when there are discovery requests outstanding or \nwhere relevant facts are under the control of the moving party. See Ward v. United States, 471 \nF.2d 667,670 (3d Cir. 1973) (where moving party controls evidence, motions to continue summary \njudgment \"should, we think, ordinarily be granted almost as a matter of course\"); Costlow v. United \nStates, 552 F.2d 560, 562-64 (3d Cir. 1977) (citing Ward and finding error in lower court's denial \nof such a motion)). If discovery is incomplete in any way material to a pending summary judgment \nmotion, the court is not justified in denying the non-movant ' s motion to continue summary \njudgment. See Miller v. Beneficial Mgmt. Corp., 977 F.2d 834, 845--46 (3d Cir.1992) (where \ndefendant's employees, who participated in the promotion and salary decisions regarding the \nplaintiff, had not been deposed, lower court abused discretion in deciding summary judgment on \nplaintiffs discrimination claims without allowing opportunity for discovery). \nIt appears undisputed that Trustee moved for summary judgment having produced a total \nof three largely redacted documents (PAO 1014 1 7), and less than two weeks after serving an \nAmended Answer asserting an additional affirmative defense. (PA00036; PA00063; PA00065; \nPA00097). Plaintiffs Cross-Motion to defer ruling on the summary judgment motion explained \n29 that such a decision would be premature as Plaintiffs had not had an opportunity to conduct \nmeaningful discovery on the Trustee's fact-intensive affirmative defenses. (PA00985-PA00986). \nThe Roupinian Declaration attached to Plaintiffs' opposition and Cross-Motion detailed the \nnumerous discovery requests which were pending at the time the Trustee moved for summary \njudgment. (PA01012-PA01015). The Declaration further identified the topics that were needed \nto respond to the factual allegations underlying Art Van's \"unforeseeable business circumstance \" \naffirmative defense. (See Declaration , ,r 15 (PAO 1015) (Plaintiffs could not adequately oppose the \ndefenses without discovery on \"Defendants ' purported liquidation process, the operations of the \nstores during the pendency of the bankruptcy , Defendants' efforts to obtain financing, and the \ndecision-making process that led to the terminations of Defendants' employees .\")) In sum, \nPlaintiffs had sought discovery of decisional documents and communications leading up to the \nemployee terminations--documents which are probative of the cause, element and therefore \nmaterial to Plaintiff's ability to test the Trustee's affirmative defense. (PA00982-86 ; PA01274). \nIndeed, Plaintiffs went beyond the requirements of Rule 56( d) by stating in their papers \nfacts already in the record which may undermine Debtors' affirmative defenses, such as the \ndiscrepancies between Debtors' in-court and out-of-court explanations for the layoffs and \nabandonment of the wind-down plan, and Wells Fargo's claim that Art Van had not provided \nsufficient information to support the wind-down plan. But such an affirmative showing is not \nnecessary for Rule 56(d) purposes. See Abington , 480 F.3d at 258 n.8 (rejecting defendant's \nargument that plaintiffs needed to \"detail[] those facts within their knowledge that might\" rebut \nthe defendant's summary judgment theory, holding that \"[w]e will not fault the Does for failing to \nprovide information principally within the control of Abington and which they could only have \nknown secondhand.\"); Harley v. Paulson, 2008 WL 5189931, at *6 (D.N.J. Dec. 9, 2008) \n30 (\"Plaintiff must be given an opportunity to seek contradictory evidence m Defendant's \npossession.\"). \nA court cannot grant summary judgment on the ground that \"Plaintiffs' proffered evidence \n... is tenuous,\" while also denying Plaintiffs discovery into questions to which the Federal Rules \nentitle them. Abington Friends, 480 F.3d at 257 (\"If discovery is incomplete in any way material \nto a pending summary judgment motion, a district court is justified in not granting the motion.\") \nThe Opinion faults Plaintiffs for failing to produce evidence in the record creating a genuine issue \nof material fact casting doubt as to the cause of the layoff, but any such evidence was in the \nTrustee's possession, and Plaintiffs were denied the opportunity to obtain the documents or \ndeposition testimony necessary to test that element. Indeed, the Court has found no other decision \ngranting summary judgment on the \"unforeseeable business circumstance\" defense--or any other \naffirmative defense under W ARN--except on an evidentiary record after the close of discovery . \nThe Bankruptcy Court's decision to deny the Cross-Motion to defer ruling was an abuse of \ndiscretion. Accordingly, this Court will reverse and remand the case to allow for discovery on the \nmerits of the \"unforeseeable business circumstance \" defense. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Order is affirmed in part and reversed in part. An \nappropriate order follows. \n31 "}
