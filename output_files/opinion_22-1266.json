Andrews", "date": "02-15-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCOMMODITY FUTURES TRADING \nCOMMISSION , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nFIRST STATE DEPOSITORY COMPANY , \nLLC, ARGENT ASSET GROUP, LLC, \nAND ROBERT LEROY HIGGINS, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 22-1266-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is the Receiver's Amended Motion for an Order Establishing a Distribution \nand Claims Adjudication Process. (D.I. 91). The motion is joined by Claimants Maria and \nVeronica Carrozza. (D.I. 100). The motion is opposed by the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission (CFTC). (D.I. 95). The opposition is joined by Claimant Robert Bohli. (D.I. 96). I \nhave considered the briefing (D.I. 91, 95, 101) andjoinders (D.I. 96, 100). For the reasons set \nforth below, the Receiver's motion is GRANTED . \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis motion arises from a lawsuit by the CFTC against First State Depository Company \n(\"FSD\"), Argent Asset Group (\"Argent), and their owner, Robert Leroy Higgins. FSD provided \n\"depository storage services,\" storing \"precious metals and valuables\" for its customers. (D.I. 2 1 \n16). The complaint alleges that in the course of operating FSD and Argent, Mr. Higgins made \nvarious false and misleading statements and misappropriated customer funds and metals. (See \ngenerally D.I. 2). I granted the CFTC's motion to appoint Mr. Kelly Crawford (\"the Receiver\") \n1 as an equity receiver to secure and recover the Defendants ' assets. (D.I. 12, 57). All Defendants \nare in default. (D.I. 77). \nThe Receiver retained an accounting firm to inspect the Defendants' premises and review \ntheir records. (D.I. 91 at 2). While many assets were located and appropriately associated with \ncustomer accounts (D.I. 78 at 2), the missing assets are valued at $58.9 to $112.7 million. (D.I. \n93 at 2). Many of the assets, missing and found, are \"non-fungible , rare collectible items\" that \ncould not be immediately valued. (D.I. 78 at 3). \nThe Receiver's Motion proposes a plan to return all assets being held in custody and to \ncompensate those customers of FSD who had assets missing by liquidating the Defendants ' \nassets and any other excess or unidentified assets. (D.I. 91 at 3). Under the Receiver 's plan, \ncustomers whose assets were not compromised will recover in full, less administrative expenses , \nwhile customers whose assets were compromised will receive whatever of their assets were \nfound and a pro rat a recovery. Id. The first group of uncompromised customers numbers about \n1,083 customers (D.I. 82-1 at 10 of 72 tbl.l, hereinafter \"Table l \") with assets valued at about \n$21-$31 million (D.I. 82-1 at 11 of 72 tbl.2, hereinafter \"Table 2\"). 1 The second group of \ncompromised customers numbers about 1,013 customers (Table 1) with assets valued at about \n$87-$159 million (Table 2).2 For the second group, there are about $26-$42 million of assets \nidentifiable with a particular customer (Table 2, D.I. 82-1 at 11 of 72 tbl.3, hereinafter \"Table \n1 I reach 1,083 customers by summing 1,065 customers with no discrepancies and 18 customers \nwith strictly excess inventory . For this and the following ranges of asset valuations , I round the \nlower bound down to the nearest whole million and upper bound up to the nearest whole million. \n2 I reach this range of valuations by summing the lower bounds of the found and missing assets \nand the upper bounds of the same reported in Table 2 and then rounding as described above in \nnote 1. \n2 3\")3 and commingled assets of about $8-$12 million available for distribution (Table 3),4 \nmeaning that on average the second group is looking at a recovery of about 34-3 9%. 5 If recovery \nwere to be pro rata across all customers , on average all customers would be looking to recover \nabout 42-46%.(Table 2, 3).6 The CFTC opposes the Receiver 's Motion to the extent that it does \nnot provide for a pro rata distribution across all customers-uncompromised and compromised. \n(D.I. 95 at 1-2). \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe Receiver and the CFTC agree that \"a pro rata distribution is the most fair and \nequitable method of distribution in an equity receivership .\" (D.I. 101 at 1). I, too, agree. The only \ndisputed issue is whether those assets that \"sit in segregated boxes in the vault of Defendant 's \ndepository with the customer 's account number\" (the \"Located Assets\")7 are part of the \nreceivership estate. Id. If they are part of the receivership estate, then they may be distributed on \na pro rata basis either through liquidation or, for fungible assets, directly. However , if they are \n3 Some compromised accounts are missing some assets but have extras of others. The tables do \nnot report precisely how much is associated with compromised accounts but is not excess. This is \na rough estimate inferred from the information provided. \n4 I am counting the following as commingled assets, as reported in Table 3: Excess Inventory , \nUnassigned/ Argent, R. Higgins' Related Accounts. I rounded the ranges as described in note 1. \n5 I ballpark average recovery by calculating recovery using all low estimates (39%) and all high \nestimates (34%), rounding to the nearest percent. For any individual , recovery may be \nsubstantially less than average, particularly for individuals for whom no inventory has been \nlocated. For them, using the same method as above, I estimate the likely recovery as closer to \n10-13%. \n6 I am calculating the overall pro rata average by simply using the total amount found versus the \ntotal amount that should have been found. \n7 What I am calling the \"Located Assets\" does not include assets of customers registered for \nFSD's \"Silver Lease Program,\" who \"granted the Defendants 'control' over their silver.\" (D.I. \n101 at 2 n.1). The Receiver proposes to handle these customers' recovery separately , and the \nCFTC does not seem to dispute this. \n3 not part of the receivership estate, they must be returned to the customers to whom they belong. \nFor the following reasons, I reluctantly conclude that they are not part of the receivership estate. \nThe Receiver argues that FSD's customers , and not the Defendants, hold title to the \nLocated Assets. He notes that the assets are not \"merely ... traceable \" but were actually \n\"segregated in the manner of true trust accounts. \" SEC v. Credit Bancorp, 290 F.3d 80, 90 (2d \nCir. 2002). The customers \"did not ever authorize the Defendants to exercise any control over \nthe assets.\" (D .I. 101 at 2). The Receiver likens these assets to those in safety deposit boxes at \nbanks. He notes, \"A receivership of a bank or a storage facility does not entitle the receiver to \nliquidate the assets in the safety deposit boxes or the storage units.\" Id. \nThe Receiver argues that because the customers continue to hold title to the Located \nAssets, under SEC v. Black, the assets must be returned. (D .I. 101 at 4). In that case, the Third \nCircuit affirmed the release and return of frozen funds from a receivership because \"the \nDefendants did not have 'control' ... so as to permit [the court] to freeze the funds.\" SEC v. \nBlack, 163 F.3d 188, 196 (3d Cir. 1998). The Receiver also compares the present situation to a \nbankruptcy proceeding , where \"assets lawfully held in trust\" would not be part of the bankruptcy \nestate. (D.I. 101 at 6 (citing City of Philadelphia v. Lieberman, 112 F.2d 424,426 (3d Cir. \n1940))). \nThe CFTC takes the position that the Located Assets should be combined with the rest of \nthe assets and distributed pro rata to all ofFSD's customers. The CFTC notes that the return of \nthe Located Assets would constitute \"tracing,\" in which \"customers who can trace their funds to \na specific account or location have those funds returned in full, while customers who cannot do \nso are deprioritized. \" (D.I. 95 at 3). The CFTC then observes that \"for purposes of equity, tracing \nprinciples can be suspended. \" CFTC v. Eustace, 2008 WL 471574, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 19, \n4 2008) (citing Cunningham v. Brown, 265 U.S. 1 (1924)). The CFTC argues that any ownership \nby FSD customers is merely a matter of \"contractual obligation\" (D.I. 95 at 4), and that, at least \nin some Circuits, a \"court is not required to distributed the assets in accordance with the \ncontractual rights of the parties.\" SEC v. Quan, 870 F.3d 754, 762 (8th Cir. 2017). The CFTC \nalso argues that the FSD customers' assets were \"actually controlled by Defendants\" because \nthey were held on Defendants ' premises (D.I. 95 at 6), and \"Defendants essentially treated FSD \nas their personal piggy bank.\" (Id. at 8). \nThe CFTC further argues that neither principles from bankruptcy nor Black apply to the \npresent case. The CFTC cites Eustace, which notes, \"When an equity receivership is involved, \ncase law concerning equity receiverships is generally more applicable than bankruptcy case \nlaw.\" 2008 WL 471574, at *7. Then, the CFTC distinguishes between the level of control here \nand in Black, because the assets released in Black were held by third party financial institutions. \nThe CFTC argues that in Black and similar cases, \"the traceable proceeds were placed beyond \nthe control of the defrauding entity.\" (D.I. 95 at 7 (citing SEC v. Bivona, 2017 WL 4022485 , at \n*7 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2017))). \nI first note that none of the cases cited by either the Receiver or the CFTC concern the \nreturn or redistribution of physical assets, some of which are non-fungible, as is the case here. \nThus, none applies cleanly to the present case. \nOverall, I agree with the Receiver that FSD customers still hold title to the Located \nAssets. Their claims are more than a matter of mere \"contractual rights.\" Therefore , I think this \nis not simply an application of tracing. I defined the Receivership Estate-in an order drafted by \nthe CFTC-as \"all of the funds, properties , premises, accounts, income, now or hereafter due or \nowing to the Defendants , and other assets directly or indirectly owned beneficially or otherwise, \n5 by the Defendants.\" (D.I. 57 if 60). If FSD customers still hold title to the Located Assets, they \nseem to fall outside this definition. \nWhile Defendants did exercise more control over assets stored with FSD than a bank \nwould have with a customer's items placed in a safe deposit box, Defendants still exercised less \ncontrol than in cases such as Black, where the defendant was authorized to manage client funds. \nBlack, 163 F.3d at 192. \nAlthough bankruptcy cases are not binding on my decision here, as equity proceedings , \nthey are informative about how to treat assets held for others. The consensus in bankruptcy cases \nseems to be that such assets are not part of the bankruptcy estate. See Torkelsen v. Maggio (In re \nGuild & Gallery Plus), 72 F.3d 1171, 1179-80 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. Whiting \nPools, 462 U.S. 198 (1983)); Lieberman , 112 F.2d at 426. I think the same conclusion is sensible \nhere.8 \nTherefore, the Receiver's Motion (D.I. 91) is GRANTED , and I will sign the Receiver's \nproposed order (D.I. 91, Ex. 2). \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nEntered this /.S:ay of February , 2023 \n8 I note that the Receiver's plan is simpler than the CFTC's and thus may be less expensive and \nmore expeditious to implement. One consequence of the CFTC's proposal is that it seems likely \nalmost all the assets would have to be liquidated , and that decisions would have to be made \nasset-by-asset. The Receiver's plan anticipates that a much greater percentage of the assets will \nnot have to be liquidated. I mention this in a footnote because I see this as a collateral benefit of \nthe Receiver's plan, but not a reason to adopt the Receiver 's plan. \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCOMMODITY FUTURES TRADING \nCOMMISSION , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nFIRST STATE DEPOSITORY COMPANY , \nLLC, ARGENT ASSET GROUP, LLC, \nAND ROBERT LEROY HIGGINS , \nDefendan ts.
