Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993), the Supreme Court\n\nexplained that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 creates \u201ca gatekeeping role for the [trial] judge\u201d in\n\n2 Arendi has filed separate Daubert motions challenging Dr. Rinard in the Motorola Action and\nin the Google Action, but the parties\u2019 briefs filed in connection with those two motions are\nessentially identical. Thus, the Court will address these two motions together.\n\n3\norder to \u201censur{e] that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to\nthe task at hand.\u201d The rule requires that expert testimony \u201chelp the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 702(a). Expert testimony is admissible\nonly if \u201cthe testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,\u201d \u201cthe testimony is the product of\nreliable principles and methods,\u201d and \u201cthe expert has reliably applied the principles and methods\nto the facts of the case.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d). There are three distinct requirements for\nadmissible expert testimony: (1) the expert must be qualified; (2) the opinion must be reliable;\nand (3) the expert\u2019s opinion must relate to the facts. See generally Elcock v. Kmart Corp., 233\nF.3d 734, 741-46 (3d Cir. 2000). Rule 702 embodies a \u201cliberal policy of admissibility.\u201d Pineda\ny. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir. 2008). Motions to exclude evidence are\ncommitted to the Court\u2019s discretion. See In re Paoli R. R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 749 (3d\nCir. 1994).\n\nB. Summary Judgment And Federal Rule Of Civil Procedure 56\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574,\n586 n.10 (1986). An assertion that a fact cannot be \u2014 or, alternatively, is \u2014 genuinely disputed\nmust be supported either by citing to \u201cparticular parts of materials in the record, including\ndepositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations\n(including those made for the purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers,\nor other materials,\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or\n\npresence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\nsupport the fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B). If the moving party has carried its burden,\nthe nonmovant must then \u201ccome forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue\nfor trial.\u2019 Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 (intemal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The\nCourt will \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make\ncredibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,\n530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).\n\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586; see also Podohnik v. U.S. Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating\nparty opposing summary judgment \u201cmust present more than just bare assertions, conclusory\nallegations or suspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue\u201d) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). However, the \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will\nnot defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment,\u201d and a factual dispute\nis genuine only where \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\nnonmoving party.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). \u201cIf the\nevidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be\ngranted.\u201d Jd. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n317, 322 (1986) (stating entry of summary judgment is mandated \u201cagainst a party who fails to\nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case,\nand on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial\u201d). Thus, the \u201cmere existence of a\nscintilla of evidence\u201d in support of the non-moving party\u2019s position is insufficient to defeat a\nmotion for summary judgment; there must be \u201cevidence on which the jury could reasonably\n\nfind\u201d for the non-moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.\nIl. DISCUSSION\nA. Daubert Motions\n1. Shamos\nArendi seeks to exclude portions of Dr. Shamos\u2019 expert report that are purportedly\n\u201cinconsistent with the Court\u2019s claim construction.\u201d (C.A. No. 12-1597 D.I. 191 at 2) The\nportions at issue relate to the claim term \u201cto determine if the first information is at least one of a\nplurality of types of information that can be searched for.\u201d (Jd. at 3) The Court has construed\nthis claim term as:\nto determine if the first information belongs to one or more of\nseveral predefined categories of identifying information (e.g., a /\nname) or contact information (e.g., a phone number, a fax number, '\nor an email address) that can be searched for in an information\nsource external to the document.\n(Id. DJ. 125 at 13-15) In his report, Dr. Shamos opines that the claim term is not met because\n\nthe Accused Devices \u201cdo not perform any analysis to determine whether the first information\n\n\u2018can be searched for... .\u201d\u201d (Id, D.I. 192 Ex. 1 4 69; see also id. \u00a7 133 (\u201c[The Accused\n\nApplications] do not determine whether any information at all \u2018can be searched for....\u2019\u201d))\n\nThe Court agrees with Arendi and will grant its Daubert motion. Under the Court\u2019s\nconstruction, an infringing product must analyze to determine, while a document is being\ndisplayed, whether the first information \u201cbelongs to one or more of several predefined categories\nof identifying information . . . or contact information.\u201d While the eligible \u201cpredefined\ncategories\u201d of information must be categories \u201cthat can be searched for in an information source\nexternal to the document,\u201d the Court\u2019s construction does not require that the searchability\ndetermination of the first information must be made by the accused infringing products while\n\nperforming this step of the claimed process. The contrary interpretation of the term would\neffectively read the word \u201cpredefined\u201d out of the Court\u2019s construction. In other words, \u201cthe\n\nphrase \u2018that can be searched for\u2019 modifies the allowable \u201cpredefined categories\u2019 and does not\n\nspecify a distinct determination to be made.\u201d (/d. D.I. 191 at 4) It follows that Dr. Shamos is\n\nattempting to impose an additional limitation not in the claims and his opinions on this point\n\nmust be excluded. See Personalized User Model, L.L.P. v. Google Inc., 2014 WL 807736, at *1\n\n(D. Del. Feb. 27, 2014) (excluding expert report for failure to apply Court\u2019s claim constructions).\n2. Rinard?\n\na. \u201cDetermine If The First Information Is At Least One Of A\nPlurality Of Types Of Information That Can Be Searched For\u201d\n\nFor the same reasons provided in connection with Arendi\u2019s Daubert motion regarding Dr.\nShamos (see supra II.A.1), the Court will grant this portion of Arendi\u2019s motion (C.A. No. 12-\n1601 D.L. 266 at 3-7).4 Dr. Rinard is precluded from testifying that the Accused Devices or\nAccused Apps do not satisfy the claim limitation because they do not determine the searchability\n\nof the first information.\n\n3 Motorola and Google contend that Arendi\u2019s Daubert motion is untimely, prejudicial, and fails\nto address the Pennypack factors. (See C.A. No. 12-1601 D.I. 334 at 16-18; see also Tr. at 64)\nThe Court disagrees. Arendi\u2019s Daubert motion was timely filed pursuant to the scheduling\norder. Motorola and Google cite no authority supporting the suggestion that a Daubert motion\nseeking to exclude expert opinions on reliability grounds must address the Pennypack factors.\n\n4 During the claim construction stage of these cases, Arendi \u201cargued that the claim language was\nclear as to where the search can be performed for purposes of the determining step.\u201d (C.A. No.\n12-1601 D.J. 334 at 6-7) (emphasis added) Arendi did not advocate for the position that the\nclaimed process requires a searchability determination. Hence, Arendi has not been inconsistent,\nas Motorola and Google unpersuasively contend.\nb. \u201cAnalyzing, In A Computer Process,\nFirst Information In A Document\u201d\n\nArendi seeks to exclude portions of Dr. Rinard\u2019s report in which he opines that, to\nestablish infringement, Arendi must show that the \u201canalyzing\u201d step is performed on the alleged\n\u201cfirst information\u201d and not on any additional information. (See id. D.L. 266 at 7-9; see also id.\nD.L 267 Ex. 1 99 395-412) The Court will grant Arendi\u2019s motion.\n\nDr. Rinard has failed to apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the claim term, which no\nparty asked the Court to construe. The term does not require analyzing only the first information\nin a document. Instead, analysis of other information in addition to the first information \u2014\nincluding \u201ctext that includes first information\u201d or \u201cpassages encompassing first information\u201d (id.\nD.L. 334 at 9-10) \u2014 does not fall outside of the claim scope. In other words, this claim limitation\nis satisfied when the first information in a document is analyzed, regardless of whether other\ninformation is also analyzed.\u00b0\n\nDr. Rinard has also impermissibly advanced his own claim construction in his expert\nreport. He attempts to impose his own construction of this term by relying on a purported\n\u201cdisclaimer\u201d made during prosecution. (See id. D.J. 267 Ex. 1 \u00a7[ 395-97) This is not a task for\nan expert witness. See generally Cordis Corp. v. Boston Sci. Corp., 561 F.3d 1319, 1337 (Fed.\nCir. 2009) (\u201c[I]t is improper to argue claim construction to the jury.\u201d).\n\ne. \u201cPerforming An Action Using\nAt Least Part Of The Second Information\u201d\n\nArendi seeks to exclude a portion of Dr. Rinard\u2019s expert report which opines that actions\n\ninvolving merely display of second information do not satisfy this claim element. (See C.A. No.\n\n5 Contrary to Motorola and Google\u2019s contention (see, e.g., C.A. No. 12-1601 D.1. 334 at 10-11),\nthe Court\u2019s construction of \u201cfirst information\u201d does not suggest the analysis is limited solely to\nthe first information.\n12-1601 D.L. 266 at 9-11; see also id. DI. 267 Ex. 1 \u00a7{] 327-41) This portion of Arendi\u2019s motion\nwill also be granted.\n\nThe Court agrees with Arendi that Dr. Rinard has imposed his own construction on this\nunconstrued claim term, rather than applying its plain and ordinary meaning. In his expert\nreport, Dr. Rinard purported to apply canons of claim construction (see id. 1 333); he also reads\nlimitations from specification embodiments into the claim (see id. | 334) and cites to the\nprosecution history (see id. [335). In the end, he adopts a claim construction that impermissibly\nnarrows the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. Therefore, Dr. Rinard is precluded from\ntestifying that the Accused Devices and Accused Apps do not infringe because they merely\ndisplay the second information.\n\nd. Whether \u201cPerforming An Action\u201d\nMust Occur In The \u201cFirst Computer Program\u201d\n\nArendi seeks to exclude another portion of Dr. Rinard\u2019s expert report, in which he opines\nthat the claim limitation \u201cperforming an action using at least part of the second information\u201d\nmust occur within the first computer program. (See id. D.I. 266 at 12-13; see also id. D.I. 267\nEx. | 9352-73) Given Motorola and Google\u2019s clarification and assurance that Dr. Rinard\nNN (1c. 0.1. 334 at 16), this portion of\n\nArendi\u2019s motion will be denied as moot.\u00ae\n\n6 To the extent Arendi contends that Dr. Rinard has failed to disclose in his report his opinion\nthat\n\nI (C.A. No. 12-1601 D.I. 358 at 9; see also id. D.I. 334 at 15), this is an issue that\ncan be presented in the pretrial order and/or at trial. It is not a basis for granting a Daubert\nmotion.\n3. Myers\nFor the same reasons provided in connection with Arendi\u2019s Daubert motion regarding Dr.\nShamos (see supra IL.A.1), the Court will grant this portion of Arendi\u2019s motion (C.A. No. 12-\n1602 D.I. 224 at 2-5). Mr. Myers is precluded from testifying that the Accused Devices or\nAccused Apps do not satisfy the claim limitation because they do not determine the searchability\nof the first information.\nB. Motions For Summary Judgment\n1. Google\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment Of Non-Infringement\nGoogle moves for summary judgment of non-infringement on the grounds that its\nAccused Apps do not satisfy several claim limitations: (1) \u201cdocument\u201d (see C.A. No. 13-919 DI.\n276 at 16-22); (2) \u201cdetermine if the first information is at least one of plurality of types of\ninformation that can be searched for\u201d (see id, at 23-27); and (3) \u201cproviding an input device\nconfigured by the first computer program\u201d and \u201cin consequence of receipt by the first computer\nprogram of the user command from the input device\u201d (see id. at 27-40).\na. \u201cDocument\u201d\ni. Linkify And Smart Linkify\nGoogle first contends that summary judgment of non-infringement should be granted\nwith respect to the Accused Apps operating in conjunction with the Linkify and the Smart\nLinkify functionalities.\u2019 (See id. D.I. 276 at 18-19) According to Google, since these\n\nfunctionalities \u201conly operate on text that is not editable\u201d (id. at 18), the Accused Apps operating\n\n7 These Accused Apps include: Google Messages, Calendar, Hangouts, Tasks, Docs, Slides, and\nSheets. The specific date ranges of these apps operating in conjunction with Linkify and Smart\nLinkify are detailed in an appendix attached to Google\u2019s reply brief. (See C.A. No. 13-919 DI.\n276 at 18; id. D.I. 370 App\u2019x 1)\n\n10\nin conjunction with them cannot meet the claim limitation \u201cwhile the document is being\ndisplayed, analyzing . . . first information from the document.\u201d In Google\u2019s view, under the\nCourt\u2019s claim construction, the term \u201cdocument\u201d must be \u201ca word processing, spreadsheet, or\nsimilar file into which text can be entered.\u201d (Id. D.1. 143 at 5) (emphasis added)\n\nDuring the consolidated hearing, Arendi confirmed that there is no dispute that Linkify\nand Smart Linkify work only in conjunction with non-editable files. (See Tr. at 36) Arendi\ncontends, however, that \u201cdocument[s]\u201d need not be editable \u201cthroughout the entire claim, [and]\nthroughout the entire process.\u201d (Id. at 27) According to Arendi, the files analyzed by the\nAccused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify and Smart Linkify fall within the scope of\n\u201cdocument[s]\u201d because \u201ctext can be entered into each type of document at issue.\u201d (C.A. No, 13-\n919 DI. 345 at 13-16) The editability requirement is satisfied, in Arendi\u2019s view, \u201cas long as at\nleast at one point in the past, it was a file into which text can be entered.\u201d (Tr. at 32)\n\nArendi\u2019s understanding of the claim scope is incorrect. The Court has construed\n\u201cdocument\u201d as \u201ca. . . file into which text can be entered,\u201d not a file into which text can be\nentered at some point. The \u201cdocument\u201d of the claim limitation must remain a \u201cdocument\u201d \u2014 that\nis, a \u201cfile into which text can be entered\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhile the document is being displayed.\u201d It must\nlikewise remain a \u201cdocument\u201d \u2014 again, a \u201cfile into which text can be entered\u201d \u2014 while the\nAccused App is \u201canalyzing . . . first information from the document.\u201d These limitations require\nthat the document remain editable at least when it is displayed and analyzed. Since there is no\ndispute that Linkify and Smart Linkify do not work on editable files, there is also no dispute that\nthe Accused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify and Smart Linkify do not satisfy these\n\nclaim limitations.\n\nArendi\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Arendi insists that the Court should\n\u201crecognize[] that .. . the characteristics of a claimed element can change over the course ofa\nclaim.\u201d (Id. at 32) Thus, according to Arendi, \u201cif a document begins as a file into which text can\nbe entered and then . .. becomes non-editable or read only, . . . that [does not] negate{] the fact\nthat it isa document.\u201d (Jd. at 31) By so arguing, Arendi essentially asks the Court to depart\nfrom its construction of a claim term and apply different meanings to the same term throughout a\nclaim based on the purported changes of \u201ccharacteristics of a claimed element.\u201d Arendi does not\ncite any authority to support this approach.\n\nIn a further attempt to support its position, Arendi refers to the opinion of its expert\nwitness, Dr. Smedley, who opines that a person of ordinary skill in the art (\u201cPOSA\u201d) \u201cwould\nunderstand the Court\u2019s construction to refer to classes of documents, as reflected by the Court\u2019s\nreference to a \u2018word processing, spreadsheet, or similar file\u201d and \u201cwould not dice this category\nfurther\u201d into editable or non-editable files \u201cat a given moment.\u201d (C.A. No. 13-919 D.L 347 Ex.\nB 4 163; see also id, D.I. 345 at 15) This portion of Dr. Smedley\u2019s opinion does not create a\ngenuine dispute of material fact as it only accounts for a part of the Court\u2019s construction ~ that\nthe \u201cdocument\u201d is \u201ca word processing, spreadsheet, or similar file\u201d \u2014 and ignores the part of the\nconstruction requiring a document to be a \u201cfile into which text can be entered.\u201d\n\nArendi also points to the Court\u2019s opinion in Arendi S.A.R.L. v. HTC Corp., 2020 WL\n7360155 (D. Del. Dec. 15, 2020). In that decision, the Court stated that, with respect to the \u00b0843\npatent, it no longer believed that the asserted claim \u201crequire{d] that the second information be\nused to perform an action in the first program.\u201d Id. at *2. In Arendi\u2019s view, that statement\nnegated the requirement that the \u201cdocument\u201d must remain editable and allow the user to insert\n\nthe \u201csecond information\u201d into the document. (See C.A. No. 13-919 D.I. 345 at 15-16; see also\n\n12\nTr. at 27-29) The Court disagrees. The Court\u2019s construction that \u201c[a] \u2018document\u2019 as used here\nmust be editable\u201d (C.A. No. 13-919 D.L. 143 at 8) is not predicated exclusively on the notion that\nthe user must be able to insert information back into the document after the analysis occurs.\nInstead, the Court explained that \u201cthe term \u2018document\u2019 must be construed consistent with the\npatents\u2019 repeated and consistent requirement in the specification that documents be editable,\u201d\nincluding that \u201cthe patent\u2019s definition of the term \u2014 \u2018word processors, spreadsheets, etc.\u2019 ~ is\nnecessarily limited to computer programs in which a user can enter data.\u201d (Id. at 8-9)\n\nIn sum, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the Accused Apps operating in\nconjunction with Linkify and Smart Linkify cannot infringe the \u2019843 patent. Accordingly,\nGoogle\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement will be granted with respect to the\nAccused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify and Smart Linkify.\n\nii. Chrome And News\n\nGoogle next contends that summary judgment of non-infringement should be granted\nwith respect to the Chrome and the News apps because \u201cArendi has no evidence to show the\nability of a user to edit Chrome and News webpages.\u201d (/d. D.I. 276 at 19-20)\n\nThere is a genuine dispute of material fact over whether a POSA would understand the\nitems displayed by Chrome and News to be files \u201cinto which text can be entered.\u201d With respect\nto Chrome, Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Smedley, provides multiple examples in his report in which the\ncontent of a webpage displayed by Chrome can be edited. (See id D.I. 347 Ex. A 72; Ex. B\n155, 160 n.108; see also id. D.1. 345 at 14-15) As to News, Dr. Smedley explained that \u201ctextual\ncontent of news articles is retrieved from a remote server and entered into a news item for\ndisplay.\u201d (id. D.I. 347 Ex. A { 102) In his opinion, then, the news item satisfies the editability\n\nrequirement because a POSA would understand the phrase \u201cinto which text can be entered\u201d to\n\n13\nrequire the \u201cability to load text into the objects that constitute the electronic document.\u201d (/d. Ex.\nB {f 153-54) Although Google contends that Dr. Smedley\u2019s opinion would \u201crender the Court\u2019s\nconstruction, \u2018into which text can be entered,\u2019 meaningless\u201d (id. D.I. 370 at 7), the Court\u2019s\nconstruction does not restrict the manner in which text can be entered into a document.\n\nThus, Dr. Smedley\u2019s opinion creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nChrome and News satisfy the \u201cdocument\u201d element. This portion of Google\u2019s motion will be\ndenied.\n\niii, | \u201cTransitory Data Entry Fields\u201d\n\nGoogle also contends that summary judgment of non-infringement is warranted with\nrespect to ten Accused Apps\u00ae and the Accused Devices using those apps because \u201cArendi\naccuses only transitory data entry fields . .. of being the \u2018document.\u201d\u201d (/d. D.I. 276 at 20) In\nGoogle\u2019s view, the transitory interfaces are not documents because \u201cthey are not \u2018word\nprocessor, spreadsheet or similar file[s].\u201d\u201d (Jd. at 21)\n\nThe Court will deny this portion of Google\u2019s motion. There is a genuine dispute of\nmaterial fact as to whether the data entry interfaces in the Accused Apps at issue in this motion\nare \u201cword processor, spreadsheet or similar files.\u201d Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Smedley, opines that a\nPOSA would understand that the data entry interfaces in each of the Accused Apps at issue are\n\u201cword processor, spreadsheet or similar files.\u201d (Jd, D.L. 345 at 17-21; see also, e.g., id. D.I. 347\nEx. B {ff 176-78)\n\nPointing to Arendi\u2019s statements trying to distinguish prior art during the prosecution and\n\nthe IPR proceeding of a related patent, Google counters that \u201cArendi and its experts repeatedly\n\n\u00a7 The ten Accused Apps are Google Messages, Chrome, Calendar, Contacts, Hangouts, Tasks,\nDocs, Slides, Sheets, and News. (C.A. No. 13-919 D.L. 276 at 20)\n\n14\n\nadmitted that user interfaces and data entry fields used merely to accept transitory text are not\n\u2018document\u2019 within the \u2019843 patent.\u201d ({d. D.1. 276 at 21) However, Dr. Smedley explains that\nthose statements are \u201cirrelevant\u201d to any of the data entry interfaces in the Accused Apps because\nthe purported \u201ctransitory data entry fields\u201d in the prior art \u201care not akin to the documents\u201d\nidentified in his expert reports. (/d. D.I. 345 at 21-23; see also id. D.I. 347 Ex. B {{ 167-69)\nThus, whether the transitory data entry fields in the Accused Apps constitute \u201cdocument[s]\u201d\npresents a genuine dispute of material fact to be resolved by the jury.\n\nb. \u201cDetermine If The First Information Is At Least One Of A\nPlurality Of Types Of Information That Can Be Searched For\u201d\n\nGoogle contends that the Court should grant summary judgment of non-infringement as\nto all Accused Products because none of the Accused Products \u201canalyze to determine whether\nidentified information is of a type that \u2018can be searched for\u2019 on a user\u2019s device.\u201d (/d. D.I. 276 at\n23) Arendi does not dispute Google\u2019s characterization of how the Accused Products operate.\n(See Tr. at 69) Instead, it argues that the Court\u2019s construction of this claim term does not require\nthe Accused Products to perform \u201can additional analyzing step\u201d to determine the searchability of\nthe first information. (C.A. No. 13-919 D.I. 345 at 25) For the reasons explained in connection\nwith the Court\u2019s grant of Arendi\u2019s Daubert motion to exclude portions of Dr. Rinard\u2019s opinions\nregarding this claim limitation (see supra II.A.2.a), the Court finds that the asserted claim does\nnot require that the searchability determination of the first information be made by the Accused\nProducts while performing this step of the claimed process,\u201d It follows that this portion of\n\nGoogle\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n\n9 Google also argues that Arendi\u2019s Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Mr. Hedloy, and its invalidity expert,\nDr. Sacerdoti, \u201cadmitted and acknowledged that there is a material difference between merely\ndetermining that information is of a particular type . . . and determining that the information is of\na type \u2018that can be searched for in an information source external to the document.\u201d (C.A. No.\n\n15\ne \u201cProviding An Input Device Configured By The First\nComputer Program\u201d And \u201cIn Consequence Of Receipt\nBy The First Computer Program Of The User Command\nFrom The Input Device!\u201d\n\nGoogle contends the Court.should grant summary judgment of non-infringement as to 12\nof the. 13 Accused Apps [MBN because: (1) the alleged \u201cfirst computer program\u201d\ndoes not \u201cset up the input device for use by the user\u201d (id. D.I. 276 at 34-39); and (2) the alleged\n\u201cfirst computer program\u201d does not \u201creceive, process and act on the user command from the\nalleged input device\u201d (id. at 39-40). With respect to the first issue, Google contends that the\n\u201cinput devices\u201d are iis\nS216 ot\n\nMBB, which is what Arendi identifies as the \u201cfirst computer program.\u201d (See id, at 34-35)\n\nGoogle explains that \u201c[t]he Android OS Framework code is separate from the code for each\n\nAccused pp;\nNN (12.0.1 370 215)\nWith respect to the second issue, Google argues that {jE . ..\n\ncro\n\nundisputedly does not receive, process or act on any user command from the \u2018input device\u201d and\n\n13-919 DJ. 276 at 24-26) The Court agrees with Arendi that Mr. Hedloy and Dr. Sacerdoti\u2019s\nstatements, at most, confirm that the information must belong to a category that \u201ccan be searched\nfor;\u201d these statements do not establish that the determination of whether the information \u201ccan be\nsearched for\u201d must be performed by the infringing products. (See id. D.I. 345 at 27-29)\n\n10 The Court construed the term \u201cproviding an input device configured by the first computer\nprogram\u201d as \u201cproviding an input device set up by the first computer program for use by the\nuser.\u201d Neither party asked the Court to construe the term \u201cin consequence of receipt by the first\ncomputer program of the user command from the input device.\u201d Relatedly, the Court also\nconstrued the term \u201ccomputer program\u201d as \u201ca self-contained set of instructions, as opposed to a\nroutine or library, intended to be executed on a computer so as to perform some task.\u201d (C.A. No.\n13-919 D.I. 143 at 11-12; id D.I. 144 at 1-2)\n\n16\nthat it is i , working with the Intent mechanism,\u201d that \u201creceives any\n\ncommand and processes that command to launch other programs.\u201d (Jd. D.I. 276 at 39)\n\nArendi responds that the [NNN that purportedly set up the \u201cinput devices\u201d are not\nI 2.3 hat the Accused Apps\nes. (2. 2.1.\n345 at 31-32) Arendi also argues that [II\n(02. 26 33) A rcnci\u2019s\n\nposition is supported by its expert, Dr. Smedley, who opines in his report that \u201c[o]ne of ordinary\nskill in-the art would understand a \u2018computer program\u2019 \u2014 consistent with the Court\u2019s construction\nand the specification of the patent \u2014 to include the methods and classes imported into and\ninvoked by the first computer program \u2014 regardless of whether those methods and classes are\ndefined in application-specific code or originate in shared libraries.\u201d (Jd. D.I. 347 Ex. B ff 97-\n109) In particular, with respect to the requirement that the \u201ccomputer program\u201d must be a \u201cset of\ninstructions\u201d that are \u201cself-contained,\u201d Dr. Smedley explains that [jin\na\nEE (12. 99) Based on what a \u201ccomputer program\u201d encompasses,\n\nDr. Smedley concludes that the Accused Apps \u201cprovide[] an input device responsive to a user\ncommand,\u201d and that \u201cthis component\u201d of the Accused Apps receives the user\u2019s command and\ninitiates a response. (See, \u00a2.g., id. Ex. A App\u2019x $f 28, 67, 90, 104, 136, 160, 185, 210, 231, 263,\n277)\n\nIn the Court\u2019s view, there is a. genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the \u201cfirst\n\ncomputer program\u201d [EN provides an \u201cinput device\u201d and receives the user\n\n17\ncommand from that \u201cinput device.\u201d The Court will, therefore, deny summary judgment of non-\ninfringement based on these claim limitations.\n\nGoogle insists that Arendi\u2019s infringement position \u201cdirectly contradicts its prosecution\narguments distinguishing prior art.\u201d (Jd. D.I. 370 at 18) In particular, Google contends that the\n\u201cseparateness\u201d between iii\nME \u2014 including the functionalities that purportedly set up the \u201cinput devices\u201d \u2014 is\n\u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to the architectures of several prior art systems which Arendi has attempted\nto distinguish during the prosecution and the IPR proceedings. (See id. D.I. 276 at 36) However,\nas Arendi explains, its earlier representations were made in the context of either a different\nconstruction of the claim term \u201ccomputer program\u201d or in connection with claim limitations not\npresent in the \u2019843 patent. (See id. D.I. 345 at 37-39) Arendi also denies that it ever represented\nthat the prior art systems identified by Google worked exactly as the ME in this action\ndo. (See, \u00a2.g., id. at 37, 38 nn.11, 12) At best for Google, this issue presents another genuine\ndispute of material fact, precluding summary judgment.\n\nIn sum, Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement will be granted\nwith respect to any Accused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify and Smart Linkify, and\nwill be denied with respect to-all other aspects.\n\n2. LG\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment Of\nNon-Infringement By The Rebel 4 Accused Products\n\nLG contends it is entitled to summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the\nRebel 4 Accused Products, focusing on specific functionalities and apps operating on these\nproducts: (1) Linkify (see C.A. No. 12-1595 D.I. 264 at 5-7); (2) Google apps (see id. at'7-8);\nand (3) the Smart Text Selector (\u201cSTS\u201d) functionality (see id. at 8-9). LG relies heavily on the\n\nopening brief filed in connection with Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-\n\n18\n\ninfringement and clarifies in its reply brief that it \u201cdoes not rely on evidence from the\nArendi/Google litigation, but the expected judgment of non-infringement regarding various\ninfringement theories in the Arendi/Google litigation.\u201d (Jd. D.I. 321 at 1) The Court\nunderstands that LG seeks summary judgment of non-infringement to the extent the Court grants\nGoogle\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement.\n\nArendi responds that LG\u2019s references to arguments and evidence not in the record of this\ncase cannot support summary judgment (see id, D.I. 299 at 5-7), and that LG\u2019s non-infringement\nargument ignores Arendi\u2019s evidence (see id. at 7-19).\n\nThe Court concludes that LG\u2019s reliance on the Google Action does not prevent the Court\nfrom granting LG\u2019s motion with respect to the Accused Apps operating in conjunction with the\nLinkify functionality. LG has cited the record in \u00a2his action to support the pending motion. For\nexample, LG relies on the reports of its expert, Dr. Rosing, to show that Linkify is a functionality\n\u201cprovided by Google as part of the Android operating system.\u201d (Id. D.I. 264 at 4; see also id.\nDI. 265 Ex. A ff 77, 78; Ex. B at 29-34, 45-51) LG also cites Dr. Rosing\u2019s report to prove that\n\u201c[t]here is no dispute that Linkify only runs in conjunction with non-editable Android text\n\u2018views\u2019 called by LG Email and LG Calendar.\u201d (Id. D.I. 264 at 4; see also id. D.1. 265 Ex. A ff]\n110-18, 171-78) During the consolidated hearing, Arendi also confirmed that there is no dispute\nthat the Linkify functionality only works in conjunction with files in non-editable mode. (See Tr.\nat 36)\n\nThus, under the Court\u2019s construction of \u201cdocument,\u201d there is no genuine dispute that the\nAccused LG and Google Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify cannot infringe the asserted\nclaims of the \u2019843 patent. Accordingly, consistent with the Court\u2019s finding and for the same\n\nreasons provided in connection with Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-\n\n19\ninfringement (see supra 1L.B.1), the Court will grant LG\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-\ninfringement with respect to the Accused LG and Google Apps operating in conjunction with\nLinkify on the Rebel 4 Accused Products.\n\nSince the Court is denying Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment in all other respects,\nit will also deny LG\u2019s motion in all other respects.\n\n3. BlackBerry\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment Of Non-Infringement\n\nBlackBerry has raised multiple grounds for summary judgment of non-infringement:\n\n(1) the Accused Applications are not \u201ccomputer program[s]\u201d (see C.A. No. 12-1597 D.1. 196 at\n\n5-7) (2) the \u201cinput device\u201d is not configured by the \u201cfirst computer program\u201d (see id. at 7-10);\n\nand (3) there is no evidence that BlackBerry or its customers have practiced the asserted method\n\nclaims (claims 1 and 8 of the \u2019843 patent) in the United States (see id. at 10-13), .\na. \u201cComputer Program\u201d\n\nThe Court construed the claim term \u201ccomputer program\u201d as \u201ca self-contained set of\ninstructions, as opposed to a routine or library, intended to be executed on a computer so as to\nperform some task.\u201d (Jd. D.I. 125 at 11-12) BlackBerry contends that \u201c[nJone of the Accused\nApplications are \u2018computer program{s]\u2019 as construed by the Court because all of the Accused\n\n. Applications rely on BlackBerry\u2019s Java SDK library that is external to the Accused Applications\nthemselves.\u201d (Jd, D.I, 196 at 5) In BlackBerry\u2019s view, \u201creliance on an outside program, API\n(\u201capplication programming interface\u201d], or library necessarily means that the first computer\nprogram is not \u2018self-contained,\u201d\u201d and, thus, the Accused Applications are not \u201ccomputer\nprogram[s].\u201d (Jd.)\n\nThe record reveals a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether a \u201ccomputer\n\nprogram,\u201d as construed by the Court, would be understood by a POSA as being able to rely on\n\n20\n\nexternal libraries. Although \u201ca routine or library\u201d cannot itself be a \u201ccomputer program,\u201d the\nCourt\u2019s claim construction is.silent on the issue of whether a \u201ccomputer program\u201d can rely on,\ninvoke, or incorporate a routine or library within its \u201cself-contained set of instructions.\u201d\n\nArendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Levi, opines that \u201cone of ordinary skill in the art would well\nunderstand computer programs (i.e., \u2018self-contained set[s] of instructions . . . intended to be\nexecuted on a computer so as to perform some task\u2019) incorporate numerous libraries and\nroutines.\u201d (/d. D.L. 197 Ex. O 24) Dr. Levi added during deposition that a computer program\ncan \u201ccontain\u201d an external library by \u201cinvok{ing] and incorporate[ing]\u201d it. (id. Ex. N at 39-40)\nThus, just because the Accused Applications rely on the Java SDK library that is external to the\nAccused Applications does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that these Accused Applications\nare not \u201ccomputer program[s]\u201d as construed by the Court.!!\n\nHence, the Court will deny this portion of BlackBerry\u2019s motion.\n\nb. \u201cInput Device\u201d Configured By The \u201cFirst Computer Program\u201d\n\nBlackBerry next contends it does not infringe any asserted claim of the \u2019843 patent\nbecause in all of the Accused Applications, the alleged \u201cinput devices\u201d are configured by\n\u201clibrary software external to the first computer program.\u201d (/d. D.I. 196 at 7-8) This contention\nis related to the parties\u2019 dispute over whether a \u201ccomputer program\u201d can incorporate and invoke\n\nexternal libraries, a material issue on which the Court has found a genuine dispute. There is,\n\n\\' BlackBerry contends that Arendi\u2019s own validity expert, Dr. Sacerdoti, admitted during his\ndeposition in the Google and the Motorola Actions that \u201capplications or other functionalities that\nare \u2018invoked\u2019 by the first computer system are not within the bounds of the first computer system\nitself.\u201d (C.A. No. 12-1597 D.I. 196 at 6-7) (citing id. D.I. 197 Ex. H at 180-82) Dr. Sacerdoti\u2019s\ndeposition testimony is ambiguous; he did not unequivocally say that \u201ca self-contained set of\ninstructions\u201d cannot invoke or incorporate external libraries. In any event, at most, Dr.\nSacerdoti\u2019s testimony shows the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact; it does not\nprovide a basis to grant BlackBerry summary judgment.\n\n21\nlikewise, a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the \u201cinput device\u201d is configured by the\n\u201cfirst computer program\u201d in the Accused Applications. (See, \u00a2.g., id, D.I. 233 at 6-7; id. DI. 235\nEx. A Jf 114-22, 127)\n\n\u00ab Infringement Of The Method Claims\n\nBlackBerry contends that summary judgment of no direct infringement is warranted with\nrespect to the asserted method claims (claims 1 and 8 of the 843 patent) because \u201cArendi has no\nevidence that BlackBerry performed each step of the claimed methods in the United States.\u201d (Id.\nD.I, 196 at 10) The Court disagrees,\n\nCiting BlackBerry\u2019s internal documents and user manuals, Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Levy,\nopines that \u201cBlackBerry has necessarily practiced the methods in claims | and 8 of the \u2019843\nPatent, including through, among other acts, product testing and trials performed to implement\ndesigns, ensure intended functionality, create user manuals, and/or generate marketing\nmaterials.\u201d (id. D.I. 197 Ex. A] 40 & nn.1, 2) Dr. Levy\u2019s expert opinion, together with the\ncontent of the documents and manuals he cited to, creates a genuine dispute over the material\nfact of whether Blackberry has practiced the methods of claims 1 and 8.\n\nWith respect to Blackberry\u2019s contention that \u201cArendi has absolutely no evidence that any\nmethod steps were performed by BlackBerry within the United States\u201d (ia. D.I. 196 at 11-12),\nthe Court agrees with Arendi that the email communications among BlackBerry employees\nregarding\nes \u2014 \u201cvould support a reasonable juror\u2019s conclusion\nthat BlackBerry practiced the claimed methods in the U.S. and is sufficient to create a genuine\nfactual dispute for trial.\u201d (Id. D.I. 233 at 17; see also id. D.1. 234 Ex. 6) Thus, the Court will\n\ndeny BlackBerry\u2019s motion for summary judgment of no direct infringement of claims 1 and 8.\n\nBlackBerry further contends that Arendi has not provided any evidence to show a\nrequisite underlying act of direct infringement of claims 1 and 8, as is required for it to prevail on\nits claims of indirect infringement. (See id. D.I. 196 at 12-13) Arendi neither responds to this\nchallenge nor points to any record evidence that could demonstrate an underlying act of direct\ninfringement by either BlackBerry\u2019s customers or anyone else. Thus, the Court will grant\nBlackBerry\u2019s motion for summary judgment of no indirect infringement of claims | and 8.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to claims\n23 and 30 will be denied because it is premised on the assumption that Arendi asserts these two\nclaims as method claims (see id. at 13), an assumption that Arendi rejects (see id. D.I. 233 at 17)\n\nTo summarize, BlackBerry\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement will be\ngranted with respect to indirect infringement of claims | and 8, and will be denied with respect to\nall other aspects.\n\n4. Motorola\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment Of Non-Infringement\n\nThe parties\u2019 briefs filed in connection with Motorola\u2019s motion for summary judgment of\nnon-infringement are highly similar to the briefs filed in the Google Action. The Court need not\nrepeat its reasoning to address the essentially identical issues here. For the same reasons\nprovided in connection with Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement (see\nsupra IL.B.1), the Court will grant Motorola\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-\ninfringement with respect to the Accused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify, and will\ndeny the motion with respect to all other aspects.\n\n5. Sony\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment Of Non-Infringement\n\nSony\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement presents two issues: (1) with\n\nrespect to the Accused Devices operating on Google\u2019s Android system, Sony contends it is\n\n23\nentitled to summary judgment of non-infringement \u201cto the extent the Court grants Google\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment of non-infringement\u201d (C.A. No. 12-1602 D.I. 232 at 3-7); (2) with\nrespect to the Accused Legacy Devices, Sony contends that Arendi\u2019s evidence of infringement is\nnot based (as it should be) on the source code underlying Sony\u2019s proprietary operating systems\nand apps (see id. at 8-12).\na. The Accused Android Devices\n\nArendi faults Sony for citing no evidence to support its motion and improperly relying on\nprotected information from the Google Action. (See id. D.I. 262 at 8-11) As the Court has\nexplained in the LG Action (see supra II.B.2), these purported problems will not prevent the\nCourt from granting Sony\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement \u201cto the extent\nthe Court grants Google\u2019s motion.\u201d Contrary to Arendi\u2019s contention, Sony has cited evidence in\nthe record of this action to support the pending motion. (See id. D.I. 282 at 3-4) For example,\nSony relies on portions of the report of Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Levy, to demonstrate that the\nfunctionality of Linkify \u201cis distributed with the Android framework and is then implemented\nwithin Sony\u2019s Accused Android devices.\u201d (Id. D.I. 232 at 3; see also id. D.I. 233 Ex. B \u00a5 16)\nSony also cites Dr. Levy\u2019s expert report and deposition testimony to prove that \u201cSony has neither\nchanged nor modified the relevant Android framework installed on Sony\u2019s Accused Android\nDevices.\u201d (Id. D.1. 232 at 5; see also id. D.I. 233 Ex. B fff 17-19; Ex. D ] 194; Ex. E at 76-77)\nIn light of Arendi\u2019s confirmation during the consolidated hearing that the Linkify functionality\nonly works in conjunction with non-editable files (see Tr. at 36), Sony need not rely on protected\ninformation from the Google Action to prove that the Accused Apps operating in conjunction\nwith Linkify cannot infringe the asserted claims of the \u2019843 patent. Accordingly, consistent with\n\nthe Court\u2019s finding and for the same reasons provided in connection with Google\u2019s motion for\n\n24\n\nsummary judgment of non-infringement (see supra II.B.1), the Court will grant Sony\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the Accused Apps operating in\nconjunction with Linkify on the Accused Android Devices.\nb. The Accused Legacy Devices\n\nSony contends that summary judgment of non-infringement should be granted with\nrespect to its Accused Legacy Devices because \u201cArendi has failed to meet its burden of proof.\u201d\n(C.A. No. 12-1602 D.I. 232 at 8) Specifically, Sony contends that \u201cArendi\u2019s infringement\ncontentions make no mention of or citation to the source code for the Accused Legacy Devices,\u201d\nand, instead, Arendi \u201conly offers speculation as to these devices\u2019 operation by relying on what is\nvisible on the screens or displays of the Accused Legacy Devices.\u201d (Id. at 8-10)\n\nArendi responds that, in this case, \u201cproof of infringement does not require source code.\u201d\n(Id, D.1. 262 at 31-32) Arendi points to Dr. Levy\u2019 expert report, in which he provides element-\nby-element explanations \u2014 relying on evidence generated by testing of the Accused Legacy\nDevices (but without source code analysis) \u2014 showing how, in his opinion, the Accused Legacy\nDevices do infringe the 843 patent. (See id. at 33-40; see also id. D.1. 233 Ex. D {J 98-130)\n\nThe Court concludes that Arendi has produced sufficient evidence to create a genuine\ndispute of material fact as to whether the Accused Legacy Products infringe the \u2019843 patent. For\nexample, in response to Sony\u2019s challenge that \u201canalysis of the source code is critical to determine\nwhich entities perform which functions\u201d (id. D.I. 232 at 11), Arendi points to Dr. Levy\u2019s expert\nreport, which explains how he relies on device testing evidence, including how \u201cthe input\ndevices are associated with and dependent on particular [user interface] elements of [the]\ncomputer programs,\u201d \u201cthe user must navigate to a link within a document displayed using the\n\nfirst computer program before [certain] menu items appear,\u201d and \u201cthe input devices are not\n\n25\navailable when an analogous document is displayed . . . using other computer programs,\u201d all\nshowing (in Dr. Levy\u2019s opinion) that the \u201cinput device\u201d is set up by the \u201cfirst computer\nprogram.\u201d (See id. D.1. 262 at 36-37; see also id. D.1. 233 Ex. D275) In the Court\u2019s view, a\nreasonable jury could credit Dr. Levy\u2019s testing-based analysis and conclude that it is the \u201cfirst\ncomputer program,\u201d rather than some other software program, that sets up the \u201cinput device.\u201d\n\nNone of the cases cited by Sony (see id. D.I. 232 at 9) supports the proposition that an\nexpert must review and analyze source code in order to opine on the issue of infringement in\nevery case involving software. Thus, this portion of Sony\u2019s motion will be denied.\n\nTo summarize, Sony\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement will be\ngranted with respect to the Accused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify, and will be\ndenied in all other aspects.\n\n6. Oath\u2019s Motion For Summary Judgment Of Non-Infringement\n\nOath\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement raises multiple issues: (1) with\nrespect to the Accused Apps operating on Google\u2019s Android system, Oath is entitled to summary ~\njudgment of non-infringement \u201cto the extent that the Court rules for Google . . . on [its motion]\n\nfor summary judgment of non-infringement\u201d (C.A. No. 13-920 D.I. 242 at 7);8 (2) Oath\u2019s\n\n'2 Sony\u2019s reliance on Dr. Levy\u2019s deposition testimony to demonstrate Dr. Levy\u2019s inability to\nprove infringement without a source code analysis fails to provide a meritorious basis for\nsummary judgment. (See C.A. No. 12-1602 D.I. 232 at 11) Dr. Levy testified that, in the\ncontext of the claim limitation \u201cproviding an input device configured by the first computer\nprogram,\u201d he would not know, without source code analysis, whether the code that performs that\nclaimed function is \u201cpart of the in-line code\u201d for the Accused Apps or is part of the operating\nsystem framework. (See id.) However, since the issue of whether the \u201cfirst computer program\u201d\ncan incorporate and invoke framework libraries presents a factual dispute, Dr. Levy\u2019s inability to\ntell whether the code is an Accused App\u2019s in-line code or is part of the operating system\nframework (which is invoked by the Accused App) does not compel the conclusion that he\ncannot prove infringement. (See id. D.I. 262 at 38)\n\n'3 With respect to Yahoo! Mail operating on Apple\u2019s iOS system, Oath requests that the Court\ngrant its motion to the extent that Court rules for Apple on Apple\u2019s motion for summary\n\n26\nAccused Apps do not directly infringe the computer readable medium (\u201cCRM\u201d) claim of the\n*843 patent (claim 23) (see id. at 11-14); and (3) Oath is entitled to summary judgment of no\nindirect infringement of claim 23 because Arendi\u2019s indirect infringement theory was disclosed\ntoo late and otherwise lacks evidentiary support (see id. at 14-16).!4\na. The Accused Apps Operating On The Android System\n\nArendi contends that Oath improperly relies on protected information from the Google\nAction and cites no evidence in the record of its own case to support its motion with respect to\nthe Accused Apps operating on Google\u2019s Android system. (See id. D.I. 277 at 8-10) As the\nCourt has explained in the LG and the Sony Actions (see supra II.B.2 and II.B.5.a), these issues\nwill not prevent the Court from granting Oath\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-\ninfringement \u201cto the extent the Court rules for Google.\u201d Oath has cited record evidence in this\naction to support the pending motion. (See id. D.I. 304 at 2-3) For example, Oath cites the\nreport of Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Smedley, to prove that \u201ccode relating to Linkify is defined in\nlibraries distributed with the Android framework\u201d (/d. D.I. 243 Ex. C { 12) and that \u201cAndroid\nfunctionalities must be the same across all Android devices, no matter the device manufacturer,\nto ensure compatibility and meet the Android Compatibility requirements.\u201d (Jd. D.I. 304 at 3;\nsee also id. D.J. 243 Ex. C J 15) In light of Arendi\u2019s confirmation during the consolidated\n\nhearing that the Linkify functionality only works in conjunction with non-editable files (see Tr.\n\njudgment of non-infringement. (See C.A. No. 13-920 D.I. 242 at 7) After the Apple Action\nsettled, the parties informed the Court that the release Arendi provided Apple also covers Oath\u2019s\nYahoo! Mail app running on the iOS system. (See id. D.I. 321) Thus, this portion of Oath\u2019s\nmotion is moot.\n\nM4 Gath also contends that it does not directly or indirectly infringe the method claim (claim 1) of\nthe \u2019843 patent. During the consolidated hearing, Arendi represented that it was not asserting\nclaim | against Oath. (See Tr. at 116) Thus, this portion of Oath\u2019s motion is moot.\n\n27\n\nat 36), Oath need not rely on the protected information from the Google Action to prove that the\nAccused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify cannot infringe the asserted claims of the\n*843 patent. Accordingly, consistent with the Court\u2019s finding and for the same reasons provided\nin connection with Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement (see supra\n1L.B.1), the Court will grant Oath\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement with\nrespect to the Accused Apps operating in conjunction with Linkify.\n\nb. Direct Infringement Of Claim 23\n\nOath contends it is entitled to summary judgment of no direct infringement of claim 23 of\nthe \u2019843 patent because Oath \u201cdoes not make, sell, or offer to sell either the hardware (i.e. the\nsmartphone) onto which the Accused Apps [are] downloaded or the underlying Android ...\nframework code required to form and execute the functionalities of the patented system of claim\n23.\u201d (C.A. No. 13-920 D.I. 242 at 11)\n\nClaim 23 of the \u2019843 patent is directed to \u201cat least one non-transitory computer readable\nmedium encoded with instructions which, when loaded on a computer,\u201d establish the process\nclaimed in the method claims. (\u2019843 patent at 12:40-42) A CRM claim is \u201ca claim to a computer\nreadable medium (e.g., a disk, hard drive, or other data storage device) containing program\ninstructions for a computer to perform a particular process.\u201d CyberSource Corp. v. Retail\nDecisions, Inc., 654 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2011). In this case, it is not clear what CRM\nArendi accuses Oath of infringing. Arendi repeatedly refers in its brief to \u201cOath\u2019s CRM,\u201d\n\nwithout clarifying what it means.'5 Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Smedley, opines in his expert report that\n\n'5 Regarding the question of what the accused CRM is, Arendi\u2019s counsel stated at the\nconsolidated hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t know how you have software without some kind of storage\ndevice. It has to be stored somewhere.\u201d (Tr. at 115)\n\n28\n\u201cfe]ach Accused Product is the requisite logic encoded on a non-transitory computer readable\nmedium, having been copied to the non-transitory memory of an Android computer from the\nnon-transitory memory of a server or \u2018master disk.\u2019\u201d (C.A. No. 13-920 D.I. 243 Ex. D 142) It\nappears, then, the accused CRM could be: (1) an Android computer\u2019s non-transitory memory;\nand/or (2) a server or \u201cmaster disk\u201d from which Oath\u2019s customers download the Accused Apps.\nUnder either theory, however, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Oath does not\ndirectly infringe claim 23 of the 843 patent.\n\nUnder the first theory, the Accused CRM is the memory of an Android computer. Arendi\noffers \u201cno evidence that Oath makes, uses, or sells\u201d any such CRM or any hardware (i.e.\nsmartphone, etc.) having such CRM \u201cwith the Accused Apps preloaded or onto which they may\nbe loaded.\u201d (id, D.I. 304 at 4) Thus, under this theory, no reasonable factfinder could find that\nOath directly infringes claim 23.\n\nUnder the second theory, the Accused CRM is the \u201cserver or \u2018master disk\u2019\u201d from which\nOath\u2019s customers download the Accused Apps. The Court agrees with Oath that there is no\ngenuine dispute of material fact that Oath\u2019s Accused Apps stored on the server or \u201cmaster disk,\u201d\nwhen loaded on a computer, do not meet the limitations of claim 23. Citing the deposition\ntestimony of Arendi\u2019s expert, Dr. Smedley, Oath correctly points out that \u201cwhen any of the\nAccused [Apps] are downloaded from the application store onto a smartphone, only the\nprogramming code specific to the Accused [Apps] is downloaded, not the underlying Android . .\n. framework code.\u201d (Id. D1. 242 at 12; see also id, D.1. 243 Ex. B at 101) Since Dr. Smedley\u2019s\ninfringement report only concerns the performance of the Accused Apps with the underlying\nAndroid framework, Arendi has provided no evidence that the instructions encoded by the\n\nAccused Apps alone, without the underlying operating system frameworks, can practice the\n\n29\n\nprocess claimed in claim 23 when they are loaded on a computer.!\u00ae Tt follows that there is no\ngenuine dispute of material fact that Oath does not infringe claim 23 under the second theory,\neither.'\u201d\n\nFor these reasons, Oath\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement will be\ngranted with respect to direct infringement of claim 23 of the \u2019843 patent.\n\nc. Indirect Infringement Of Claim 23\n\nThe Court will grant Oath\u2019s motion for summary judgment of no indirect infringement of\nclaim 23. Arendi failed to timely disclose its indirect infringement theory. (See id. D.I. 242 at\n14-16) It did not present its theory in its infringement contentions or expert report and only did\nso in its responsive summary judgment briefing. Relatedly, the record lacks sufficient evidence\nfrom which a reasonable factfinder could find that Oath induced or contributed to infringement\n\nof claim 23 of the \u00b0843 patent. (See id.)!\u00ae\n\n\\6 Nor does Arendi point to any evidence that the server or \u201cmaster disk\u201d has the source code for\nthe Android operating system framework.\n\n\"7 Arendi appears to argue that, under the second theory, the Accused Apps stored on the\nAccused CRM (server or \u201cmaster disk\u201d) can establish the claimed processes when they are\nloaded on an Android device. (See C.A. No. 13-920 D.I. 277 at 25-26) The CRM claim,\nhowever, requires that the software instructions establish the claimed processes when \u201cloaded on\na computer,\u201d not when loaded on a computer pre-installed with an Android operating system\nframework. The cases relied on by Arendi do not help it. For example, in Finjan, Inc. v. Secure\nComputing Corp., 626 F.3d 1197, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the Federal Circuit considered whether\ncertain software infringed the asserted CRM claims where the infringing software was \u201clocked\u201d\nwhen sold, requiring a customer to purchase a separate key to activate the software. The Federal\nCircuit explained that since \u201cit is undisputed that software for performing the claimed functions\nexisted in the products when sold,\u201d the \u201cfact that users needed to \u2018activate the functions\nprogrammed\u2019 by purchasing keys does not detract from or somehow nullify the existence of the\nclaimed structure in the accused software.\u201d Id. at 1205. Here, by contrast, it is undisputed that\nthe \u201csoftware for performing the claimed functions\u201d does not exist in the Accused Apps, because\nthe Accused Apps do not contain the underlying operating system frameworks required for the\nability to perform the claimed functions.\n\n18 \u201cTy order to succeed on claim of [induced infringement], the patentee must show, first that there\nhas been direct infringement, and second, that alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement\n\n30\nFor the foregoing reasons, Oath\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement\nwill be granted in full.\nWH. CONCLUSION\n\nAn appropriate order follows.\n\nand possessed specific intent to encourage another\u2019s infringement.\u201d MEMC Elec. Materials, Inc.\nvy. Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp., 420 F.3d 1369, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cTo establish contributory infringement, the patent owner must show... : 1) that\nthere is direct infringement, 2) that the accused infringer had knowledge of the patent, 3) that the\ncomponent has no substantial noninfringing uses, and 4) that the component is a material part of\nthe invention.\u201d Fujitsu Ltd. v. Netgear Inc., 620 F.3d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\n\n31\n"}
