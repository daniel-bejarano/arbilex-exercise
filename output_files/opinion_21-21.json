McGr iff (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), a  pretrial detainee at the James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center  Institution , filed this action  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  (D.I. 2).  Plaintiff  \nappears pro se and has been granted leave t o proceed in forma pauperis.  (D.I. 5).  Plaintiff filed a  \nSecond  Amended Complaint on A ugust 10, 2021 and it is the operative pleading.  (D.I. 18).  He \nrequests counsel.  (D.I. 19).  This Court proceeds to screen the Second Amended Complaint  \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(a).   \nI. BACKGROUND \n On July 9, 2021, this Court screened the amended complaint, dismissed Defendants City \nof Wilmington (\u201cthe City\u201d) and the Wilmington Police Department (\u201cWPD \u201d) and allowed Plaintiff \nto proceed with his claims against Defendants Mary Quinn (\u201cQuinn\u201d) , Lawrence Matic (\u201cMatic) , \nand Officer DeBarnaventure (\u201cDeBarnaventure\u201d) .  (See D.I. 15, 16).  Plaintiff was given leave to \nfile a Second Amended Complaint .  (Id. at 16).  The Second Amended Complaint reinstates the \nCity and the WPD  and adds new Defendants Lt. Paul Ciber  (\u201cCiber\u201d)  and the WPD Office of \nProfessional Standards  (\u201cOffice of Professional Standards\u201d) .  (See D.I. 18 at 1).    \n Plaintiff was arrested on May 19, 2020.  (D.I. 11 at 6-7).  As discussed in this Court\u2019s \nJuly 9, 2021 Memorandum, Plaintiff  alleged that following his arrest Quinn, Matic, and \nDeBarnaventure failed to preserve evidence that is in \u201chis favor\u201d  and knowingly and intentionally \nconspired to deprive him of his constitutionally protected freedom.  (D.I. 15).  As alleged in the \nfirst amended complaint, Plaintiff  again alleges that  the City and WPD failed to train their officers \non the procedures to preserve evidence and knowingly presented  false information to obtain \nprobable cause with the intent of Plaintiff\u2019s false arrest, false imprisonment,  and violation of due \nprocess .  (D.I. 18 at 7).  He all eges that Ciber and the Office of Professional Standards  failed to 2 investigate  Plaintiff\u2019s claims with the intent to deprive due process and conduct an adequate \ninvestigation and committed mail fraud when he sent Plaintiff a letter that was intended to dec eive \nPlaintiff that there was an inves tigation of Plaintiff\u2019s police mis conduct claims .  (Id. at 8).  Plaintiff \nalso alleges that  Ciber and the Officer of Professional Standards conspired to violate Plaintiff\u2019s \nconstitutional rights.   (Id.).   \n Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.  ( Id. at 10).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malici ous, fails to state \na claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is \nimmune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks \nredress from a governmental defendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions).  The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the  light most favorable to a pro se  plaintiff.  See Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d \n224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because Plaintiff proceeds \npro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his  Second Amended Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson , 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).  \nA complaint is not automatic ally frivolous  because it fails to state a claim.   See Dooley v. \nWetzel , 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020)  (quoting Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989) ); \nsee also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002).  \u201c Rather, a claim  is \nfrivolous only where it depends \u2018 on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory \u201d or a \u201c clearly baseless \u201d 3 or \u201cfantastic or delusional \u201d factual scenario. \u2019\u201d  Dooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell \nv. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327- 28).  \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure  to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions.  See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 \n(3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim \nunder \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)).  B efore dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon \nwhic h relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, \nthis Court , however, must grant P laintiff leave to amend h is complaint unless amendment would \nbe inequitable or futile.  See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at  114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007) .  Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint \nmust do more than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d  Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.  See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC , 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (cit ing Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \nand Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim \nhas substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may \nnot be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See \nid. at 10.   4 Under the pleading regime established by Twombly  and Iqbal , a court reviewing the \nsufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the  elements the plaintiff must \nplead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are \nnot entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations,  \nassume their veracity and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  See Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) ; see also  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a  \u201ccontext -\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d  Id.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n Like the amended complaint, t he conspiracy claim s in the Second Amended Complaint  are \ndeficiently pled as  conclusory not support by facts.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (stating that a \ncomplaint will not suffice if it \u201coffers [merely] \u2018labels and conclusions \u2019\u201d or \u2018\u201c naked assertion [s]\u2019 \ndevoid of \u2018further factual enhancement\u2019\u201d) (quoting Twomb ly, 550 U.S. at 555, 557).  The Second \nAmended Complaint mak es bare conclusory statement s of conspiracy and they are insufficient to \nstate a claim.   Therefore, the claim s will be dismissed.  \nPlaintiff  reinstates the failure to train claim against the C ity and the WPD.  It fails for the \nsame reasons as outlined in this Courts July 9, 2021 memorandum .  The failure to train claim lacks \nfacts and does not contain the elements required to state a claim.  Therefore, it will be dismissed.  \nFinally, Plaintiff raises failure to investigate claims against Ciber and the Office of \nProfessional Standards.   The clai ms against Ciber and the Office of  Professional Standards are \nconclusory.  The Second Amended Complaint does not explain when, where , or how the \ninvestigation of Plaintiff\u2019s complaints of police misconduct was or was not  conducted, other than 5 to refer to a n undated letter described by Plaintiff as intending to deceive him.  Therefore, the \nfailure to investigate claims will be dismissed.   \nLiberally construing the allegations  as this Court must, Plaintiff has alleged what appear to \nbe cognizable and non -frivo lous failure to preserve evidence claims against Quinn, Matic, and \nDeBarnaventure.  As to the dismissed claims, this Court finds further amendment futile.  \nIV. REQUEST FOR COUNSE L \n Plaintiff requests counsel on the grounds that he cannot afford counsel, the issues a re \ncomplex, he has limited law library access, he has sought an attorney without success, and he has \nlimited knowledge of the law.  (D.I. 19) .  A pro se  litigant proceedin g in forma pauperis  has no \nconstitutional or statutory right to representation by counsel.1  See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d \n187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace , 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).  R epresentation by \ncounsel , however, may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a finding that a plaintiff \u2019s \nclaim has arguable merit in fact and law.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.  \n After passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of factors when \nassessing a request for counsel.  Factors to be considered by a court in deciding whether to request \na lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the merits of the plaintiff \u2019s claim; (2) the \nplaintiff \u2019s ability to present his or her case considering his or her educati on, literacy, experience, \nand the restraints placed upon him or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; \n(4) the degree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff \u2019s ability to pursue such \ninvestigation; (5) the plaint iff\u2019s capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and (6) the \n \n1   See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989) \n(\u00a7 1915(d)  (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling \nattorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being \u201crequest.\u201d).  6 degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.  See Montgomery \nv. Pinchak , 294 F.3d 492, 498- 99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155- 56.  The list is  not \nexhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.   \n Assuming, solely for the purpose of deciding this motion, that Plaintiff \u2019s claims have merit \nin fact and law, several of the Tabron factors militate against granting his reque st for counsel.  To \ndate, the filings demonstrate Plaintiff\u2019s ability to articulate his claims and represent himself.  In addition, the issues are not complex.  F or these reasons, this Court will deny Plaintiff \u2019s request for \ncounsel without prejudice to re new.     \nV. CONCLUSION \n For the above reasons, the C ourt will (1) dismiss  the conspiracy , failure to train , and failure \nto investigate  claims pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and (i i) and 1915A(b)( 1) and allow \nPlaintiff to proceed against Quinn, Matic, and DeBonaventure ; and (2) deny without prejudice \nPlaintiff\u2019s request for counsel (D.I. 19).  Amendment is futile as to the dismissed claims  and those \nclaims are dismissed with  prejudi ce.   \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.  "}
