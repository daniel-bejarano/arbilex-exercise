Aliahmed\n\naka Evonca Sakinah S. Aliahmed\naka Kelly E. Sakinah\n\naka David Allen Allemandi,\n\nPetitioner,\nv. : Civil Action No. 20-1225-LPS\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n1. BACKGROUND\n\nOn April 10, 2014, Petitioner pled guilty to second degree rape and continuous sexual abuse\nof a child (as the lesser included offenses of first degree tape). See Winter v. May, 2020 WL 6743063,\nat *1 (D. Del. Nov. 17, 2020). The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as follows: (1) for the\ncontinuous sexual abuse of a child conviction, twenty-five years of Level V incarceration (with credit\nfor 216 days previously served), suspended after five years for twenty years of Level III probation,\nand (2) for the second degree rape conviction, twenty-five years at Level V, suspended after fifteen\nyeats and successful completion of the Transitions Sex Offender Program for one year of Level IV\nconfinement, followed by eight years of Level III probation. See id. Petitioner did not appeal her\nconvictions or sentences.\n\nIn 2017, Petitioner filed a petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. See\n\nid. The Coutt denied the petition in its entirety after determining that one claim lacked metit and\n\nthe remaining two claims were procedurally barred from federal habeas review. See id, at *3-9.\nPetitioner did not appeal that decision to the Third Circuit.\n\nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner\u2019s new petition for federal habeas telief\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d).\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal district court may summatily dismiss a habeas petition \u201cif it plainly appeats from\nthe face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d\nRule 4, 28 U.S.C. fol. \u00a7 2254. A district court can entertain a habeas petition \u201cin behalf of a person\nin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in\nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States,\u201d and only if the relief sought is\neither immediate release or speedier release. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973).\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\n\u2018The actual form petition filed by Petitioner does not contain any grounds challenging the\nlegality of her custody, and only states that she seeks \u201crelease from prison.\u201d (D1. 1 at 15) Inan\n\u201cAffidavit\u201d attached to the petition, Petitioner asserts general complaints about the conditions of her\nconfinement, concetns about her ill mother, and her own medical concerns. (D.I. 1-1 at 1) These\ncomplaints do not present issues cognizable on federal habeas review, and are more propertly\nasserted via 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (although they may also lack merit under that statute as well). Given\nthe number of \u00a7 1983 cases Petitioner has filed in this Coutt,' it would appear that Petitioner is\nawate of the proper method for raising the instant issues. Accordingly, the Court will summarily\n\ndismiss the instant Petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018See, e.g, Aliabmed v. Mears, Civ. A. No. 21-219-LPS; Sakinah v. Carney, Civ. A. No. 20-1195-LPS.\n2\n\nI\ni\n1\n|\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition. The\nCourt will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner has failed to make a\n\u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir.\n\nLAR. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order will be\n\nentered,\nWilmington, Delaware HONORABLE LEONARD P.
