Procedural History\n\nPlaintiff protectively filed a claim for SSI on January 30, 2018, alleging disability as of\nNovember 18, 2013 due to bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder,\nhigh blood pressure, asthma, arthritis in both knees and legs, back and shoulder pain, and\neczema. (D.I. 9 at 85-86, 192) Plaintiff's claims were denied initially in June 2018 and upon\nreconsideration in April 2019. (/d. at 84, 105) At Plaintiffs request, an administrative law judge\n(\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on June 1, 2020. (/d. at 43-59) The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision\non June 12, 2020, finding that Plaintiff was capable of a limited range of light work. (/d. at 21-\n34) The Appeals Council subsequently denied Plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision the final decision of the Commissioner. (Jd. at 7-9)\n\nPlaintiff brought this civil action on June 7, 2021. (D.I. 2) Plaintiff filed the pending\nmotion for summary judgment on November 5, 2021 (D.I. 12), and the Commissioner cross-\nmoved for summary judgment on December 2, 2021 (D.I. 14). Briefing is now complete on the\npending motions.\n\nB. Medical History\n\nPlaintiff was 33 years old when she filed her application for SSI benefits on January 30,\n2018. (D.L. 9 at 33) The ALJ found that Plaintiff had the following severe impairments:\ncervicalgia, lower back pain, obesity, bipolar disorder, and an intellectual disability. (Jd. at 23)\nThe court focuses its summary of the medical evidence on the records relevant to Plaintiff's\n\nmental impairments, which are the subject of Plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n\\\n\n1. Medical evidence\nIn March 2016, Plaintiff was voluntarily admitted to Rockford Center for treatment of\nher mental health issues. (D.I. 9 at 353) Despite her history of mental health treatment, she had\nrecently stopped taking her medications, causing her to experience increased feelings of anger\nand anxiety. (/d.) Plaintiff followed up with outpatient mental health treatment at Connections\nCommunity Support Programs (\u201cConnections\u201d). (Jd. at 446-50)\n\nDuring the relevant time period between 2018 and 2020,* Plaintiff treated with three\nproviders at Connections. Nancy Cleary, PMH CNS, performed medication checks and\nconsistently reported that Plaintiff was compliant with her medication. (D.I. 9 at 615, 690, 866)\nPlaintiff routinely reported feeling depressed, overwhelmed, and frustrated, but she stated that\nher medications helped her stay balanced. (/d, at 617, 622, 691, 844, 851, 866)\n\nPlaintiff also attended therapy sessions at Connections with Rashanah Peterson,\nMS/HCA, OL, between 2018 and 2020. Ms. Peterson\u2019s treatment notes describe the sources of\nPlaintiffs stress and anxiety to include family conflict and the completion of paperwork\npertaining to her Social Security case, but Plaintiff consistently demonstrated mental stability\nand compliance with her medications. (D.I. 9 at 625-29, 637) Social worker Jay Cantor, LCSW,\nalso met with Plaintiff from 2019 to 2020. His records are consistent with Ms. Peterson\u2019s\n\ntreatment notes, indicating that Plaintiff exhibited some mild depressive symptoms and was often\n\n4 The relevant period for Plaintiff's SSI claim begins with her January 30, 2018 application date\nthrough the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision on June 12, 2020. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.202(g) (claimant\nis eligible for SSI benefits when an application for SSI benefits is filed); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.203(b)\n(\u201c[Y]ou cannot become eligible for payment of SSI benefits until the month after the month in\nwhich you first become eligible for SSI benefits.\u201d); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.501 (\u201cPayment of benefits\nmay not be made for any period that precedes the first month following the date on which an\napplication is filed[.]\u201d); see also Azbell v. Saul, 2020 WL 2392444, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 24,\n2020) (explaining that \u201capplicants are ineligible for [SSI] benefits until the month after applying\nfor benefits.\u201d).\noverwhelmed due to family conflict, but her overall mood was stable. (/d. at 696-97, 825, 847,\n854-55, 862-63) In April 2019, Plaintiff told Mr. Cantor that she intended to start her own\nbusiness. (/d. at 824) Throughout the summer of 2019, Plaintiff reported to Ms. Peterson that\nher basket-making business was doing well, she was mentally stable, and she remained\ncompliant with her medications. (Jd. at 826, 828)\n\n2. Medical opinions\n\nBrian Simon, Psy.D completed a psychological functional capacity evaluation during a\nconsultative examination in June 2018 to assess Plaintiff's functional limitations for disability\ndetermination purposes. (D.I. 9 at 523-29) Dr. Simon confirmed that Plaintiff suffered from\nmild depressive symptoms but could not validate her diagnoses of bipolar disorder, anxiety, or\npost-traumatic stress disorder. (Jd. at 528-29) On the psychological functional capacity\nevaluation form, Dr. Simon indicated Plaintiff had moderate limitations in her ability to relate to\nother people, maintain her personal habits, carry out instructions, sustain work performance, and\ncope with the pressures of ordinary work and mild restrictions on her activities of daily living.\n(Id. at 523-24) He further opined that Plaintiff had mild limitations in her ability to understand\nsimple instructions, carry out activities of daily living, and perform routine tasks. (/d.)\n\nIn his narrative description of the consultative evaluation, however, Dr. Simon explained\nthat Plaintiff did not have difficulty getting along with others, she had no problems maintaining\nconcentration or understanding and following simple instructions, and she could independently\nperform activities of daily living such as managing her finances and completing household\nchores. (Jd. at 528) Dr. Simon concluded that Plaintiff was capable of making decisions and\nexercising judgment, insight, and common sense in a work setting, although he anticipated she\n\nmay experience some problems adapting to different circumstances and persisting for a normal\nwork period due to her mental impairments. (/d.)\n\nOn August 22, 2018, Ms. Peterson completed a psychological functional capacity\nevaluation regarding Plaintiff's bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. (D.I. 9 at 595-\n97) Ms. Peterson identified severe impairments in Plaintiff's ability to sustain work performance\nand attendance, cope with pressures of ordinary work, and perform routine, repetitive tasks. (Jd.\nat 597) Ms. Peterson also explained that Plaintiff had moderate to severe impairments in her\nability to relate to other people and understand and carry out simple instructions. (Jd. at 596)\nFor these reasons, Ms. Peterson opined that Plaintiff would be unable to perform simple,\nrepetitive, full-time work. (Jd. at 595)\n\nThe following week, Ms. Cleary completed the same psychological functional capacity\nevaluation for Plaintiff, opining that Plaintiff was unable to perform full-time work due to her\nracing thoughts, poor impulse control, disorganization, and irritated mood. (D.I. 9 at 600) Ms.\nCleary identified moderate to severe impairments in Plaintiff's ability to relate to other people,\nperform activities of daily living, understand simple instructions, and perform routine, repetitive\ntasks. (Jd. at 601-02) Ms. Cleary also identified severe impairments in Plaintiff's ability to carry\nout instructions, sustain work performance and attendance, and cope with the pressures of\nordinary work. (/d. at 602)\n\nPlaintiff underwent an additional psychological evaluation with Jolyn A. Pinamonti,\nPsy.D in January 2020 at the request of her attorney. (D.I. 9 at 796) Dr. Pinamonti administered\nvarious diagnostic tests that revealed Plaintiff's cognitive ability was in the extremely low range,\nas was her ability to sustain attention. (/d. at 800) Testing also revealed a severe level of\ndepression and anxiety, and Plaintiff met the diagnostic criteria for chronic post-traumatic stress\n\ndisorder. (Id. at 801) However, Plaintiff did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar\ndisorder. (/d.)\n\nMr. Cantor completed a psychological functional capacity evaluation for Plaintiff in\nMarch 2020. (D.I. 9 at 870-72) Mr. Cantor explained that Plaintiff was not able to remain on\ntask for at least 80% of a typical workday due to her depression, anxiety, mood swings, and\ndifficulty concentrating. (/d. at 870) He estimated that Plaintiff had a moderately severe\nlimitation in her ability to sustain work performance and cope with the pressures of ordinary\nwork, moderate limitations in her ability to understand simple instructions and perform routine,\nrepetitive tasks, and a mild limitation in her ability to carry out instructions. (/d. at 872)\n\nThe same month, Ms. Cleary completed another psychological functional capacity\nevaluation for Plaintiff that showed improvement as compared with the evaluation she completed\nin 2018. (DI. 9 at 873-75) Ms. Cleary identified only moderate limitations in Plaintiff's ability\nto understand and carry out simple instructions and perform routine tasks. (Jd. at 875)\nNonetheless, Ms. Cleary maintained her opinion that Plaintiff was unable to perform full-time\nwork due to Plaintiff's difficulty focusing and the ease with which Plaintiff became frustrated\nand overwhelmed. (/d. at 873)\n\n3. State agency assessments\n\nState agency physician Shelley Ross, Ph.D, evaluated Plaintiff's medical records and\nrendered a mental residual functional capacity assessment on June 13, 2018. (D.I. 9 at 99-102)\nDr. Ross opined that Plaintiff had no significant limitations in her ability to understand and carry\nout simple instructions, but she was moderately limited in her ability to sustain an ordinary\nroutine, maintain regular attendance, work in proximity to others, and maintain attention and\n\nconcentration for extended periods. (Jd. at 99-100)\nIn April 2019, State agency physician Carlene Tucker-Okine, Ph.D, affirmed the opinion\nof Dr. Ross based on her review of the evidence in Plaintiff's file. (DI. 9 at 107) Dr. Tucker-\nOkine observed that Plaintiff responded well to her medication, which \u201chelps her stay balanced,\u201d\nand her mood was fairly stable with only mild signs of depression and anxiety. (/d.) Dr. Tucker-\nOkine confirmed that Plaintiff was able to handle simple, routine tasks. (/d.)\n\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n\n1. Plaintiff? Testimony\n\nDuring the hearing before the ALJ on June 1, 2020, Plaintiff testified that she had\nprevious work experience as a teacher\u2019s aide in a daycare. (D.I. 9 at 53-54) In that role, she\nassisted the teacher with meal preparation, lesson plans, and activities for about twelve infants.\n(Id. at 54) Her position involved a lot of walking and lifting children. (/d.) The ALJ inquired\nabout a note in the treatment records from Plaintiff's therapist indicating that Plaintiff's business\nwas doing well. (/d. at 55) Plaintiff testified that she had made baskets as a hobby, and she\nmade business cards pertaining to her basket-making activity, but she did not make money from\nthese activities. (Id. at 52, 55)\n\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing in June 2020, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical to\nvocational expert (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\nPlease assume a hypothetical individual the same age, education and work\n\nexperience as the claimant who can perform light [sic]. Climb ramps and stairs,\n\nladders, ropes, and scaffolds. Frequently balance. Occasionally stoop, kneel,\n\ncrouch, crawl. Occasional exposure to extreme cold, heat, wetness, humidity,\n\nvibration, sunlight, fumes, odors, dust, gas, moving dangerous machinery or\n\nunprotected heights. Can perform unskilled work with a reasoning level of 1 or 2.\n\nNo piece work, no assembly line work. Occasional changes in the work setting,\n\ndecision making, interaction with coworkers that requires no teamwork or tandem\n\ntasks and occasional interaction with the public. Could this person perform the\nclaimant\u2019s past work?\n(D.I. 9 at 57) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a hypothetical\nindividual would not be able to perform Plaintiff past work as a daycare teacher\u2019s aide. (Id.)\nHowever, the VE indicated that such a hypothetical individual could work as a table worker,\ninserter of safety goods, or garment bagger. (/d. at 57-58)\n\nThe ALJ then asked the VE whether the hypothetical individual would be able to\nmaintain employment if she lacked concentration and focus to such a degree as to be off task\nfifteen percent or more of the workday. (/d. at 58) The VE responded that such a hypothetical\nindividual would not be able to participate in competitive employment. (/d.)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the medical evidence in the record and the testimony by Plaintiff and the VE,\nthe ALJ determined that Plaintiff was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period\nfrom the January 30, 2018 application date through the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision. (D.I. 9 at 21-\n34) The ALJ found, in pertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 30,\n2018, the application date (20 CFR 416.971 et seq.).\n\n2. The claimant has the following severe impairments: cervicalgia, lower back\npain, obesity, bipolar disorder, and an intellectual disability (20 CFR\n416.920(c)).\n\n3. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 416.920(d), 416.925 and\n416.926).\n\n4. After careful consideration of the entire record, I find that the claimant has the\nresidual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR\n416.967(b) except the claimant can occasionally climb ramps, stairs, ladders,\nropes, and scaffolds; can frequently balance; and, can occasionally stoop,\nkneel, crouch, and crawl. The claimant can have occasional exposure to\nextreme cold, extreme heat, wetness, humidity, sunlight, vibrations, fumes,\nodors, dust, gases, poor ventilation, hazards such as moving machinery and\nunprotected heights. The claimant can perform unskilled work, reasoning\nlevel one (1) or (2), involving no piece work, no assembly line work,\noccasional changes in work setting, occasional decision making, occasional\ninteraction with coworkers with no teamwork or tandem tasks, and occasional\ninteraction with the public.\n\n5. The claimant is unable to perform any past relevant work (20 CFR 416.965).\n\n6. The claimant ... was 33 years old, which is defined as a younger individual\nage 18-49, on the date the application was filed (20 CFR 416.963).\n\n7. The claimant has a limited education and is able to communicate in English\n(20 CFR 416.964).\n\n8. Transferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability\nbecause using the Medical-Vocational Rules as a framework supports a\nfinding that the claimant is \u201cnot disabled,\u201d whether or not the claimant has\ntransferable job skills (See SSR 82-41 and 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P,\nAppendix 2).\n9. Considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual\nfunctional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\nnational economy that the claimant can perform (20 CFR 416.969 and\n416.969(a)).\n10. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, since January 30, 2018, the date the application was filed (20 CFR\n416.920(g)).\nM11. 9 at 23-34)\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\nevidence supports the decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1148,\n1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a reasonable mind\nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 839 F.\nApp\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\n\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\n\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle XVI of the Social Security Act provides for the payment of disability benefits to\nindigent persons under the SSI program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a). A disability is defined for\npurposes of SSI as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any\nmedically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death\nor which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12\nmonths.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe\nthat they preclude a return to previous work or engagement in any other kind of substantial\ngainful work existing in the national economy. Jd. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540\nUSS. 20, 21-22 (2003).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir. 1999). If\nthe Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the sequential\nprocess, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i). At\nstep one, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in any substantial\ngainful activity. See id. If the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity, step two\nrequires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is suffering from a severe\n\nimpairment or a severe combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n\n10\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. When a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is presumed disabled. See\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii). Ifa claimant\u2019s impairment, either singly or in combination, fails\nto meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\n416.920(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186\nF.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do despite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak\nv. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal\nquotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating the inability\nto return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other words, the\nCommissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age,\neducation, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\n\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\n11\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n\nPlaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to properly assess the consistency and supportability\nof the medical opinion evidence regarding her mental impairments. (D.I. 13 at 8-18) According\nto Plaintiff, the ALJ\u2019s inadequate evaluation of these medical opinions led to a deficient RFC\nassessment, and remand is therefore required. (Jd.) For the following reasons, the court\nconcludes that the ALJ\u2019s assessments of the opinions of Plaintiffs treating providers,\nconsultative examiner Dr. Simon, and the State agency physicians were supported by substantial\nevidence.\n\n1. Assessment of opinion evidence from treating providers\n\nPlaintiff contends that the ALJ erred in finding the opinions proffered by Ms. Peterson,\nMs. Cleary, and Mr. Cantor unpersuasive because these opinions were consistent with each other\nand were supported by the providers\u2019 underlying treatment records. (D.I. 13 at 9-11, 15-16)\nBecause the opinions of Plaintiff's treating providers support greater limitations than those\nincluded in the ALJ\u2019s RFC, Plaintiff contends that the error is not harmless, and remand is\nrequired. (Id. at 8-9, 17)\n\nIn accordance with the revised regulatory framework for claims filed on or after March\n27, 2017, the ALJ is not required to give any \u201cspecific evidentiary weight, including controlling\nweight, to any medical opinion(s) . . . , including from a medical source.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n416.920c(a). Instead, the ALJ must consider the persuasiveness of all medical opinions based on\nthe application of five factors: (1) supportability; (2) consistency; (3) relationship with the\nclaimant; (4) specialization; and (5) other factors. Id. at \u00a7 416.920c(a)-(c). The ALJ must\nexplain how he considered the most important factors of supportability and consistency. Id. at \u00a7\n\n416.920c(b)(2). \u201cConsistency concerns the degree to which the opinion reflects the same\n\n12\nlimitations described in evidence from other sources, whereas supportability concerns the\nrelevancy of objective medical evidence and degree of explanation given by the medical source\nto support the limitations assessed in the opinion.\u201d Eader v. Saul, 2020 WL 10898140, at *3\n(MLD. Pa. Nov. 20, 2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nHere, the ALJ acknowledged that Ms. Cleary, Ms. Peterson, and Mr. Cantor, \u201cissued\nopinions overall consistent with one another,\u201d but he found that those opinions were not\nsupported by their own treatment notes. (D.I. 9 at 30) In support of this finding, the ALJ\nobserved that \u201c(t]he claimant has consistently reported her medication regimen has controlled her\nsymptoms, and she has displayed no issues or difficulties attending appointments as scheduled or\ntaking her medications as prescribed.\u201d (/d.)\n\nWhile the underlying records confirm that Plaintiff was receptive to treatment and\nbenefited from her medications, the ALJ did not acknowledge treatment records from Ms. Cleary\nidentifying lapses in Plaintiff's medication regimen. In March 2019, Ms. Cleary diagnosed\nPlaintiff with \u201cNonadherence to Medical Treatment,\u201d explaining that Plaintiff reported taking her\nmedications consistently despite the fact that she \u201cshould have run out of meds\u201d by that time.\n(D.L 9 at 710) Again in August 2019, Ms. Cleary noted that Plaintiff ran out of medication and\n\u201chas been stretching meds.\u201d (Id. at 843-44) Ms. Cleary\u2019s notes indicate that when Plaintiff ran\nout of medication, she felt \u201cdiscombobulated.\u201d (/d. at 615) In this regard, the ALJ\u2019s assessment\nthat the treatment records showed \u201cno issues or difficulties . . . taking her medications as\nprescribed\u201d is inaccurate. (/d. at 30)\n\nMore critically, the ALJ concluded that the opinions of Ms. Cleary, Ms. Peterson, and\nMr. Cantor were unpersuasive based on his finding that their treatment notes showed Plaintiff\n\n\u201chas not displayed limited attention, concentration, or ability to complete tasks presented to her.\u201d\n\n13\n(D.L 9 at 30) This assessment is not supported by Plaintiff's treatment records. Ms. Cleary\nroutinely reported that Plaintiff exhibited rambling speech and racing thoughts, and she often felt\noverwhelmed and frustrated. (/d. at 617, 622, 691, 844, 851, 866) These aspects of Ms. Cleary\u2019s\ntreatment records support her opinion that Plaintiff's racing thoughts, and the ease with which\nshe became frustrated and overwhelmed, would prevent Plaintiff from working full-time. (/d. at\n600-02, 873-75)\n\nMs. Peterson\u2019s treatment notes from 2018 establish that Plaintiff often required Ms.\nPeterson\u2019s assistance in completing and transmitting paperwork. (D.I. 9 at 625, 629) At least\ntwice, Plaintiff dropped in without a scheduled appointment to seek Ms. Peterson\u2019s help in\ncompleting paperwork. (Jd. at 631, 633) On these occasions, Ms. Peterson observed Plaintiff's\nagitation, heightened anxiety, and frustration. (/d.) These records support Ms. Peterson\u2019s\nopinion that Plaintiff would be limited in her ability to sustain work performance, cope with the\npressures of ordinary work, understand and carry out simple instructions, and perform routine,\nrepetitive tasks. (Id. at 596-97)\n\nIn April 2019, Mr. Cantor described Plaintiff's mood as \u201clabile,\u201d and his treatment notes\nfrom December 2019 indicated that Plaintiff \u201cis active in many areas of her life; but needs help\nfocusing on her many daily tasks.\u201d (/d. at 825, 854) In January 2020, he reported that Plaintiff\nexhibited \u201chyper verbal, rambling speech, struggling to stay focused.\u201d (Jd. at 863) These\nportions of Mr. Cantor\u2019s records support his opinion that Plaintiff would have difficulty\nremaining on task throughout the workday due to her mood swings and difficulty concentrating.\n(Id. at 870)\n\nBecause the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Plaintiffs treatment records is factually inaccurate,\n\nthe ALJ\u2019s justification for finding the opinions of Ms. Cleary, Ms. Peterson, and Mr. Cantor\n\n14\nunpersuasive under the supportability factor is flawed. See Andrews v. Kijakazi, 2022 WL\n617118, at *8 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 2, 2022) (concluding that ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by\nsubstantial evidence where his reasons for finding medical opinion persuasive were factually\ninaccurate). For this reason, the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and\nremand is required for reconsideration of the supportability factor as it pertains to the opinions of\nMs. Cleary, Ms. Peterson, and Mr. Cantor. See Gamret v. Colvin, 994 F. Supp. 2d 695, 698\n(W.D. Pa. 2014) (\u201cEven if enough evidence exists in the record to support the decision, [the\ncourt] cannot uphold it if the reasons given by the trier of fact do not build an accurate and\nlogical bridge between the evidence and the result.\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted)).\n2. Assessment of evidence from consultative examiner\n\nPlaintiff correctly contends that the ALJ erred by failing to address Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion\nthat Plaintiff \u201cmay encounter some problems . . . being able to persist for a normal work period\nbecause of her psychiatric problems.\u201d (D.I. 9 at 528; D.I. 13 at 12-13) The ALJ acknowledged\nDr. Simon\u2019s opinion that Plaintiff had \u201cmoderate limitations . . . sustaining work performance\u201d\nand found Dr. Simon\u2019s opinions persuasive. (D.I. 9 at 29) Nonetheless, the ALJ did not account\nfor any limitations on Plaintiff's ability to complete a normal work period in his RFC\nassessment. (Id. at 27) The ALJ\u2019s failure to account for the limitation in his RFC assessment or\nelsewhere in his opinion prevents the court from ascertaining whether the ALJ did not credit this\nportion of the opinion or simply ignored it. See Burnett v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 220 F.3d\n112, 121 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nPlaintiff's second argument regarding Dr. Simon\u2019s alleged failure to review Plaintiff's\n\nmedical records is not supported by the record. (D.I. 13 at 13) Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion expressly\n\n15\nacknowledges that he received Plaintiff's medical records along with her referral note. (D.I. 9 at\n526) Because the ALJ will be required to reassess the opinions of Dr. Simon and Plaintiff's\ntreating providers on remand, the court need not reach Plaintiff's argument regarding the level of\npersuasion accorded to each of the opinions. (D.I. 13 at 13) Similarly, Plaintiff's third argument\nregarding the alleged stability of Plaintiff's mental health symptoms during the relevant period\nmay be impacted by the ALJ\u2019s reconsideration of portions of the record on remand in accordance\nwith the court\u2019s rulings at \u00a7\u00a7 III.B.1 and 2.\n3. Assessment of State agency administrative findings\n\nPlaintiff argues that the ALJ erred in crediting the reports of two non-examining State\nagency psychologists over the opinions of her treating providers. (D.I. 13 at 14-15) In\nparticular, Plaintiff challenges the ALJ\u2019s representation that the State agency psychological\nconsultants possess \u201ca comprehensive understanding of agency rules and regulations.\u201d (/d.; D.I.\n9 at 32) But this was not the only\u2014or even the primary\u2014factor considered by the ALJ in\ndetermining that the opinions of the State agency consultants were persuasive. The ALJ also\nfocused on the State agency consultants\u2019 thorough review of the available medical record, the\nopinions\u2019 internal consistency, and the fact that the opinions were \u201cwell supported by a\nreasonable explanation and the available evidence at the time of their determinations, including .\n. . the rather stable, benign findings on mental status examinations on a stable medication\nregimen throughout the relevant period.\u201d (D.I. 9 at 32) Thus, the ALJ did not err by also noting\nthat the State agency consultants possess \u201ca comprehensive understanding of agency rules and\n\nregulations.\u201d (Id.)\n\n16\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment (D.I. 12) is\nGRANTED, and the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 14) is DENIED.\nThis matter shall be remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the ALJ shall reevaluate the\nsupportability factor as it pertains to the opinions of Ms. Cleary, Ms. Peterson, and Mr. Cantor,\nand shall address Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion that Plaintiff had moderate limitations in sustaining work\n\nperformance. An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nDated: September 30, 2022\n\nistrate Judge\n\n17\n"}
