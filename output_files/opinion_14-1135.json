WILLIAM KUSCHEL \nDefendant. \nDaniel M. Silver, Shannon D. Humiston, Alexandra M. Joyce, MCCARTER & \nENGLISH, LLP, Wilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Plaintiff \nZi-Xiang Shen, Kenneth L. Wan, STA TE OF DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF \nJUSTICE, Wilmington, Delaware \nCounsel for Defendant \nAugust 24, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION COLMF.LLY \nCHIEF JUDGE \nPending before me is Defendant William Kuschel' s Renewed Motion for \nJudgment as a Matter of Law and to Alter or Amend Judgment , or in the \nAlternative, for a New Trial. D.I. 217. When the events that gave rise to this \naction occurred, Kuschel was a correctional officer and Plaintiff De Shawn \nDrumgo was a prisoner at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (Vaughn) in \nDelaware. Drumgo sued Kuschel under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violating Drumgo's \nEighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment during a routine \nfrisk search at the prison. D.I. 191 at 5. \nAfter a two-day trial, a jury found that Drumgo \"prove[ d] that William \nKuschel committed an act that violated Mr. Drumgo' s Eighth Amendment rights\" \nbut did not \"prove that he suffered any injuries as a result of' that act. D.I. 211 at \n1. Consistent with the explicit directions on the verdict sheet, the jury therefore \nawarded Drumgo nominal damages of $1. D .I. 211 at 1. The jury also awarded \nDrumgo punitive damages of $500,000. D.I. 211 at 2. \nKuschel advances two principal arguments in support of his motion. He \nargues first that I should grant him a new trial and vacate the judgment against him \nbecause I erroneously admitted at trial the testimony of Marvin Burroughs . He \nargues in the alternative that I should reduce or vacate the punitive damages award. I. THETRIAL \nDrumgo presented five witnesses at trial-himself and four fellow inmates \nfrom Vaughn. Drumgo testified that during a routine frisk search performed on \nhim after he exited Vaughn's dining hall on May 29, 2014, Kuschel grabbed and \nheld onto Drumgo's genitals, causing him physical injuries and long-term mental \ndistress. Tr. 110:18-111:9, 128:15-130:24. According to Drumgo, Kuschel \n\"touch[ed]\" and then \"wouldn't let go\" ofDrumgo's penis, causing it to \"rupture\" \nand suffer \"a cut that opened up.\" Tr. 111:1-2, 9, 12. Drumgo testified that when \nhe yelled at Kuschel to \"let go\" of his genitals, the other correctional officers in the \narea heard the commotion and \"just laughed.\" Tr. 112:7. \nInmate Isiah Walker testified that on May 29 he \"happened to look over and \n... [saw] Sergeant Kuschel moving his leg, moving his hands up Drumgo' s leg, \nand that's when Drumgo said, you know, you're touching my private parts and \nsuch, and that's when the situation happened.\" Tr. 211 :3-7. Walker was then \nasked-without objection from defense counsel-\"Did you see him grab and \nsqueeze Mr. Drumgo's groin?\" to which Walker responded: \"Yes.\" Tr. 211 :8-9.1 \n1 I expressed numerous times at trial my concerns about leading questions posed to \nthe witnesses in this case. See, e.g., Tr. 220: 16-222:3 (\"This is a case about \ncredibility and you have an ethical obligation, attorneys do, not to vouch. We need \nto be very careful about that and you need to be very careful about leading \nquestions. So, you know, the way that direct went was you asked a couple of \nquestions to that witness. He did not say [\"]let go,[\"] and then you say, [\"]did he \nsay [']let go,[?\"'] and then he said [\"]yes,[\"] and then you [get] the words [\"let \n2 [Kuschel] was doing to [Drumgo], but he was-I know he was in his inner thigh \nand that's when Drumgo was like, [']get off my [genitals.']\" Tr. 330:20-23. \nInmate Curtis Mercer testified that he also saw Kuschel frisk search Drumgo \non May 29. Tr. 342:3-6. But when asked to describe what he saw, Mercer \nexplained that he did not see Drumgo until after he \"heard the reaction of Drumgo \nsnapp[ing]\" at Kuschel, at which point he \"turned around\" and saw Drumgo with \n\"this shocked look.\" Tr. 342:21-23. Mercer did not testify that he heard officers \nlaughing. \nA final inmate, Marvin Burroughs, testified that Kuschel groped his genitals \nduring three frisk searches conducted in the fall of 2013. Tr. 225:10-226:8, 227:4-\n24. \nKuschel testified along with five other defense witnesses at trial. Kuschel \ndenied that he assaulted Drumgo, Burroughs, or any other inmate during his years \nas a correctional officer. Tr. 250:25-251 :5. He also testified that an internal \ninvestigation by Vaughn into Drumgo' s allegations had \"cleared [him] of all \nwrongdoing.\" Tr. 250:22-24. \nA former correctional officer, Paul Abernathy, testified that he had worked \nwith Kuschel at Vaughn, that he had no recollection of Kuschel ever sexually \nassaulting an inmate, and that he would have recalled any occasion where a fellow \ncorrectional officer \"violently grabb[ed] an inmate's genitals during a search.\" Tr. \n4 276:14-19. Correctional Officers Franchot Wallace, Sheryl VanGorder, and Jason \nSchaffer testified that they had observed Kuschel perform searches at Vaughn and \nthat they had never \"perceive[d] any issues with how Mr. Kuschel performed frisk \nsearches.\" Tr. 260:21-261:1, 286:13-18, 353:20-25. \nCorrectional Officer Stanley Baynard testified that he conducted Vaughn's \ninternal investigation that cleared Kuschel of Drumgo' s sexual assault allegation. \nTr. 290:14-293:16. Baynard acknowledged that as many as 20 to 25 inmates and \nat least two other correctional officers besides Kuschel witnessed the incident, but \nthat he interviewed only Drumgo and Kuschel for his investigation. Tr. 308:10-\n309:23. He also testified that the cameras in the area in which Kuschel's search of \nDrumgo occurred were not set up to record and only allowed for live monitoring. \nTr. 315:5-316:5. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Rule 50(b) \n\"If the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made \nunder Rule 50(a), ... the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a \nmatter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under \nRule 59.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). A motion filed under Rule 50(b) \"should be \ngranted only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant \nand giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is \n5 insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.\" Lightning \nLube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). \nB. Rule 59( a) \nPursuant to Rule 59(a), \"[t]he court may, on motion, grant a new trial on all \nor some of the issues-and to any party-... after a jury trial, for any reason for \nwhich a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal \ncourt .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a). One ground for a new trial is the erroneous \nadmission of evidence that resulted in manifest injustice. See Montgomery Ward \n& Co. v. Duncan, 311 U.S. 243, 251 (1940) (holding that a motion for a new trial \n\"may raise questions of law arising out of alleged substantial errors in admission or \nrejection of evidence.\"). If the court concludes that a challenged evidentiary ruling \nwas in fact erroneous, it must \"grant a new trial unless it was 'highly probable' that \nthe error did not affect any 'substantial rights.\"' Bhaya v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 922 F.2d 184, 189 (3d Cir. 1990) (quoting McQueeny v. Wilmington Trust \nCo., 779 F.2d 916, 928 (3d Cir.1985)). \"The decision to grant or deny a new trial \nis confided almost entirely to the discretion of the district court.\" Blancha v. \nRaymarklndus., 912 F.2d 507,512 (3d Cir. 1992). \nC. Rule 59( e) \nRule 59(e) permits a party to file \"a motion to alter or amend a judgment.\" \n\"A proper motion to alter or amend judgment must rely on one of three major \n6 grounds: (1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of new \nevidence not available previously; or (3) the need to correct clear error of law or \nprevent manifest injustice.\" N River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reinsurance Co., 52 F.3d \n1194, 1218 (3d Cir. 1995) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets \nomitted). \nID. DISCUSSION \nA. The Admission of Burroughs's Testimony at Trial \nI admitted Burroughs's testimony over Kuschel's objections pursuant to \nRule 415, which permits a court to \"admit evidence that the party committed any \nother sexual assault ... [i]n a civil case involving a claim for relief based on a \nparty's alleged sexual assault.\" Fed. R. Evid. 415. The Third Circuit's \napproach to the admissibility of past acts involving \nsexual assault [ under Rule 415] is set out in Johnson v. \nElk Lake School District, 283 F.3d 138 (3d Cir. 2002). \nFirst, the trial court must decide \"whether a reasonable \njury could find by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe past act was an 'offense of sexual assault' under Rule \n413 ( d)' s definition and that it was committed by the \ndefendant.\" Id. at 154-55. Then, the trial court \"may \nstill exclude [ the evidence] under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 403\" if \"its probative value is substantially \noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion \nof the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations \nof undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of \ncumulative evidence.\" Id. at 155 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. \n403 ). That balancing test should place \"a thumb on the \nscale in favor of admissibility\" if the past act is \n\"demonstrated with specificity\" and \"is sufficiently \nsimilar to the type of sexual assault allegedly committed \n7 by the defendant.\" Id. at 155-56. Otherwise, there is no \npresumption of admissibility. Id. at 156. In any case, \neven in this context \"the Rule 403 balancing inquiry is, at \nits core, an essentially discretionary one that gives the \ntrial court significant latitude to exclude evidence.\" Id. \nBernard v. E. Stroudsburg Univ., 700 F. App'x 159, 168 (3d Cir. 2017) (second \nalteration in the original). \nKuschel argues that I committed legal error because I allowed Burroughs to \ntestify at trial without \"hear[ing] Burroughs' [ s] testimony prior to trial to determine \n( 1) whether his allegations constituted sexual assault under Rule 413 and (2) \nwhether his allegations were 'substantially similar' to Plaintiff's claims.\" D .I. 218 \nat 4; see also D.I. 218 at 7 (arguing that the Court made an \"error of law in \nadmitting Burroughs[' s] testimony without making predicate findings as required \nby FRE 415\"). This argument fails for two reasons. \nFirst, Kuschel waived the argument. Before trial, Drumgo' s counsel stated \nin a letter filed with the Court that Drumgo intended to call Burroughs as a witness \nat trial and that Burroughs would testify that he was \"subjected to frisk searches \nthat were performed by the Defendant\" and that \"during a frisk search performed \nby [Kuschel]\" within one year of Kuschel' s alleged assault of Drumgo, Kuschel \n\"grabbed and squeezed [Burroughs's] groin in the same manner alleged by \n[Drumgo].\" D.I. 205 at 1; see also D.I. 205 at 2 (\"Mr. Burroughs will testify that \nDefendant grabbed and squeezed his groin -in the same manner at issue in this \n8 case -which would constitute an offense of sexual assault under Rule 413.\"); D.I. \n205 at 3 (\"Both [Drumgo] and Mr. B[u]rroughs are inmates at the James T. \nVaughn Correctional Center, both were subjected to frisk searches after exiting the \ndining hall that were performed by [Kuschel], and both inmates had their groin \ngrabbed and squeezed by [Kuschel] in an inappropriate and sexual manner. These \nevents occurred less than a year apart.\"). During the ensuing oral argument on the \nI \nadmissibility of Burroughs's testimony, the following exchange occurred: \n[Counsel]: ... [T]he Court has to make a determination \nthat, you know, the proposed testimony is that it's the \nsame conduct. You know, there's a clear sexual assault \nthat happened and I just don't think we have that \nbecause all we have is plaintiffs word that, oh, this is \nwhat Mr. Burroughs would testify to, but it's -\nTHE COURT: Well, we can get a proffer from Mr. \nBurroughs to take care of that. I mean, is that a proffer \nfrom Mr. Burroughs as opposed to the defendant? \nDoes that take care of it? \n[Counsel]: No, Your Honor. \nTr. 19:22-20:7 (emphasis added). Notably, Kuschel's counsel never again argued \nor suggested in any way that it was necessary for me to hear in limine directly from \nBurroughs the substance of his testimony to decide if the acts Burroughs attributed \nto Kuschel constituted sexual assault under Rule 413. Nor did Kuschel' s counsel \never argue or suggest in any way that I needed to hear in limine directly from \nBurroughs to decide if Burroughs's allegations were \"substantially similar\" to the \n9 acts Drumgo accused Kuschel of. See D.I. 226 at 2 (\"Defendant acknowledges \nthat at the time of trial, he did not view a 'proffer' from Burroughs as sufficient to \naddress his concerns and that he did not re-assert a specific objection at the time of \nBurroughs'[s] testimony.\"). For that reason, I focused on whether Kuschel was \nunfairly prejudiced by the admission of Burroughs's testimony under Rule 403; \nand, because his counsel never articulated a basis for a finding of unfair prejudice2 \n2 Kuschel's counsel stated that \"allowing a plaintiff to just parade in front of the \njury a line of witnesses to accuse defendant of sexual assault is extremely \nprejudicial in light of the social stigma of being labeled or seen as a sexual \npredator.\" Tr. 18:12-16. But Congress made the decision when it enacted Rules \n413-15 to allow defendants accused of sexual assault to suffer this form of \nprejudice. That decision was, and remains, controversial; and it is clearly at odds \nwith Rule 404(b ), which prohibits the use of \"any other crime, wrong, or act ... to \nprove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person \nacted in accordance with the character.\" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(l). As the Third \nCircuit noted in Johnson: \nEver since their initial proposal, Rules 413-15 have been met with \nhostility by the legal establishment. See Judicial Conference of the \nU.S., Report of the Judicial Conference on the Admission of \nCharacter Evidence in Certain Sexual Misconduct Cases, 159 F.R.D. \n51, 52 (1995) [hereinafter Judicial Conference Report] (observing the \nopposition of an \"overwhelming majority of judges, lawyers, law \nprofessors, and legal organizations\" to the proposed rules); \nChristopher B. Mueller & Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Evidence Under the \nRules 475 (3d ed.1996) (noting that \"the professional reaction to \n[Rules 413-15] has been strongly negative\"). Although Congress \nbypassed the ordinary rulemaking procedures when adopting Rules \n413-15, the enacting legislation provided the Judicial Conference 150 \ndays within which to make and submit alternative recommendations \non the rules to Congress. The Judicial Conference's Advisory \nCommittee on Evidence Rules, with what it noted was \"highly \nunusual unanimity,\" ardently opposed the new rules, fearing that they \n10 or stated or suggested in any way that the admission of Burroughs's testimony \nwould confuse the issues, mislead the jury, cause undue delay, waste time, or \npresent cumulative evidence, I made the discretionary call to admit the testimony. \nSee Tr. 18:7-31:15; see also Fed. R. Evid. 403 (\"The court may exclude relevant \nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or \nmore of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, \nundue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\"). \n\"could diminish significantly the protections that have safeguarded \npersons accused in criminal cases and parties in civil cases against \nundue prejudice.\" Judicial Conference Report, 159 F.R.D. at 53. \nEmbracing the views of the Advisory Committee, the Conference \nrecommended that Congress \"reconsider its policy determinations \nunderlying Evidence Rules 413-415\" or, in the alternative, adopt \namendments to Rules 404 and 405 proposed by the Advisory \nCommittee. Id. at 54. Congress rejected both alternatives, and the \nrules stand today as originally enacted. \n283 F.3d at 151 (brackets in the original). \nPrecisely because I think Rule 415 is fundamentally flawed, I implored \nKuschel' s counsel to state on the record how Kuschel was unfairly prejudiced by \nallowing Burroughs to testify at trial. See, e.g., Tr. 29: 14-22 (\"[T]his is why I \nopened up by asking what's your prejudice. For instance, you didn't say, well, \nthey never disclosed ... Burroughs, and we litigated the case, we took discovery \nand we didn't follow up [on Burroughs's alleged assault], and therefore even if \nthey met [Rule 415(b)'s] 15-day [disclosure] requirement, we're still prejudiced \nbecause we never had a chance to look to see if there w[ as] any video evidence to \nrebut [Burroughs] or find out who was on duty or if you don't know the date of the \nassault, right?); Tr. 30:7-11 (\"You have to articulate, well, what is the unfair \nprejudice? That's why I asked, was Burroughs disclosed in initial disclosures, and \nyou're not putting anything on the record. I mean, now you're starting to, but you \nhave to kind of come in and say what is the prejudice.\"). \n11 Having failed to take up my offer to hear directly from Burroughs in limine and \nhaving failed to renew any objection during Burroughs's testimony at trial, \nKuschel waived the ability to argue now that I should have heard Burroughs in \nlimine before admitting his testimony under Rule 415. See Orexo AB v. Actavis \nElizabeth LLC, 424 F. Supp. 3d 371,382 (D. Del. 2019) (\"Having failed to raise \nbefore or during trial that the ... analysis I employed in granting Actavis' s motion \nin limine needed to be redone in light of [ subsequent developments in] the case, \nOrexo cannot now raise that issue in a Rule 59 motion.\").3 \n3 Kuschel also argues for the first time in his brief filed in support of his motion \nthat Burroughs's testimony at trial differed \"substantively\" from the proffer of the \ntestimony given by Drumgo' s counsel. D .I. 218 at 5. This argument also was \nwaived, as Kuschel failed to lodge an objection to Burroughs's testimony at trial. \nBut in any event, the differences between Burrough' s trial testimony and the \nproffer are not material. Kuschel complains that Burroughs said at trial that \nKuschel \"groped\" his genitals whereas Drumgo' s counsel proffered that Burroughs \nwould testify that Kuschel \"grabbed and squeezed\" his genitals. This seems to me \na distinction without a difference. D .I. 218 at 5. And given that the jury found \nKuschel liable for an Eighth Amendment violation but rejected Drumgo's \ntestimony that his genitals were ruptured by Kuschel' s grabbing and squeezing, it \nappears that Burroughs's testimony-which is identical to Lopez's testimony\u00ad\nmay have benefitted Kuschel. \nKuschel also takes issue with the fact that Burroughs testified that Kuschel \ngroped him on three occasions whereas Drumgo's counsel's proffer seemed to \nsuggest that Burroughs would testify that Kuschel assaulted Burroughs only once. \nThe proffer, however, was more ambiguous that Kuschel allows. Drumgo's \ncounsel said that Burroughs and Drumgo were both \"subjected to frisk searche\u00a7.\" \n(plural), D.I. 205 at 1, and although counsel stated that Burroughs would testify \nthat he was assaulted during a search that occurred within a year ofKuschel's \nassault of Drumgo, the proffer did not exclude the possibility that Burroughs was \ngroped during the other routine searches Kuschel performed on Burroughs. In any \n12 Second, nothing in Johnson or Bernard suggests in any way that a court \ncannot admit testimony under Rule 415 unless it has first heard that testimony from \nthe witness outside the presence of the jury. On the contrary, the Court held in \nJohnson that although district courts \"might find\" an in limine hearing to be \nhelpful, \"an in limine hearing is not required ... for considering the admission of \nevidence proffered under Rule 415.\" 283 F.3d at 157 n.16 (emphasis added); \naccord United States v. Abrams, 761 F. App'x 670,676 (9th Cir. 2019) (holding \nthat \"an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury is not required\" to \nadmit evidence under Rule 413 and that \"the threshold preponderancy requirement \nfor admission of prior-bad-acts evidence [ under Rule 413] can be based on \nevidence proffered by the government other than live witness testimony\"). In this \ncase, especially since Kuschel' s counsel had declined my invitation to obtain a \nproffer directly from Burroughs, I did not think an evidentiary hearing would prove \nuseful. Burroughs's account of Kuschel' s acts proffered by Drumgo' s counsel was \nvirtually identical to Drumgo' s assault claim. Both men alleged that Kuschel frisk \nsearched them when they left Vaughn's dining hall and both men alleged that \nKuschel fondled their genitals when he searched them. Thus, Burroughs's \nevent, given the fleeting nature of the searches, I do not think the fact that \nBurroughs testified at trial that he was groped three times as opposed to one time \nwas significant. \n13 allegations were substantially similar to Drumgo' s claims. Moreover, Kuschel' s \ncounsel never suggested-and still does not contend-that nonconsensual groping \nof a person's genitals does not constitute sexual assault under Rule 413. See Fed. \nR. Evid. 413(d)(2) (defining \"sexual assault\" to \"mean[] a crime under federal law \nor under state law ... involving ... contact, without consent, between any part of \nthe defendant's body ... and another person's genitals\"). In addition, nothing was \nsaid during oral argument to suggest that Burroughs would give testimony at trial \nmaterially different from the proffer given by Drumgo' s counsel. Thus, the proffer \nprovided a basis on which to conclude that a jury could reasonably find by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Kuschel sexually assaulted Burroughs in \nsubstantially the same way that Drumgo alleged Kuschel assaulted him. For these \nreasons, as noted above, I focused on the question of whether Kuschel was unfairly \nprejudiced by the admission of the testimony such that it might be barred by Rule \n403. Kuschel has not identified, and I do not see, any legal error in my Rule 403 \ncalculus, and therefore I will deny his request for a new trial. \nB. The Punitive Damages Award \nKuschel argues that the jury's award of $500,000 in punitive damages \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and must be \nvacated or reduced as a matter of law. D .I. 218 at 7. Alternatively, he asks that I \n14 exercise the discretion afforded me by Rule 59 and remit the award as unsupported \nby the evidence and excessive. D.I. 218 at 7. \n\"The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the \nimposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.\" State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408,416 (2003). In the usual case \nwhere a party challenges a punitive damages award on due process grounds, the \ncourt is required \"to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of \nthe defendant's misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm \nsuffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference \nbetween the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties \nauthorized or imposed in comparable cases.\" Id. at 418. In this case, Kuschel does \nnot dispute that the conduct for which the jury found him liable is reprehensible, \nand, for reasons that escape me, his counsel did not expressly address in their \nbriefing the degree of the reprehensibility of Kuschel' s conduct. 4 That leaves for \n4 Kuschel' s counsel, who are employed by the Delaware Attorney General's \nOffice, state in their reply brief that \"[c]onsidering the factual circumstances of the \ncase and the legal authorities governing claims of repeated sexual assault by \ncorrectional officers, Defendant determined that an argument that the \nreprehensibility prong is not met would be inappropriate.\" D.I. 226 at 3 n.l. But \nState Farm's first guidepost calls on courts to assess the degree of reprehensibility. \nThis is not a binary test that is either met or not met. Although all sexual assaults \nare reprehensible, there are degrees of sexual assault; and the assault in this case\u00ad\nfleeting, through clothing, unaccompanied by threats, and lacking in force \nsufficient to cause injury-is very much on the low end of the spectrum of sexual \n15 consideration the second and third guideposts; but because this case involves a \nnominal damages award, the analyses for these factors are the same, and under \nThird Circuit precedent I am to rely principally on comparisons to punitive awards \nin similar cases to determine if the jury's punitive award here was \nunconstitutionally excessive. See Jester v. Hutt, 937 F.3d 233, 242 (3d Cir. 2019).5 \nOf all the comparative cases cited by the parties, only two, Cleveland v. \nCuny, 2014 WL 690846, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2014) and Shepherdv. Fischer, \n2018 WL 3122053, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2018) involved sexual assaults \ncommitted by correctional officers during clothed-body searches of inmates. The \ncorrectional officer's conduct in Curry was very similar to Kuschel' s actions here. \nThe jury in Curry found the officer liable under the Eighth Amendment and\u00a7 1983 \nfor \"squeez[ing] and grabb[ing]\" five inmates' genitals \"in the course of \nconducting clothed-body searches on them between 2006 and 2008.\" 2014 WL \nassaults. As noted, the jury explicitly rejected Drumgo' s testimony that he was \ninjured by Kuschel's behavior. \n5 With respect to the second guidepost, \"[t]he Supreme Court has ... cautioned ... \n'that in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and \ncompensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\"' CGB \nOccupational Therapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs., Inc., 499 F.3d 184, 190, 192 (3d \nCir. 2007) (quoting State Farm, 538 U.S. at 425). But \"the single-digit ratio \nanalysis does not apply to punitive awards accompanying nominal damages \nawards.\" Jester, 937 F.3d at 242. Rather, for nominal damages cases, the Third \nCircuit has directed district courts to rely on \"comparisons to punitive awards in \nsimilar cases [to] help [them] assess the reasonableness of a punitive award[.]\" Id. \n16 690846, at * 1. The jury awarded $2,000 in compensatory damages to three of the \ninmates, $5,000 in compensatory damages to the fourth inmate, and $10,000 in \ncompensatory damages to the fifth inmate. Id. It also awarded $5,000 in punitive \ndamages to each inmate. Id. The Court rejected the defendant's constitutional \nchallenge to the punitive awards, finding that \"[t]here is no glaring disparity \nbetween the compensatory damages awarded here (between $2,000 and $10,000), \nand a punitive damages award of $5,000.\" Id at * 10. \nThe conduct of the two correctional officer defendants in Shepherd was \nmore egregious than the officer's actions in Curry and Kuschel' s actions here. For \nexample, one of the officers in Shepherd \"rammed\" a metal wand between the \nplaintiffs \"butt cheeks\" while the other officer handcuffed the plaintiff and then \n\"grabbed [his] testicles, and kept on squeezing [his] genital area for 30 to 50 \nseconds.\" 2018 WL 3122053, at *2-*3 (internal quotation marks omitted; \nalterations in the original). The defendants in Shepherd also threatened to anally \nrape the plaintiff and taunted him repeatedly. Id. at *3. The jury in Shepherd \nawarded the plaintiff one dollar in nominal damages and $20,000 in punitive \ndamages. Id. at * 1. In upholding the damages award, the court noted that the \ndefendants' \"conduct was violent in nature, involved a threat of serious sexual \nviolence, and was accompanied by comments suggesting that [they] [were] acting \nmaliciously.\" Id. at *7. \n17 I was able to find one other case where a prison guard was found liable for \nsexually assaulting a fully clothed prisoner. In Morton v. Johnson, 2015 WL \n4470104 (W.D. Va. July 21, 2015), the court entered a default judgment against a \nmale prison guard accused by a female inmate of \"touch[ing] her breast\" and \n\"rub[bing] down [her] stomach ... to [her] private area\" where he \"felt [her] up\" \nas he \"hugged\" her. Id. at * 1. The court awarded the inmate $2,000 in \ncompensatory damages and \"$5,000 in punitive damages to punish [the defendant] \nfor his reprehensible conduct and to deter other correctional officers from \ncommitting similar abuses against the individuals placed in their custody.\" Id. at \n*9. \nBased on my review of these cases and the cases cited by both parties, I find \nthat the jury's punitive award in this case was excessive and violated Kuschel's \ndue process rights. The punitive damages award in Shepherd-$20,000-was \n96% less than the punitive award in this case even though the officers' conduct in \nShepherd was much more violent, threatening, and malicious than Kuschel' s \nconduct. A $500,000 award under the circumstances of this case shocks the \nconscience and grossly exceeds what was required to serve the needs of deterrence \nand punishment. Leaving in place such an exorbitant award will also dissuade \ncorrectional officers from conducting searches they would otherwise perform and \nlead to the introduction of weapons and contraband into Delaware's prisons. It \n18 will also deter competent professionals from seeking out correctional officer \npositions. All told, allowing a $500,000 punitive award to stand will result in \nincreased security risks in an already dangerous environment. \nIn my view, $5,000-the same amount awarded in Curry and Morton-is an \nappropriate punitive award in this case. Kuschel' s actions were on par with the \ndefendants' conduct in those cases, and a $5,000 penalty is adequate to punish \nKuschel for his actions and deter others from engaging in the type of conduct for \nwhich he was found liable. A $5,000 punitive award is also in line with punitive \nawards imposed against correctional officers for more egregious sexual assaults \nagainst inmates. See, e.g., Lagarde v. Metz, 2017 WL 457654, at *1-*2, *6 (M.D. \nLa. Feb. 2, 2017) (awarding plaintiff inmate $1 in nominal damages and $1,000 in \npunitive damages where defendant demanded oral sex from the plaintiff, attempted \nto penetrate the plaintiffs anus with a broomstick, and threw the plaintiff to the \nground); Carrington v. Easley, 2011 WL 2132850, at *l, *4-*5 (E.D.N.C. May \n25, 2011) (awarding plaintiff$! in nominal damages and $5,000 in punitive \ndamages where defendant grabbed the plaintiffs penis and attempted to perform \noral sex on him); McKinley v. Trattles, 732 F.2d 1320, 1322-23, 1327-28 (7th Cir. \n1984) (affirming the jury's finding that two defendants conducted unconstitutional \nstrip searches of plaintiff inmate, including by putting their fingers in plaintiffs \nanal cavity, but setting aside the jury's punitive damages award of $15,000 and \n19 suggesting that the district court enter a punitive damages award of no more than \n$6,000); see also Oxendine-Bey v. Harihan, 2015 WL 5331809, at *3-*4, *8-*9 \n(E.D.N.C. July 22, 2015) (awarding plaintiff inmate $5,000 in compensatory \ndamages and $5,000 in punitive damages where defendant, a prison medical \nprovider, sexually fondled an inmate multiple times during medical examinations), \nreport and recommendation adopted, 2015 WL 5330571 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 14, \n2015). \nDrumgo argues that \"[c]ourts have upheld punitive damages awards over \nsix-figures where a correctional officer sexually assaulted an inmate.\" D.I. 224 at \n13. But the assaults in the six cases he cites in support of this assertion are not \ncomparable to the assault in this case. In five of the cases, the defendant raped the \nplaintiff. See Doe v. United States, 2018 WL 2431774, at *6 (D. Ariz. May 30, \n2018) (noting that male prison guard defendant \"repeatedly raped [female inmate \nplaintiff] over several months\"); Etters v. Shanahan, 2013 WL 787344, at *1-*3 \n(E.D.N.C. Feb. 6, 2013) (noting that male correctional officer defendant assaulted \nfemale inmate plaintiff repeatedly, including \"one incident in the laundry room \nwhere [defendant] grabbed her by the hair, pulled her back into a conference room, \nand had her perform oral sex,\" \"another incident by a cleaning closet, [where] he \nraped her vaginally and anally,\" and a third incident where he \"handcuffed \n[plaintiff] and, apparently after forcing her to have oral sex, was attempting to \n20 anally rape her when he was interrupted by a bell indicating that another officer \nwas coming\"), report and recommendation adopted, 2013 WL 792834 (E.D.N.C. \nMar. 4, 2013); Ortiz v. Lasker, Jr., 2010 WL 3476017, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, \n2010) (noting that male defendant correctional officer attempted to rape female \ninmate plaintiff on one occasion and then, in second incident, \"tore off some of her \nclothing and did have sexual intercourse with her\" against her will on a table); \nCash v. County of Erie, 2009 WL 3199558, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2009) \n(noting that male prison guard defendant had sexual intercourse with female \npretrial detainee plaintiff without her consent); Hall v. Terrell, 648 F. Supp. 2d \n1229, 1231 (D. Colo. 2009) (noting that female inmate plaintiff was victim of \ndefendant correctional officer's \"ongoing sexual abuse and a brutal rape\"). \nMoreover, in three of these cases the punitive damages awards were half of or less \nthan half of the punitive award in this case. See Doe v. United States, 2018 WL \n2431774, at *5 ($200,000 punitive award); Etters, 2013 WL 787344, at *1-*3 \n($100,000 punitive award); Ortiz, 2010 WL 3476017, at *1 ($250,000 punitive \naward); Cash, 2009 WL 3199558, at *1 ($150,000 punitive award). \nIn the only nonrape case cited by Drumgo, the court awarded the plaintiff \n$350,000 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages. See Doe v. \nGreen, 2021 WL2188534, at* 1-*2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2021), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2021 WL 2188148 (S.D.N.Y. May 28, 2021). But even \n21 though the punitive damages award in Green was less than half of what the jury \nawarded Drumgo, the conduct of the defendant in Green was much more \nreprehensible than Kuschel' s fleeting groping of Drumgo' s genitals during a \nclothed body search. The defendant in Green sexually assaulted the plaintiff by \n\"grabbing, pushing, ... kissing, biting, and licking [her] upper body, including her \nexposed breasts; and putting his hand down [her] shorts and fondling her genitalia \nand groin ... while trapping [her] against the wall with his body.\" Id.at 2. \nIn sum, a $5,000 punitive damages award is consistent with State Farm's \n\"guideposts\" and achieves an appropriate level of punishment and deterrence under \nthe facts of this case. Such an award constitutes significant financial punishment \nfor a Delaware correctional officer. See State of Delaware, Delaware Department \nof Correction, Recruiting, Correctional Officer Pay Scales FY 2022, \nhttps://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/FY22 _ Ul O _Payscales.pdf (last visited \nAug. 23, 2022) (showing that annual salaries for the fiscal year 2022 for Delaware \ncorrectional officers range from $39,880 to $79,130). And deterrence is not an \nissue for Kuschel, who is now retired. Nor is it an issue for correctional officers in \ngeneral at Vaughn. On the contrary, Drumgo, Burroughs, and Lopez each testified \nthat Kuschel was the only officer who ever groped them inappropriately during a \nfrisk search, and Walker testified that he had never been groped by a correctional \n22 officer during a search. See Tr. 114:14-16 (Drumgo); 210:2-7 (Walker); 226:18-\n21 (Burroughs); 326:7-13 (Lopez). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I find that the admission of Burroughs's \ntestimony was not erroneous but that the jury's punitive damages award of \n$500,000 is constitutionally excessive, manifestly unjust, and should be reduced to \n$5,000. I will therefore deny Defendant's motion insofar as it seeks a new trial, \ngrant the motion insofar as it seeks to amend the judgment, and reduce the punitive \ndamages award to $5,000. \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n23 "}
