(collectively, \u201cSt. Jude\u201d \nor \u201cDefendants\u201d).  Presently before the Court is St. Jude\u2019s \u201cM otion to D ismiss Plaintiff\u2019s \nAmended Complaint[,]\u201d  filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (the \n\u201cMotion\u201d or the \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d ).  (D.I. 65)  For the reasons that follow, the Court DENIES  \nSt. Jude\u2019s Motion.    I. BACKGROUND  \n The Court here writes primarily for the parties, who are well familiar with the issues in \nthis case.  The Court has previously provided an overview of the relevant background regarding this matter in its December 23, 2020 Memorandum Opinion (hereinafter, \u201c Guinn I \u201d), and \nincorporates that summary herein by reference.  (D.I. 50 at 2 -7)  The Court will only set out \nadditional background facts as needed, in light of the current case posture.   \nThe Court granted St. Jude\u2019s motion to dismiss the original Complaint in Guinn I , \ndismissing without prejudice Plaintiff\u2019s claims for strict liability based on defective construction and failure to warn.  ( Id. at 19)  Those claims relied heavily on facts regarding recalls and patient \ncomplaints that did not relate to the P roclaim \u2122 IPG  (the device at issue in this action , hereinafter \nreferred to as the \u201cProclaim\u201d)\u2014and that instead related to different St. Jude devices, including the Eon and Eon Mini IPG devices (the \u201cpredicate devices\u201d) as well as certain cardiac \ndefibrillator devices .  (See id. at 9)  The Court explained that in order for recalls/associated \ncomplaints relating to a different device to be relevant to Plaintiff\u2019s claims  about the Proclaim, \n\u201c[P]laintiff would at least have to plead sufficient facts explaining why\u201d such recalls/complaints \nwere relevant .  (Id. at 13)  But the allegations in Plaintiff\u2019s original C omplaint failed to establish \n3 \n such a link; instead , they made clear only that there were real differences  among the respective \ndevices .  (Id. at 13 -15)  And w ith the Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding these recalls /complaints  \nthen stripped away, the Proclaim -related allegations that remained failed to set out plausible, \nnon-preempted claims.  ( Id. at 16- 18)  To that end, the Court noted that:  (1) Plaintiff had made \nallegations regarding only a single recall involving the Proclaim , and that recall  implicated a \nproblem with the battery indicator that was not related to the harms that Plaintiff had suffered; \nand (2) Plaintiff had simply failed to explain why the allegations regarding Proclaim -related  \nadverse event reports (\u201cAERs\u201d) alone woul d be sufficient  to state a claim.   (Id.)     \nPlaintiff then filed her  Amended Complaint (\u201c FAC\u201d) on January 22, 2021.  (D.I. 58)   In \naddition to setting out claims for strict liability based on defective construction  (the \u201cdefective \nconstruction\u201d  claim ) and failure to warn (the \u201cfailure to warn\u201d claim) under the Washington \nProd uct Liability Act (\u201cWPLA\u201d) , (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 96- 122),1 Plaintiff \u2019s FAC also includes a claim for \nbreach of express warranty under the WPLA, ( id. at \u00b6\u00b6 123- 33).  The crux of Plaintiff\u2019s defective \nconstruction and failure to warn  claims  is that the Proclaim device implanted in Plaintiff\u2019s body \nin August 2016:  (1) was defective, in that it caused Plaintiff to experience  excessive heating at \nthe IPG site and premature battery depletion , ultimately  resulting in the loss of communication \nwith the device ; and (2)  that St. Jude failed to adequately supplement the Proclaim\u2019s labeling to \nwarn Plaintiff of these defects.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 8 5-88, 90, 102- 03, 118; see also D.I. 70 at 1- 2, 7 n.7, \n13)   \nIn lieu of filing an Answer, on February 8, 2021, St. Jude filed the instant Motion.  (D.I. \n65)  The Motion was fully briefed on March 15, 2021.  (D.I. 74)   \n \n1  Plaintiff\u2019s failure to warn claim in her FAC is based on a \u201cfailure to supplement \nproduct\u2019s labeling\u201d theory; she is no longer pressing a failure to warn claim based on a \u201cfailure \nto report adverse events\u201d theory.  (D.I. 70 at 2)  4 \n II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Cour t incorporates by reference the legal principles regarding motions to  dismiss \nfiled pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and those regarding the legal doctrine \nof preemption, all of which were set out in its Memorandum Opinion in the related case Mellott v. St. Jude Med., LLC , Civil Action No. 19- 1779- CJB (D. Del. Nov. 16, 2020)  (D.I. 45 at 7- 8, 9-\n14).   III. DISCUSSION    \n St. Jude  moves to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s defective construction and failure to warn claims , \narguing that the FAC does not remedy the deficiencies identified in Guinn I .\n2  (See D.I. 66 at 1 -\n2)  In its briefing, St. Jude does not make unique a rguments for dismissal as to these two types of \nclaims.  Instead, St. Jude notes that as to both claims, Plaintiff is primarily relying on two types \nof allegations :  (1) r ecall/complaint -related allegations regarding the St. Jude predicate devices  \nand defibrillator devices ; and (2) certain Proclaim -specific allegations.  St. Jude then argues that \nboth types of allegations  are wanting , and that whether these two types of allegations are \nconsidered separately or together, the y cannot suffice to set out plausible defective construction \nor failure to warn claims.     \nThe Court disagrees.  Below, in explaining why this is so, the Court will take up St. \nJude\u2019s arguments for dismissal as to both types of allegations in turn.    \nA. Recalls /Complaints  Relating to Other Devices  \n In Guinn I , the Court explained that the Complaint\u2019s allegations relating to \nrecalls /complaints relating to devices other than the Proclaim were insufficient because:  \n \n2  St. Jude does not seek dismissal of Plaintiff\u2019s breach of express warranty claim.  \n(D.I. 66 at 1, 4; D.I. 70 at 2 n.3)  5 \n (1) T he predicate device- related recalls described therein \nseemed to involve , at least for the most part, problems that \noccurred when the batteries in those devices were \nattempting to recharge, while the Proclaim device is a non -\nrechargeable device.  (D.I. 50 at 14);  \n (2) T he defibrillator devices described in that Complaint treat a \ncompletely different problem in a completely diff erent part \nof the body than does the Proclaim, ( id.); and  \n (3) T he allegation that the Proclaim\u2019s lithium battery is \nmaterially the same as the lithium battery in the predicate devices and the defibrillator devices was made \u201c[u]pon information and belief,\u201d yet the prior Complaint failed to provide the necessary predicate information for such an allegation to be sufficient, ( id. at 15).  \n \nIn opposing St. Jude\u2019s Motion, Plaintiff asserts that the FAC \u201csets forth additional factual \nallegations intended to address the Court\u2019s concerns as to the relevant similarities between the Proclaim device and St. Jude\u2019s other devices.\u201d  (D.I. 70 at 1, 10)  The FAC contains nearly 40 entirely new paragraphs of allegations; it also adds other new content to paragraphs that were \nfound in the original Complaint.  (D.I. 2; D.I. 58)   \nSt. Jude contends that the FAC still fails to establish \u201chow the devices themselves (or \ntheir design or manufacture) are similar enough to warrant the use of non- Proclaim allegation s to \nplausibly show that the Proclaim violated FDA requirements.\u201d  (D.I. 74 at 5; see also id. at 2; D.I. 66 at 6-7)  For the following reasons, the Court does not agree.    To be sure, as St. Jude notes, (D.I. 66 at 6- 7), in a number of places the FAC makes clear \nthat there are differences between the Proclaim device and St. Jude predicate devices /defibrillator devices .  For example, the FAC explains that  \n \n  (D.I. 58 at \u00b6 33 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)   The FAC \nalso alleges  \n6 \n  \n  (Id. at \u00b6 30 (internal quotation marks \nomitted) )  Th e FAC also asserts that St. Jude\u2019s premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) supplement for the \nProcl aim not ed that ,  \n \n  And with regard to the defibrillator devices, the FAC not es that these serve a different \nfunction than neurostimulation devices like the Proclaim, in that they \u201cprovide pacing for slow \nheart rhythms and electrical shock or pacing to stop or interrupt dangerously fast heart rhythms.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 66) \nBut the FAC also now includes allegations establishing the many similarities  between the \nProclaim and the predicate devices/defibrillator devices, such as the following: \n(1) In applying for approval of the Proclaim by the United \nStates Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d),  \n \n \n \n \n \n  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 32 -33 (internal \nquotation marks and emphasis  omitted)) ; \n \n(2)  \n \n \n \n \n \n  (Id. at \u00b6 35 (internal quotation marks and \nemphasis omitted);   \n (3)  \n \n7 \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  (Id. \n(emphasis omitted)) ;   \n \n(4)  \n \n \n  (Id. at \u00b6 37);  \n (5) \n \n \n \n \n  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39) ;  \n (6)  \n \n (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40 , 42-43);   \n (7)  \n \n \n \n \n (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 45 -48 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) );   \n (8) These hazards are the same or materially similar to those identified during the development and subsequent use of the predicate devices.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 14, 17-18, 23-24, 27, 49); \nand  \n \n8 \n (9) Patients who have been implanted with both the predicate \ndevices and the Proclaim have experienced these hazards .  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51, 60-61, 65, 69-73)  \n \nAccepting the FAC\u2019s allegations as true, then, and construing the FAC\u2019s allegations in \nthe light most favorable to Plaintiff  (as the Court must at this stage ), the Court agrees with \nPlaintiff that the  allegations render it at least plausible that \u201cthe battery and microelectric \ncircuitry used in the Pr oclaim device is materially the same in its functionality, performance, and \nhazards/defects \u201d as in St. Jude\u2019s other pred icate devices/defibrillator devices.  (D.I. 70 at 10  \n(emphasis in original) )  That is, the allegations in sum demonstrate that:  (1) St.  Jude\u2019s \nneurostimulation devices  (including the Proclaim ) and implantable cardiac defibrillator devices \nuse a battery component and microelectric circuitry to power the device ; (2) the Proclaim\u2019s \n\u201cdesign and functional features\u201d are based on the predicate devices; (3) the Proclaim\u2019s \n\u201cmechanical packaging, microelectronic and battery chemistry\u201d is \u201cbased on the same technology\u201d as that utilized in the pred icate  devices and defibrillator devices;  \n \n \n \n \n and (6 ) customers had similar \nreported problems with both the pr edicate devices and the Proclaim device.   (Id. at 10 -12)  \nAdmittedly, the FAC could be clearer, for example, as to what it means for  the Proclaim  to have \ncircuitry or battery chemistry that are \u201cbased on the same technology \u201d as that in pre dicate \ndevices /defibrillator devices , or for the Proclaim to have \u201cdesign and functional features\u201d that are \n\u201cbased on\u201d pr edicate devices.   (See D.I. 66 at 7- 8)  But we are at the pleading stage.  And at least \n9 \n at this stage, Plaintiff has alleged facts that, if taken as tru e, seem like they could establish that \nthe battery components and microelectric circuitry in the se other devices are sufficiently similar \nto that in the Proclaim.  Thus, it seems plausible that, to the extent that prior recall /complaint-\nrelated  evidence about predicate devices /defibrillator devices  relate to the same problems that \nPlaintiff experienced with her Proclaim device, th en that  evidence is relevant to the Motion.3  \nThe question then becomes, is  Plaintiff relying on prior recall/complaint allegations in \nher FA C that do bear relation to the problems that Plaintiff herself experienced with the \nProclaim?   \nIn her briefing, Plaintiff appeared to indicate that she is relying on five paragraphs of her \nFAC that contain prior recall allegations :  paragraphs 60-61, 64, 66 and 68.  (D.I. 70 at 7-8 & \nn.7)4  And for the reasons set out below, the Court concludes that this reliance is appropriate: \n \n3  St. Jude counters by arguing that the above allegations about similarities between \nthe Proclaim and other St. Jude devices are \u201cso general in nature\u201d that they  could apply to \nessentially all implantable medical devices, as well as to other battery -operated devices like \nflashlights and motor vehicles.  (D.I. 74 at 3- 4)  But contrary to the suggestion in Defendants\u2019 \nbriefing, ( id. at 3), Plaintiff\u2019s alleg ation  here is not just that the Proclaim and the predicate \ndevices /defibrillator devices  simply all have some type of battery and microelectric circuitry  (and \nthus can suffer from the same hazards).   \n \n \n \n \n That is more than simply an \u201call the devices \nhave a battery and circuitry\u201d-type of argument.    \n \n4  In her briefing, Plaintiff disclaimed reliance on  prior recall allegations in two \nparagraphs of the FAC :  paragraphs 62-63.  (D.I. 70 at 7 n.7 (citing D.I. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63))  These \ntwo paragraphs describe December 2011 and July 2012 recalls of the Eon and Eon Mini, \nfollowing complaints of heating at the implant site during the charging of those devices.  (D.I. 58 \nat \u00b6\u00b6 62 -63)  As the Court has previously noted in its December 23, 2020 Memorandum Opinion \nregarding Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the original Complaint, it is not clear why this recall evidence is relevant to Plaintiff\u2019s allegations,  since the Proclaim utilizes a non-rechargeable  \nbattery.  (D.I. 50 at 14; see also  D.I. 70 at 7 n.7)  The Court will not consider the allegations in \nparagraphs 62 and 63 in resolving this Motion.  \n   \n10 \n \u2022 With regard to paragraphs 60 -61 and 64, these describe \nevidence relating to 2011 and 2012 recalls involving the Eon \nMini.  The Complaint explains that these recalls were prompted by numerous customer complaints about, inter alia , the fact \nthat the battery in the Eon Mini lost the ability to \u201ccommunicate \u201d with the IPG, resulting in a loss of pain relief \nand subsequent explant surgery.  (D.I. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 60- 61, 64)   \nPlaintiff, in turn, has alleged that she had problems with her Proclaim device in 2019 stemming f rom the inability to get her \nprogrammer to connect to the IPG , due to the fact that the \ndevice\u2019s battery was \u201c\u2018dead.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 88, 90)\n5 \n \n\u2022 With regard to paragraphs 66 and 68, these describe the FDA\u2019s publication in 2016 and 2018 of Safety Communications  \nrelating to the \u201c premature battery depletion \u201d of the lithium \nbattery used to power certain of St. Jude\u2019s defibrillator devices .  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68 )  And Plaintiff alleges that in 2017, her \nProclaim device had signaled that it was suffering from \u201clow battery life\u201d that occurred \u201cmuch sooner than the expected and \nwarranted longevity of the battery.\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 8 6 (emphasis \nomitted) ) \n \nAdditionally, as noted above, the FAC also  includes other allegations about customer \ncomplaints \u2014via  its citations to relevant  Risk Assessments, Risk Management Reports,  Risk \nTables , patient complaints and AERs \u2014asserting that the predicate devices caused problems like \nexcessive heating at the implant site, reduced battery life, or loss of all communication between \nthe battery and  the IPG.  (D.I. 70 at  13 (citing D.I. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17- 18, 21- 24, 27, 69- 70))  The \n \n5  St. Jude notes that in these paragraphs relating to the 2011 and 2012 recall \nevidence, the FAC states that these recalls were also prompted by customer complaints t hat the \nEon/Eon Mini\u2019s battery failed to \u201crecharge[.]\u201d  (D.I. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 60- 61, 64; see also  D.I. 74 at 3 n.2)  \nAs stated above in footnote 4, the Court agrees with St. Jude that, because the Proclaim has a non-rechargeable battery, Plaintiff has not shown how these complaints relating to the \n\u201crecharg[ing]\u201d process would be relevant to the injuries Plaintiff has suffered.  But in her briefing, Plaintiff pointed out that this recall evidence did not only  relate to customer complaints \nabout \u201crecharg[ing]\u201d \u2014it also relates to complaints about the devices\u2019 failure to \u201ccommunicate\u201d \nwith their battery.  (D.I. 70 at 7 n.7)  The Court can now see how these latter type of complaints would seem to be relevant here, as set out above.    \n 11 \n FAC pleads that Plaintiff dealt with these same issues with regard to the Proclaim.  (D.I.  58 at \u00b6 \u00b6 \n86, 88, 90) \nTherefore, the Court will take into account the above- referenced allegations  in resolving \nthis Motion.  Th ese are not the only allegations  the Court considers as to plausibility here, \nhowever, as the Court will further discuss below. \nB. Proclaim -Specific Allegations  \nThe Court turns next to the FAC\u2019s Proclaim -specific allegations .  They too help to \nplausibly establish Plaintiff\u2019s claims.6   \nCertain of these allegations relate to the Proclaim\u2019s Risk Table.  As noted above, the FAC \nexplains how, during development of the Proclaim, St. Jude analyzed the device for it s potential \nhazards and risk s by looking at the hazard analyses and complaint data for the predicate devices, \nand published these in a March 2015 report, which included a Risk Table.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42-44 & \nex. A )  The Risk Table identifie s as potential hazards , inter alia ,  \n \n \n \n  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 45-48 (internal quotation marks omitted) )   \n \n6  Plaintiff\u2019s FAC includes one allegation (that had also been in Plaintiff\u2019s original \nComplaint) relating to a recall of the Proclaim device itself; the recall was prompted by an error \nin measuring the difference between the device\u2019s battery indicator status and the actual longevity of the battery.  (D.I. 58 at \u00b6 67)  However, the Court explained in Guinn I  that this problem does \nnot appear to be related to the harms that Plaintiff actually suffered.  (D.I. 50 at 17-18)  And Plaintiff acknowledges in her brief that \u201cthere exists no relevan t recall history (thus far) for the \nProclaim[.]\u201d  (D.I. 70 at 6)  Thus, this allegation does not impact the Court\u2019s analysis here.   \n \n12 \n St. Jude argues that t hese allegations are irrelevant because they describe possible risk s \nthat St. Jude then mitigated  (thus leading the FDA to grant the PMA for the Proclaim device) .  \n(D.I. 66 at 10- 11; D.I. 74 at 6, 8)  But as Plaintiff re torts, just because St. Jude was required to \ntake steps to mitigate these risks before its Proclaim product was to be sold, that does not mean \nthat these risks were in fact entirely  eliminated.  A nd other allegations in the FAC es tablish that \nthese hazards actually occurred in both the predicate devices and in the Proclaim.  (D.I. 70 at 13)\n7  These allegations include  those relating to Plaintiff\u2019s own experience with the Proclaim, \n(D.I. 58 at  \u00b6\u00b6 86 -88, 90), as well as to t hose rel ating to AER s for the Proclaim , (id. at \u00b6\u00b6 71- 73).   \nPlaintiff also relies on certain alle gations relating to the Proclaim\u2019s AERs .  In response, \nSt. Jude contends that the mere ex istence of AERs relating to a device does not mean that a \ndevice is defective or that St. Jude was required to warn about such defects .  (D.I. 66 at 12; D.I. \n74 at 9- 10)  However, t he Court agrees with Plaintiff that , taken together with the other \nallegations of the FAC , the allegations descr ibing AERs for the Proclaim at minimum help to \nsupport a plausible claim that the Proclaim was defective when implanted in Plaintiff.  (D.I. 70 at \n13)  This is true e ven with respect to AER data generated after the device was implanted in \nPlaintiff.  ( Id. (\u201c[E]vidence of the Proclaim\u2019s real life results, as predicted by St. Jude\u2019s own \nhazard analyses, provides powerful post hoc evidence of the SCS device\u2019s condition when sold \n \n7  St. Jude also contends that because the FDA approved the PMA based on the \nsubmitted documents including the Risk Table, then any claims based on such materials are \npreempted, since any other outcome would amount to a challenge to the FDA\u2019s determination of the safety and effectiveness of the device.  (D.I. 66 at 11; D.I. 74 at 9)   The Court is not \npersuaded.  Plaintiff\u2019s point is that the Risk Table demonstrates that St. Jude had identified certain risks relating to the Proclaim that then  subsequently actually occurred; thus, these \nallegations help to support Plaintiff\u2019s claims that:  (1) the Proclaim device implanted in Plaintiff suffered from defects  that led to similar harm for Plaintiff; and (2) St. Jude should have \nsupplemented its label to warn patients of the haz ards associated with premature battery \ndepletion, battery overheating and burning and lead failure.  \n  13 \n to Ms. Guinn.\u201d)) ; cf., Gordon v.  B. Braun Med.  Inc., Case No. 1:19- cv-121, 2020 WL 1491378, \nat *8 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 27, 2020) (\u201c[B] ased on the facts Plaintiff has alleged in the complaint, the \nCourt finds that the filter plausibly exhibited either a design or manufacturing defect.  This can \nbe inferred from the outcome \u2014the filter\u2019s  tilt\u2014in combination with the adverse MAUDE reports \nand other reports cited by the Plaintiff.\u201d).    \n Taken together with the above -referenced recall/complaint allegations  as to pred icate \ndevices/defibrillator devices , the Proclaim -specific allegations in the F AC establish plausible \nparallel claims that survive preemption.8     \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n \n8  Plaintiff\u2019s answering brief concludes by arguing that the FAC more specifically \nconnects the defects that Plaintiff experienced to alleged violations of federal requirements  (and \nthat the allegations therefore establish plausible parallel claims for the Proclaim) .  (D.I. 70 at 14-\n15 & nn.10- 14)  For example, with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s defective construction claim, the FAC \nalleges that St. Jude manufact ured and/or sold to Plaintiff a Proclaim that was \u201cadulterated\u201d \npursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351, in that it did not conform to certain identified good manufacturing \npractices (\u201cGMPs\u201d) required by the FDA, including 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 820.90(a) and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 820.100(a)(3).  (D.I. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 81, 106, 110)  And in connection with Plaintiff\u2019s failure to warn \nclaim, the FAC alleges that, for example, St. Jude failed to supplement its label to adequately warn Plaintiff\u2019s physicians of the hazards of the Proclaim device in violation of regulations including 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 801.109 and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.39(d)(2).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 75, 118)  Plaintiff also \npoints to the Risk Tables of the predicate devices and Proclaim, which identified the hazards that Plaintiff experienced and related th em to, inter alia , manufacturing errors and inadequate \nlabeling, as lending further support for her claims.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, 23, 45 -48)  Finally, Plaintiff \ncontends that these alleged violations of federal regulations parallel state law requirements under the WPLA.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 97 -101, 116- 17)   \n The Court agrees , and indeed, St. Jude does not fight back with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s \nargument here, except to contend that the Risk Tables cannot show that the Proclaim violated federal regulations.  (D.I. 74 at 8 -9)  To that point, though, Plaintiff is not relying solely on the \nRisk Tables to show that St. Jude violated federal requirements.  (D.I. 70 at 14- 15)  Rather, \nPlaintiff\u2019s point is that the Risk Tables demonstrate that if a device causes excessive hea ting, for \nexample, then possible causes of any excessive heating- related damage that Plaintiff suffered in \ncould be manufacturing errors and inadequate labels/warnings, which are at least relevant to Plaintiff\u2019s claims here.  ( Id.)  In sum, the Risk Tables  are one piece of a larger puzzle that \ncollectively, plausibly establishes Plaintiff\u2019s claims.   14 \n For the reasons set out above, the Court DENIES  the Motion.  \n An appropriate Order follows.  \nBecause this Memorandum Opinion may contain confidential information, it has been \nreleased under seal, pending review by the parties to allow them to submit a single, jointly proposed, redacted version (if necessary) of the  Memorandum Opinion.  Any such redacted \nversion shall be submitted no later than November 1, 2021 for review by the Court .  It should be \naccompanied by  a motion for redaction that shows that the presumption of public access to \njudicial records has been rebutted with respect to the proposed redacted material, by including a factually -detailed ex planation as to how that material is the \u201ckind of information that courts will \nprotect and that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d  In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Court will subsequently issue a \npublicly- available version of its  Memorandum Opinion. \n "}
