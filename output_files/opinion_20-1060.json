(D.I. 2) Lugo seeks\njudicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s February 25, 2019 final decision denying Lugo\u2019s claim\nfor disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) under Titles\nII and XVI of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433, 1381-1383f. Currently\nbefore the court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Lugo and the Commissioner.\u2019\n\n(DI. 20; D.I. 23) For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the court DENY Lugo\u2019s\n\n' Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge to conduct all proceedings in this\nmatter through final judgment, and the case was assigned to the undersigned judicial officer on\nSeptember 20, 2021. (D.I. 27)\n\n3 The briefing for the present motions is as follows: Lugo\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 21), the\nCommissioner\u2019s combined opening brief in support of the motion for summary judgment and\nanswering brief in opposition to Lugo\u2019s motion (D.I. 24), and Lugo\u2019s combined answering and\nreply brief (D.I. 25).\nmotion for summary judgment (D.I. 20), and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for\nsummary judgment (D.I. 23).\nL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nLugo protectively filed applications for DIB and SSI in April 2015, alleging a disability\nonset date of June 6, 2014 due to a herniated disc, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, arthritis,\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. (D.I. 18 at 143, 231-39) Lugo\u2019s claims were\ndenied initially in April 2016 and upon reconsideration in February 2017. (/d. at 141-47) At\nLugo\u2019s request, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on February 6, 2019. (Ud. at\n50-76)\n\nDuring the hearing, Lugo amended her alleged disability onset date to June 7, 2016. (Id.\nat 53-55) Lugo\u2019s date last insured for purposes of her DIB application was December 31, 2018.\n(D.I. 18 at 267) Thus, Lugo must establish her disability on or before that date to be entitled to\nbenefits. The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on February 25, 2019, finding that Lugo was\ncapable of a reduced range of light work. (D.I. 18 at 28-41) The Appeals Council subsequently\ndenied Lugo\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final\ndecision of the Commissioner. (/d. at 7-9)\n\nLugo brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on August 11, 2020. (D.I.\n2) Lugo filed her pending motion for summary judgment on June 6, 2021 (D.I. 20), and the\nCommissioner cross-moved for summary judgment on August 2, 2021 (D.I. 23). Briefing is now\ncomplete on the pending motions.\n\nB. Medical History\n\nLugo was 52 years old on the date of her hearing before the ALJ in February 2019. (D.I.\n18 at 56) Lugo has a twelfth-grade education and has past relevant work as a housekeeping\nmanager. (Id. at 57, 59-60) The ALJ found that Lugo had the following severe impairments:\ndegenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine; obesity; major depressive disorder; and\ngeneralized anxiety disorder. (/d. at 30) Lugo challenges the ALJ\u2019s assessment of her low back\npain and diagnosis of fibromyalgia. (D.I. 21 at 11-18) Because Lugo does not challenge the\nALJ\u2019s conclusions regarding the balance of her impairments, including her mental impairments,\nthe court does not address those conditions here.\n1. Medical evidence\n\nLugo\u2019s medical records document a history of lower back pain beginning in 2014. An X-\nray of Lugo\u2019s lumbar spine in June 2014 showed moderate degenerative changes in her right hip,\nas well as disc space narrowing and spurring in her lumbar vertebrae. (D.I. 18-1 at 56) An\nAugust 2014 MRI revealed mild disc space narrowing and disc protrusion at the L4-5 level and\nbilateral mild facet arthritis at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. (/d. at 65) During this time, Lugo\ntreated with Carol Alvarado, M.D., an internist, who diagnosed Lugo with fibromyalgia, among\nother conditions. (Jd. at 51-55, 60-64) Dr. Alvarado treated Lugo\u2019s back symptoms by\nprescribing a pain reliever, a muscle relaxant, and nerve pain medication. (/d.) Lugo also began\nattending physical therapy in July 2014 to improve her strength, flexibility, and range of motion.\n(Ud. at 58-59, 538-49)\n\nIn September 2015, Lugo began seeing Neeraj Kapur, M.D., a pain management\nspecialist, for low back and leg pain. (D.I. 18-1 at 184-87, 191) Dr. Kapur noted that Lugo\nexperienced no side effects from ibuprofen, Neurontin, and Flexeril, but her pain level remained\na 9 out of 10, and physical therapy likewise failed to provide long-term relief. (/d at 187) On\n\nexamination, Dr. Kapur described Lugo\u2019s bilateral positive straight leg raise test results in both a\nseated and reclining position and observed that Lugo experienced pain in response to extension\nand rotation of the spine. (/d.) However, Lugo exhibited intact sensation and full strength in her\nextremities. (/d.) Dr. Kapur diagnosed Lugo with lumbar radiculopathy, intervertebral disc\ndisorder, and spondylosis with myelopathy. (/d. at 185) Lugo underwent epidural nerve block\ninjections in September and October 2015, which reduced her pain temporarily. (/d. at 148, 157,\n195, 200) Dr. Kapur\u2019s findings remained largely consistent through the beginning of 2016. (id.\nat 205, 210)\n\nLugo began treating with Bikash Bose, M.D., a neurosurgeon, in February 2016. (D.I.\n18-1 at 215-16) Dr. Bose noted positive bilateral straight leg testing and slightly reduced\nstrength in Lugo\u2019s lower extremities, and he advised Lugo to obtain updated imaging studies.\n(Id. at 216) Lugo\u2019s EMG results the following month were normal, but a bone scan showed\nincreased degenerative and arthritic changes. (/d. at 225) In April 2016, Lugo underwent an\nMRI scan which showed mild findings of degenerative disc disease and stable mild lumbar\nspondylosis with left foraminal disc protrusion. (/d. at 267) Upon reviewing the test results, Dr.\nBose recommended right sacroiliac (\u201cSI\u201d) joint injections and a provocative lumbar discography\nto identify the source of the pain. (/d. at 263)\n\nDr. Kapur administered the SI joint injection on May 23, 2016. (D.I. 18-2 at 179)\nTreatment notes from Dr. Kapur during this time period were largely consistent with his earlier\ntreatment notes, with an added diagnosis of sacroiliitis.* (Jd. at 177-78, 180-81) Lugo was also\n\nevaluated by Sheerin Javed, M.D., a rheumatologist, in May 2016. (D.I. 18-1 at 312-14) An\n\n4 Sacroiliitis is defined as \u201can inflammation of one or both of your sacroiliac joints \u2014 situated\nwhere your lower spine and pelvis connect,\u201d causing pain in the buttocks or lower back that can\nextend down one or both legs. See https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-\nconditions/sacroiliitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350747.\n\n4\nexamination revealed tenderness and stiffness in Lugo\u2019s lumbar spine, with a normal range of\nmotion in her lower extremities, and Dr. Javed diagnosed Lugo with fibromyalgia, morbid\nobesity, and osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine. (/d. at 313, 316)\n\nLugo continued to see Dr. Kapur, Dr. Javed, and Dr. Alvarado through the relevant time\nperiod, and their examination findings were largely stable. Dr. Kapur\u2019s records described\nminimal to moderate tenderness in the lumbar spine and full strength in the lower extremities\nthrough January 2019. (See, e.g., D.I. 18-2 at 118, 120, 123, 163, 165, 173, 175) Dr. Alvarado\u2019s\nrecords confirmed no neck or joint pain and a normal range of motion. (See, e.g., D.I. 18-2 at\n199, 203, 213, 216, 228) Dr. Javed indicated that Lugo periodically experienced worsening\nmyalgias and fatigue, but Lugo denied joint pain, joint swelling, morning stiffness, weakness,\ncramps, or shooting pain in her extremities. (See, e.g., D.I. 18-1 at 315, 403, 407) Lugo\nconsistently exhibited a normal range of motion in her extremities and some tenderness in her\nlumbar spine. (/d. at 316, 403) Treatment for Lugo\u2019s low back pain included pain medication\nand injections, as well as a referral to physical therapy in 2018. (See, e.g., D.I. 18-2 at 121, 129;\nD.I. 18-1 at 487-536) Dr. Kapur attempted to perform a discogram in February 2017, but Lugo\ncould not tolerate the procedure due to pain. (D.I. 18-2 at 161)\n\n2. Medical opinions\n\nIn April 2016, prior to Lugo\u2019s amended alleged disability onset date, a state agency\nphysician reviewed Lugo\u2019s medical records and opined that she was capable of performing a\nrange of light work. (D.I. 18 at 89) The state agency physician observed that Lugo had no issues\nwith her personal care, and she was able to care for her grandchildren and perform activities of\ndaily living independently. (/d. at 81-82) Because Lugo\u2019s impairments caused only mild to\n\nmoderate restrictions, the state agency physician opined that Lugo was capable of performing her\npast relevant work as a housekeeping manager. (Jd. at 89) In February 2017, a second state\nagency physician reviewed the evidence and reaffirmed the recommendation of a light residual\nfunctional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). (/d. at 115)\n\nDr. Irwin Lifrak conducted a consultative exam on January 24, 2017. (D.I. 18-1 at 320-\n26) He noted that Lugo maintained a normal gait but had a mild limp favoring her left side,\nreduced range of motion and muscle spasms in her lumbar region, and lowered sensation on the\nplantar surface of her left foot. (Jd. at 322-23) Dr. Lifrak diagnosed Lugo with degenerative\njoint disease and possible disc damage, diabetes, hypertension, anxiety, and depression, but he\nfound she retained full strength and had no atrophy, wasting, or joint effusion. (Id. at 322-24)\nBased on these findings, Dr. Lifrak opined that Lugo was capable of sitting and standing for six\nhours out of an eight-hour workday without the aid of an assistive device and found she could lift\nup to ten pounds frequently. (/d. at 324)\n\nDr. Alvarado completed a form in September 2017 opining that Lugo would be unable to\nwork for six to twelve months. (D.I. 18-1 at 359) In September 2019, Dr. Alvarado opined that\nLugo\u2019s depression and anxiety limited her ability to function, and Lugo could sit less than two\nhours and stand for about two hours in an eight-hour workday. (/d. at 563) Dr. Alvarado\npredicted that Lugo would be off task for approximately twenty percent of a typical workday and\nLugo was likely to be absent from work about four days per month. (Jd. at 565)\n\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n\n1. Lugo\u2019s Testimony\n\nDuring the February 6, 2019 hearing before the ALJ, Lugo testified that she lives with the\n\nparents of a friend, she has a twelfth-grade education, and she is able to understand, speak, read,\n\nand write English. (D.I. 18 at 56-57) She testified that she worked as a housekeeping manager\nuntil 2013. (Id. at 59-60)\n\nLugo described how she experiences constant low back pain with numbness that extends\ninto her legs. (D.I. 18 at 60-61) She represented that her pain is still seven or eight out of ten\neven when she takes gabapentin, Flexeril, and Percocet. (/d. at 61) She also reported that the\nmedications make her sleepy. (/d.) According to Lugo, physical therapy and injections only\ntemporarily relieve her lower back pain. (Jd. at 61-62) Lugo also testified about her neck pain,\nwhich causes stiffness in her shoulders and results in debilitating migraine headaches. (/d. at 62)\nLugo attributed her lower back pain and her neck pain to her diagnosis of fibromyalgia. (Jd. at\n62-63)\n\nLugo testified that she cleans her bedroom, her bathroom, and the kitchen area about once\na week. (Jd. at 67) She can dress and bathe herself independently. (D.I. 18 at 68-69)\n\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing in February 2019, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical\nto vocational expert (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\nWhat I would like you to do is to assume an individual of claimant\u2019s age,\n\neducation, and work history who can perform work at the light exertional level;\n\nwho can occasionally climb ramps, stairs, ladders, ropes, and scaffolds; who can\n\noccasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; who can have occasional\n\nexposure to extreme cold vibration and hazards; and who can perform simple,\n\nunskilled tasks with no fast pace or strict production requirements with occasional\n\nchanges in the work setting; and occasional interaction with the public. Could\n\nthis person perform the claimant\u2019s past work?\n\n(DL. 18 at 72) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a hypothetical\nindividual would not be able to perform Lugo\u2019s past work as a housekeeping manager. (Id.)\nHowever, the VE indicated that such a hypothetical individual could work as a sorter, a router,\n\nor an inspector in the light exertional category. (/d.) The ALJ then asked the VE if these\n\npositions would still be available to a hypothetical individual who would be off-task fifteen\npercent or more of the workday, and the VE responded that there would be no work in the\nnational economy for such an individual. (/d. at 72-73)\n\nIn response to questioning by Lugo\u2019s counsel, the VE testified that a hypothetical\nindividual who is consistently absent at least one day per month would not be able to maintain\nemployment. (D.I. 18 at 73) The VE also explained that the hypothetical individual\u2019s ability to\nlift less than ten pounds frequently and ten pounds occasionally would not preclude all work, but\nit would reduce the number of sorter, router, and inspector positions available by about fifty\npercent. (Id. at 74) According to the VE, a hypothetical individual who was limited to standing\nand walking for two hours in an eight-hour workday would be precluded from all work at the\nlight exertional level. (Id. at 75)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the medical evidence in the record and the testimony by Lugo and the VE, the\nALJ determined that Lugo was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period from the\nJune 7, 2016 disability onset date through the hearing date. (D.I. 18 at 28-41) The ALJ found, in\npertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act\nthrough December 31, 2018.\n\n2. The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since June 7,\n2016, the amended alleged onset date (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq., and 416.971\net seq.).\n\n3. The claimant has the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease\nof the lumbar spine; obesity; major depressive disorder; and generalized\nanxiety disorder (20 CFR 404.1520(c) and 416.920(c)).\n\n4. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525,\n404.1526, 416.920(d), 416.925 and 416.926).\n10.\n\n11.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the entire record, I find that the claimant has the\nresidual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR\n404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) except she can occasionally climb ramps, stairs,\nladders, ropes, and scaffolds; occasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and\ncrawl; can have occasional exposure to extreme cold, vibration, and hazards;\nand can perform simple, unskilled tasks, with no fast pace or strict production\nrequirements, with occasional changes in the work setting, and occasional\ninteraction with the public.\n\nThe claimant is unable to perform any past relevant work (20 CFR 404.1565\nand 416.965).\n\nThe claimant was born on June 7, 1966, and was 50 years old, which is\ndefined as an individual closely approaching advanced age, on the amended\nalleged disability onset date (20 CFR-404.1563 and 416.963).\n\nThe claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate\nin English (20 CFR 404.1564 and 416.964).\n\nTransferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability\nbecause using the Medical-Vocational Rules as a framework supports a\nfinding that the claimant is \u201cnot disabled,\u201d whether or not the claimant has\ntransferable job skills (See SSR 82-41 and 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P,\nAppendix 2).\n\nConsidering the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual\nfunctional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\nnational economy that the claimant can perform (20 CFR 404.1569,\n404.1569a, 416.969, and 416.969a).\n\nThe claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, from June 7, 2016, through the date of this decision (20 CFR 404.1520(g)\nand 416.920(g)).\n\n(DIL. 18 at 30-40)\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\n\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\n\nevidence supports the decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S.\n\nCt. 1148, 1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a reasonable\n\ncrt)\n\nPearson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 839\nF. App\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NERB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle II of the Social Security Act \u201cprovides for the payment of insurance benefits to\npersons who have contributed to the program and who suffer from a physical or mental\ndisability.\u201d Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987). Title XVI of the Social Security Act\nprovides for the payment of disability benefits to indigent persons under the SSI program. 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a). A disability is defined for purposes of SSI and DIB as the \u201cinability to engage\nin any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental\nimpairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to\nlast for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant\nis only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they preclude a return to previous work or\nengagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work existing in the national economy. Jd. at\n\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22 (2003).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir.\n1999). If the Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the\n\nsequential process, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n10\n404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4)(i). At step one, the Commissioner determines whether the\nclaimant is engaged in any substantial gainful activity. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i),\n416.920(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity, step two requires\nthe Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment or a\nsevere combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\nWhen a claimant\u2019s impairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is\npresumed disabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii). Ifa claimant\u2019s\nimpairment, either singly or in combination, fails to meet or medically equal any listing, the\nanalysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv),\n416.920(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do\ndespite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of\ndemonstrating the inability to return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(g), 416.920(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other\nwords, the Commissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in\n\nthe national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments,\n\n11\nage, education, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n\nLugo challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision in three respects: (1) the ALJ failed to pose a\nhypothetical question to the VE that comprehensively described all of the credibly established\nimpairments causing Lugo\u2019s low back pain; (2) the ALJ failed to identify Lugo\u2019s fibromyalgia\ndiagnosis as a medically determinable impairment; and (3) substantial evidence does not support\nthe ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment that Lugo has the capacity to perform light work. (D.I. 21 at 1)\n\n1. Assessment of Lugo\u2019s spine impairment\n\nLugo contends that the ALJ erred by focusing solely on her degenerative disc disease of\nthe lumbar spine and ignoring her symptoms caused by other diagnosed impairments that\nexacerbated her pain, such as sacroiliitis, osteoarthritis, and myalgias. (D.I. 21 at 11-12) In\nparticular, Lugo argues that the ALJ disregarded Dr. Kapur\u2019s treatment notes regarding Lugo\u2019s\nsacroiliitis diagnosis, the diagnostic testing results, and Dr. Bose\u2019s reports. (Jd. at 12-15)\n\nIn response, the Commissioner alleges that the symptoms associated with Lugo\u2019s\ndiagnoses of sacroiliitis and osteoarthritis were encompassed within the ALJ\u2019s consideration of\ndegenerative disc disease more broadly, and Lugo\u2019s complaints of myalgias were sporadic and of\nlimited duration. (D.I. 24 at 13-14) The Commissioner further contends that Dr. Bose\u2019s records\nare not relevant to Lugo\u2019s claim because he treated Lugo prior to her disability onset date. (Id.)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s failure to classify Lugo\u2019s sacroiliitis, osteoarthritis, and/or myalgias as severe\n\nimpairments at step two of the sequential analysis does not amount to reversible error. \u201cBecause\n\n12\na showing of any severe impairment at step two moves the claimant forward to step three, an\nALJ who errs by not finding a specific severe impairment at step two does no harm.\u201d Globis v.\nSaul, 2021 WL 1214528, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2021). Here, the ALJ determined that Lugo\u2019s\ndegenerative disc disease, obesity, depression, and anxiety satisfied step two and proceeded to\nthe subsequent steps of the analysis. (D.I. 18 at 30) Accordingly, \u201cany error at Step Two would\nnot alter the remainder of the five-step process, much less the overall outcome.\u201d Orr v. Comm\u2019r\nof Soc. Sec., 805 F. App\u2019x 85, 88 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Ray v. Berryhill, 915 F.3d 486, 492 (7th\nCir. 2019) (\u201cStep two is merely a threshold inquiry; so long as one of a claimant\u2019s limitations is\nfound to be severe, error at that step is harmless.\u201d)).\n\nLugo emphasizes that the ALJ must nonetheless incorporate all credibly established\nlimitations into the hypothetical question. (D.I.21 at 12) But the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment\nsufficiently incorporates the impairments associated with all of Lugo\u2019s conditions affecting her\nlower back and lower extremities. See Hess v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 931 F.3d 198, 209 (3d Cir.\n2019) (\u201cIn assessing RFC, the adjudicator must consider limitations and restrictions imposed by\nall of an individual\u2019s impairments, even those that are not \u2018severe.\u2019\u201d (quoting SSR 96-8P, at *5)).\nThe symptoms of Lugo\u2019s sacroiliitis overlap with the limitations caused by Lugo\u2019s severe\ndegenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. See Deborah T. v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2018 WL\n6477993, at *2 (D. Md. 2018) (concluding that the plaintiffs complaints of rheumatoid arthritis,\ncervical and lumbar stenosis, and multiple body arthralgias \u201coverlap in terms of their symptoms\nwith the impairments deemed severe by the ALJ,\u201d such as degeneration of the cervical and\nlumbar spine). As indicated at n.4, supra, sacroiliitis is characterized by pain in the lower back\nthat can extend down one or both legs. The record shows that Dr. Kapur treated Lugo for the\n\nsame symptoms of low back and bilateral leg pain between September 2015 and February 2016\n\n13\nprior to her diagnosis with sacroiliitis. (D.I. 18-1 at 187, 191, 195, 200, 205, 210) Dr. Kapur\nperiodically added the diagnosis of sacroiliitis beginning in May 2016 based on his findings of\noccasional tenderness in the right SI joint and right positive Gaenslen\u2019s and Patrick\u2019s tests,\u00b0 but\nLugo\u2019s complaints of low back pain and bilateral leg pain remained consistent. (D.I. 18-2 at\n118-19, 133-34, 180-81) Both before and after her diagnosis of sacroiliitis, Lugo described her\npain as constant, throbbing, shooting, stabbing, and sharp, and she consistently indicated the pain\nwas made worse by walking and prolonged standing. (/d; D.I. 18-1 at 187, 191, 195, 200, 205,\n210) Lugo emphasizes that her \u201clow back and lower extremity symptoms were a two-fold\nimpairment,\u201d but she fails to identify any further functional limitations caused by her\nimpairments beyond those already assessed by the ALJ. (D.I. 21 at 13)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s decision confirms that he considered all of the medical evidence pertaining to\nLugo\u2019s impairments in determining her RFC, including symptoms more closely associated with\nsacroiliitis such as \u201cpain and numbness extending down her right leg and reports that her legs\ngive out at times.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 33-34) The ALJ\u2019s decision also expressly acknowledges the\ninjection Lugo received in her right SI joint in May 2016 and extensively cites to the treatment\nrecords diagnosing Lugo\u2019s sacroiliitis and recommending the injection. (/d. at 34; D.I. 18-2 at\n179) Consequently, the ALJ did not err in his assessment of Lugo\u2019s credibly established\n\nlimitations. See Wirth v. Saul, 2020 WL 1303448, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 19, 2020) (finding ALJ\n\n5 The Gaenslen\u2019s and Patrick\u2019s tests are pain provocation tests used to diagnose patients with\nsacroiliac joint dysfunction. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7646135/. The\nbalance of the treatment notes from Dr. Kapur\u2019s office covering a majority of the period between\n2016 and 2019 indicated objective findings of no tenderness in the right SI joint and negative\nGaenslen\u2019s and Patrick\u2019s tests. (D.I. 18-2 at 135-60, 163-78) Contrary to Lugo\u2019s representations\nthat \u201cDr. Kapur maintained Ms. Lugo\u2019s diagnosis of sacroiliitis from 2016 to 2019,\u201d the record\nreflects that Dr. Kapur frequently did not include a diagnosis of sacroiliitis in his treatment notes\nduring this period. (D.I. 21 at 13) Indeed, from October 2016 to January 2017, Dr. Kapur did\nnot include sacroiliitis among Lugo\u2019s diagnosed conditions. (D.I. 18-2 at 163-70, 173)\n\n14\nadequately considered the plaintiffs sacroiliitis despite his finding that only the plaintiff's\ndegenerative disc disease constituted a severe impairment).\nLugo also argues that the ALJ erred in failing to consider the treatment notes from Dr.\nBose between February and May 2016, which further supports Dr. Kapur\u2019s diagnosis of\nsacroiliitis. (D.I. 21 at 14-15) The ALJ\u2019s decision confirms that he did consider Dr. Bose\u2019s\nrecords, noting that Lugo\u2019s March 2016 EMG results were normal. (D.I. 18 at 33) To the extent\nthat Dr. Bose\u2019s records contain evidence of Lugo\u2019s sacroiliitis that was not expressly considered\nby the ALJ, Lugo acknowledges that this evidence \u201csupport[s] Dr. Kapur\u2019s diagnosis of\nsacroiliitis[.J\u201d (D.I. 21 at 14) For the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraphs, the ALJ\u2019s\nconsideration of this evidence was sufficient and Lugo failed to establish additional limitations\nbeyond those considered by the ALJ in connection with the conditions of her lower back and\nlower extremities. In addition, Dr. Bose\u2019s treatment records predate Lugo\u2019s alleged onset date of\nJune 7, 2016. (D.I. 18-1 at 215-25) Courts within the Third Circuit have recognized that an ALJ\nis not obligated to find evidence prior to the onset date to be relevant or probative. See Masarik\nv. Berryhill, 2019 WL 1099803, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2019); Chestnut v. Berryhill, 2018 WL\n1243722, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2018) (citing Giese v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 251 F. App\u2019x 799,\n804 (3d Cir. 2007)).\n2. Assessment of Lugo\u2019s fibromyalgia\nLugo also challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that her fibromyalgia was not a severe\nmedically determinable impairment, despite evidence of her widespread pain and symptoms.\n(D.I. 21 at 15) According to Lugo, the ALJ erred in considering only Dr. Javed\u2019s treatment\n\nrecords and failing to consider other assessments and evidence supporting her diagnosis of\n\n15\nfibromyalgia, including evidence establishing her joint pain, stiffness, chronic fatigue, and\ndiffuse myalgias affecting her low back, hands, neck, shoulders, and chest. (id. at 15-17)\n\nIn response, the Commissioner argues that a physician\u2019s diagnosis of fibromyalgia is not,\nin itself, sufficient to establish the condition as a medically determinable impairment. (D.I. 24 at\n15) Because Lugo\u2019s medical records do not establish a history of widespread pain in all\nquadrants or repeated episodes of six or more fibromyalgia symptoms, the Commissioner argues\nthat Lugo does not satisfy the criteria of Social Security Ruling 12-2p (\u201cSSR 12-2p\u201d). (Ud. at 17)\n\nSSR 12-2p provides \u201cguidance on how we develop evidence to establish that a person has\na medically determinable impairment (MDI) of fibromyalgia (FM), and how we evaluate FM\ndisability claims and continuing disability reviews under titles II and XVI of the Social Security\nAct.\u201d SSR 12-2p, 2012 WL 3104869 (July 25, 2012). Fibromyalgia \u201cis a complex medical\ncondition characterized primarily by widespread pain in the joints, muscles, tendons, or nearby\nsoft tissues that has persisted for at least 3 months.\u201d SSR 12-2p. Under SSR 12-2p, a claimant\nmust present evidence sufficient to exclude other disorders which may cause similar symptoms,\nand the evidence must satisfy one of two sets of criteria for the diagnosis as established by the\nAmerican College of Rheumatology (\u201cACR\u201d). Jd. At issue in this case are the 2010 ACR\nPreliminary Diagnostic Criteria,\u00b0 which require a showing of: (1) a history of widespread pain in\nall quadrants of the body that has persisted for at least three months; (2) a showing of repeated\nmanifestations of six or more fibromyalgia symptoms or co-occurring conditions; and (3)\n\nevidence that other disorders which could cause the symptoms were excluded. Jd. \u201cConclusory\n\n6 These criteria are identified at \u00a7 II.B of SSR 12-2p. Despite citing to \u00a7 II.A of SSR 12-2p in\nher opening brief, Lugo does not address the requirement of at least 11 positive tender points on\nphysical examination included in the 1990 ACR Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia at\n\u00a7 ILA of SSR 12-2p. (D.I. 21 at 16)\n\n16\nstatements by a medical provider that a patient suffers from fibromyalgia are insufficient to meet\na claimant's burden at step two for establishing a medically determinable impairment[.]\u201d Fox v.\nComm'r of Soc. Sec., 2020 WL 1888251, at *5 (D.N.J. Apr. 16, 2020).\n\nIn the present case, the ALJ found that Lugo\u2019s fibromyalgia did not amount to a severe\nmedically determinable impairment at step two of the analysis because \u201cthe record does not\ndocument widespread pain throughout all quadrants of the body, and there is no evidence of\nrepeated manifestations of six or more fibromyalgia symptoms, signs or co-occurring conditions\nas required in SSR 12-2p.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 31) Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision\nbecause the medical record suggests that Lugo did not have a history of pain in all quadrants of\nthe body and axial skeletal pain that persisted for at least three months. SSR 12-2p, 2012 WL\n3104869, at *2. Instead, Lugo\u2019s pain was mostly limited to her lumbar spine and lower\nextremities.\u2019 (D.I. 18-1 at 312, 316, 413) In September 2017, Lugo experienced joint pain and\nsoreness in her hands, but she denied myalgias and an exam revealed no tenderness in her spine\nat that time. (/d. at 411-12) The following month, Lugo complained of lumbar joint pain and\ndiffuse myalgias again, but her lumbar spine was nontender on examination and her hands were\nnormal. (Jd. at 409) From March to October 2018, Lugo exhibited tenderness in her lumbar\nspine and the middle finger joint of her right hand, with no specific findings of pain or tenderness\nin her upper left quadrant during that time. (Jd. at 403-07)\n\nIn addition, the record does not support a finding of repeated manifestations of six or\nmore fibromyalgia symptoms, signs, or co-occurring conditions. SSR 12-2p describes these\n\nmanifestations to include \u201csomatic symptoms\u201d such as\n\n7 Lugo\u2019s complaints of myalgias, joint pain, and lumbar tenderness were not consistently present\nthroughout the relevant time period. (D.I. 18-1 at 411, 413, 415, 417)\n\n17\nmuscle pain, irritable bowel syndrome, fatigue or tiredness, thinking or\n\nremembering problems, muscle weakness, headache, pain or cramps in the\n\nabdomen, numbness or tingling, dizziness, insomnia, depression, constipation,\n\npain in the upper abdomen, nausea, nervousness, chest pain, blurred vision, fever,\n\ndiarrhea, dry mouth, itching, wheezing, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, hives or welts,\n\nringing in the ears, vomiting, heartburn, oral ulcers, loss of taste, change in taste,\n\nseizures, dry eyes, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, rash, sun sensitivity,\n\nhearing difficulties, easy bruising, hair loss, frequent urination, or bladder spasms.\n\nSSR 12-2p, 2012 WL 3104869, at *3 n.9. Lugo\u2019s medical records establish repeated\nmanifestations of four of these symptoms, at most: muscle pain, fatigue, depression, and\nnervousness or anxiety. Dr. Javed\u2019s records identify numerous instances of diffuse myalgias, or\nmuscle pain. (D.I. 18-1 at 403-09) Instances of fatigue were noted on two occasions by Dr.\nJaved, and Dr. Lifrak also observed decreased energy and motivation on several occasions. (/d.\nat 403, 407, 551-53, 557-59) Dr. Lifrak also repeatedly indicated that Lugo struggled with\nanxiety and depression during the relevant time period. (/d. at 552-53, 557-59)\n\nThe record otherwise contains one instance each of insomnia and dizziness. In a\ntreatment record from June 2018, Dr. Lifrak noted that Lugo suffered from insomnia. (Jd. at\n559) The balance of Dr. Lifrak\u2019s treatment notes and all of Dr. Javed\u2019s records suggest that\nLugo did not continue to suffer from insomnia during the relevant time period. (/d. at 312, 315,\n403-17, 554-58) In July 2018, Dr. Javed described a single instance when Lugo experienced a\nfall as a result of dizziness. (D.I. 18-1 at 405) Consequently, Lugo\u2019s dizziness and insomnia do\nnot satisfy the \u201crepeated manifestation\u201d requirement under SSR 12-2p. Lugo suggests in her\nbriefing and testimony that she experienced numbness in her legs (D.I. 21 at 17; D.L. 18 at 60-\n61), but this symptom is not supported by her medical records. In fact, Dr. Kapur consistently\nreported that Lugo experienced \u201c[nJo numbness or weakness of extremities\u201d throughout the\n\nrelevant time period, including in the weeks preceding the hearing before the ALJ. (D.I. 18-2 at\n\n118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155,\n\n18\n157, 159, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177) Lugo fails to cite to medical records\nestablishing the existence of any of the remaining somatic symptoms. Based on this record,\nsubstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion at step two of the sequential evaluation that\nLugo\u2019s fibromyalgia is not a severe medically determinable impairment. See SSR 12-2p, 2012\nWL 3104869, at *3.\n3. Lugo\u2019s capacity to perform light work\n\nLugo contends that the medical evidence regarding her ability to stand, walk, lift, and\ncarry does not support the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding that she has the capacity to perform light work.\n(DI. 21 at 18-19) According to Lugo, the ALJ did not explain why he disregarded medical\nrecords, diagnostic tests, and objective findings establishing that she cannot satisfy the light work\nrequirements. (/d. at 19) The Commissioner responds that the ALJ considered all of the relevant\nevidence in determining Lugo\u2019s RFC for a range of light work, and substantial evidence supports\nhis conclusion that Lugo\u2019s MRI results, examination findings, and conservative treatment\nrevealed only mild limitations. (D.I. 24 at 18-19)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s RFC finding limiting Lugo to a range of light work is supported by substantial\nevidence. Specifically, the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding is supported by objective test results showing\nstable, mild findings in Lugo\u2019s lumbar spine and medical records establishing that Lugo pursued\na conservative treatment regimen of physical therapy and pain management for the pain in her\nback and lower extremities. (D.I. 18 at 33-34, 37; D.I. 18-1 at 222, 229, 267; D.I. 18-2 at 118,\n177) The ALJ\u2019s RFC determination is also supported by the consultative exam findings of Dr.\nLifrak and the opinions of the state agency physicians, who found that Lugo was capable of\nperforming a range of light work. (D.I. 18 at 89, 115; D.I. 18-1 at 320-26) Because the ALJ\u2019s\n\nRFC determination is supported by substantial evidence, the decision is affirmed. See Gaddis v.\n\n19\nComm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 417 F. App\u2019x 106, 107 n.3 (3d Cir. 2011) (\u201cWhere the Commissioner\u2019s\nfindings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, courts are bound by those findings even if\nthey would have decided the factual inquiry differently\u2014i.e., we are not permitted to weigh the\nevidence or substitute our own conclusions for those of the fact-finder.\u201d).\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Lugo\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 20) is DENIED,\nand the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 23) is GRANTED.
