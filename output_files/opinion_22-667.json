KILGOE,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 667-RGA \n      : WESTLAKE FINANCIAL, et al.,   :  \n      :   Defendant s.   : \n \n Kenneth W. Kilgoe, Wilmington , Delaware.   Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n December  14, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Kenneth W. Kilgoe appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 5).  He commenced this action on May 23, 2022.  (D.I. \n2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff claims jurisdiction by reason of a federal question.  \n(D.I. 2 at 3).   Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was stolen on May 3, 2022. (D.I. 2 -1 at 3).  He alleges \nthat Defendants Progressive Insurance and Westlake Financial do not want to fulfill their \nobligations.  ( D.I. 2 at 4).   \n Plaintiff seeks $4,600 in damages.  ( Id. at 7).   \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or  malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, h is \npleading is liberally construed and his  Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be 2 \n held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94.    \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .   \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or d elusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id.   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provision s of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt \nmust grant Plaintiff leave to amend his  complaint unless amendment would be \ninequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.  \n2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantiv e \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id . at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; 3 \n and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n This Court does not have jurisdiction.   \nPlaintiff indicates the basis for jurisdiction i s a federal question.  (D.I. 2 at 3).  The \nComplaint alleges that Plai ntiff\u2019s car was stolen  on May 3, 2022,  and Defendants \nWestlake Financial and Progressive Insurance do not want to fulfill their obligations  to \nPlaintiff .  The scant allegations do not describe Plaintiff\u2019s relationship to Westlake \nFinancial or Progressive Insurance and do not des cribe their alleged obligations to \nPlaintiff.  I infer that Plaintiff has auto insurance with one or both of them.  I have \nreviewed the Complaint and it does not raise a federal civil claim for violations of the United States Constitution or federal statut es. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The Court does \nnot have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.  \n Nor does the Court has diversity jurisdiction .  The diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1332(a) requires complete diversity of the parties and an amount in controversy in \nexcess of $75,000.  The parties are divers e - at least as to Plaintiff  (citizen of Delaware) \nand Westlake Financial  (which has a California address).  The Complaint does not \nprovide an address for  Progressive Insurance and Daniel Allinson, who might be a third 4 \n defendant .  (If this were the only issue, I would let Plaintiff amend.).  Nonetheless, the \namount in controversy is clearly less than $75,000 based upon the prayer for reli ef that \nseeks $4,600 in damages.   Accordingly, t here is no diversity jurisdiction under 28  \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).  \n In light of the foregoing, there is no basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction \nover the matter.  Therefore, the Complaint will be dismissed without prejudice for lack  of \nsubject matter jurisdiction .      \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court  will dismiss the Complaint without prejudice for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.   \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nKENNETH W. KILGOE,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22 -667-RGA \n      : WESTLAKE FINANCIAL, et al.,   :  \n      :   Defendants.    :  \n \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 14th day of  December , 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that:  \n 1. The Complaint is DISMISSE D without prejudice for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.  \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.  \n  \n                    /s/ Richard G.
