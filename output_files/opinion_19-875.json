(CMI) and Jian Hu filed this lawsuit\nagainst Defendants,! seeking judicial review of the denial by the United States\nCitizen and Immigration Service (USCIS) of a Form I-129 Petition for\nNonimmigrant Worker filed by CMI on behalf of Hu, a citizen of China. D.I. 10\n4 1, 42. CMI filed the petition to qualify Hu under the H-1B Program and to hire\nhim for the position of sales engineer. D.I. 1091. \u201cThe H-1B program is\ndesigned to allow professionals from other countries who are employed in\n\u201cspecialty occupations\u2019 to work in the United States on a temporary basis.\u201d Gupta\nv. Sec\u2019y U.S. Dep\u2019t of Lab., 649 F. App\u2019x 119, 120 (3d Cir. 2016). USCIS\nultimately denied CMI\u2019s petition. Plaintiffs seek an order compelling USCIS to\nrescind its denial, approve CMI\u2019s H-1B petition, and designate Hu a H-1B\nnonimmigrant. D.J. 16. Pending before me are the parties\u2019 cross motions for\n\nsummary judgment. D.I. 16; D.I. 19.\n\n' Defendants Merrick Garland, Attorney General; Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary\nof Homeland Security; Tracy Renaud, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the\nDirector of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services; Connie Nolan,\nActing Associate Director, Service Center Operations Directorate; and Laura\nZuchowski, Director of the Vermont Service Center have been sued in their official\ncapacities. Thus, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d), the named defendants were\nautomatically substituted as parties upon their succession to the offices named in\nthe First Amended Complaint.\nI BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural and Factual History\nCMI is a Delaware company that engages in \u201cinternational automobile\ntrading, new and used vehicle sales, vehicle rental and leasing, collision repair and\ngeneral maintenance, vehicle financing and lending, vehicle insurance services,\nand vehicle inter-state registry services.\u201d D.I. 20 2; D.I. 24-192. Jian Hu isa\ncitizen of China. D.I. 10 \u00a7 42. Hu previously lived in the United States on F-1\nstatus but has since returned to China. D.I. 10 4 42.\nIn April 2018, CMI filed a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-\n129). The petition sought to qualify Hu under the H-1B Program so that CMI\ncould hire him for the position of \u201csales engineer\u201d for a three-year period.\nUSCIS48-51. CMI alleged in the petition that Hu held a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nEngineering with a major in Radio Technology from Hunan University. USCIS58,\n71. And it stated in a letter filed with the petition that it expected Hu to perform\nthe following tasks as a Sales Engineer:\ne Evaluate the subject automobiles from both\ntechnical and sales aspects, and create auto\nsales reports based on the inspections; apply\nprofessional knowledge to assist the company\nin pricing by analyzing the subject automobiles\nfrom technical aspects;\n\ne Explain the features of selected automobiles to\ncustomers, help customers with best solutions\nand promote sales by applying the principles of\ncustomer services;\n\ne Compare and contrast features of the\nautomobiles being traded and create products\nrating reports for the company in order for the\ncompany to better oversee the market and target\npotential customers;\n\ne Conduct products improvement\nrecommendation, and communicate with\noutside parties, such as garages, about vehicle\nservice, repair, and promotion;\n\ne Conduct research about up-to-date industry\ntrends and help the company to better\nunderstand the market from the technical aspect\nby providing internal training about automobile\ntechnology; [and]\n\ne Prepare inspection principles and manuals, and\nparticipate in products inspections with the\ncompany\u2019s inspectors from time to time, and\nsupervise their work; give suggestions to the\ncompany about the procedures of inspection.\n\nUSCIS70. CMI also included with its petition a list of the tasks \u201cSales Engineers\ntypically perform\u201d according to the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Outlook\nHandbook:\ne Prepare and deliver technical presentations\nexplaining products or services to existing and\nprospective customers\ne Talk with customers and engineers to assess\n\nequipment needs and to determine system\nrequirements\ne Collaborate with sales teams to understand\ncustomer requirements and provide sales\nsupport\n\ne Secure and renew orders and arrange delivery\n\ne Plan and modify products to meet customer\nneeds\n\ne Help clients solve problems with installed\nequipment\n\ne Recommend improved materials or machinery\nto customers, showing how changes will lower\n\ncosts or increase production\n\ne Help in researching and developing new\nproducts[.]\n\nUSCIS69-70. The petition also attached descriptions of the sales engineer position\nfrom the Occupational Outlook Handbook, the summary of the position from the\nDepartment of Labor\u2019s database of worker requirements called O*Net, Hu\u2019s\nacademic records, and Hu\u2019s resume. USCIS75-104.\n\nOn August 24, 2018, USCIS issued a Request for Evidence (RFE), asking\nCMI for evidence establishing that the sales engineer position met the statutory and\nregulatory definition of a specialty occupation. USCIS179, 184. In response to the\n\nRFE, CMI submitted a supplemental letter of support and various documents as\naccompanying evidence.? See USCIS194-96. On December 26, 2018, USCIS\ndenied CMI\u2019s application on the grounds that CMI had not sufficiently shown that\nthe offered position was a specialty occupation. USCIS561-69. Plaintiffs filed the\nComplaint in this case on May 9, 2019, D.I. 1; and, on July 19, 2019, USCIS\nreopened review of Plaintiffs\u2019 petition and issued a second RFE, USCIS579.\n\nIn the second RFE, USCIS requested \u201cevidence that details the specific\nduties of the proffered position and the nature of [CMI\u2019s] business\u201d and noted that\nthe evidence CMI had submitted up to that point was insufficient because it\nshowed that the duties of the position \u201care related to general automobile sales, . . .\nappear to be general in nature, . . . and do not appear to require the theoretical and\npractical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\u201d and thus the\n\nevidence \u201c[did] not support [CMI\u2019s] contention that this position is a specialty\n\n? Specifically, CMI included a block and line organizational chart of CMI\u2019s\nhierarchy, documents from the Occupational Outlook Handbook and Occupational\nOutlook Quarterly, thesaurus and dictionary entries for \u201cnormally\u201d and \u201ctypically,\u201d\nan \u201c[iJnformational packet from [CMI] explaining the international automobile\ntrading process,\u201d a letter from China Import Car Association to CMI, \u201c[v]arious\nindustry materials and reports relating to international automobile trading practices\nand processes,\u201d \u201c[s]ample purchase document sets, including freight agreements,\ninvoices, packing lists, and bills of lading,\u201d sample manufacturing and sales\ncontracts, copies of automobile titles listing CMI as the registered owner, copies of\nemployment advertisements for sales engineer positions at other companies,\ndocuments \u201crelating to [CMI\u2019s] two Risk/Financial Counselors\u201d (including their\ndiplomas, transcripts, and paystubs), a lease agreement for CMI, CMI\u2019s income tax\nreturns, and \u201cliterature about [CMI].\u201d USCIS194-96.\noccupation.\u201d USCIS582. On October 14, 2019, CMI responded to the second\nRFE with an opinion letter from Professor Fernando Tovia. USCIS593-645.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, USCIS issued a Notice of Intent to Deny the Petition,\nstating that Tovia\u2019s opinion letter \u201cfail[ed] to describe the position\u2019s duties with\nsufficient detail, or to establish that the job duties require an educational\nbackground, or its equivalent, commensurate with a specialty occupation.\u201d\nUSCIS646, 65061. After CMI responded with an additional opinion letter from\nTovia, USCIS662-69, USCIS denied the reopened petition, USCIS3\u201419. Plaintiffs\nthen filed an Amended Complaint in this lawsuit, D.I. 10, and the parties filed the\ncompeting motions for summary judgment now before me, D.I. 16, 19.\n\nIl. LEGALSTANDARDS\nUnder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), \u201c[a] person suffering legal\n\nwrong because of agency action . . . is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. \u201cSummary judgment is the mechanism for deciding, as a matter of\nlaw, whether the agency action is supported by the administrative record and\notherwise consistent with the APA standard of review.\u201d Blintz v. Fed. Emergency\nMgmt. Agency, 413 F. Supp. 3d 349, 360 (D. Del. 2019) (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). The APA requires a district court to \u201chold unlawful and set\naside agency action\u201d that is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n\notherwise not in accordance with [the] law[.]\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). This\n\u201cdeferential standard . . . presume[s] the validity of agency action.\u201d SBC Inc. v.\nFCC, 414 F.3d 486, 496 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted; original alteration). A court must \u201cnot... substitute its judgment for that\nof the agency in an APA challenge.\u201d NVE, Inc. v. Dept. of Health and Human\nServs., 436 F.3d 182, 190 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n\nUnder the arbitrary and capricious standard, an agency\u2019s decision will not be\nvacated unless it \u201chas relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to\nconsider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an\nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or\nis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product\nof agency expertise.\u201d Nat\u2019] Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551\nU.S. 644, 658 (2007) (citation omitted). An agency\u2019s ruling is not arbitrary and\ncapricious where the agency \u201creach[ed] its decision by examin[ing] the relevant\ndata . . . [and] articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a\nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d CBS Corp. v.\nFCC, 663 F.3d 122, 137 (3d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). An agency\u2019s findings must be upheld \u201cunless the evidence not only\nsupports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d Sheng v. Att\u2019y General of US.,\n\n365 F. App\u2019x 408, 410 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).\nI. ANALYSIS\n\nResolution of the competing motions turns on whether USCIS abused its\ndiscretion in concluding that the sales engineer position offered by CMI was not a\n\u201cspecialty occupation.\u201d Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an\nemployer can seek to employ a foreign national \u201cin a specialty occupation\u201d under\nthe H-1B program. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).. The employer and the\npetitioning employee have the burden of proof to show that the occupation in\nquestion is a \u201cspecialty occupation.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.\n\nThe INA defines \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d as \u201can occupation that requires (A)\ntheoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\nand (B) attainment of a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its\nequivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.\u201d\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184@)(1). Enabling regulations issued by the Department of\nHomeland Security pursuant to the INA also define \u201cspecialty occupation.\u201d The\ndefinitions provided in the regulations are similar but not identical to the definition\nset forth in the INA. Section 214.2(h)(4)(ii) of the regulations defines a \u201cspecialty\noccupation\u201d as\n\nan occupation which requires theoretical and practical\n\napplication of a body of highly specialized knowledge in\n\nfields of human endeavor including, but not limited to,\n\narchitecture, engineering, mathematics, physical\n\nsciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education,\n\nbusiness specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the\n\n8\narts, and which requires the attainment of a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree or higher in a specific specialty, or its equivalent,\nas a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United\nStates.\n\n8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(4)@i).. And \u00a7 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1)(4) of the regulations\nprovides that\n\n[t]o qualify as a specialty occupation, the position must\nmeet one of the following criteria:\n\n(1) A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is\nnormally the minimum requirement for entry into the\nparticular position;\n\n(2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in\nparallel positions among similar organizations or, in\nthe alternative, an employer may show that its\nparticular position is so complex or unique that it can\nbe performed only by an individual with a degree;\n\n(3) The employer normally requires a degree or its\nequivalent for the position; or\n\n(4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized\nand complex that knowledge required to perform the\nduties is usually associated with the attainment of a\nbaccalaureate or higher degree.\n\n8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(4)Gii)(A)(1)-(4).\n\nPlaintiffs argue that USCIS\u2019s denial of Hu\u2019s petition was arbitrary and\ncapricious because CMI\u2019s sales engineer position is \u201ca specialty occupation as a\nmatter of law\u201d under \u00a7 214.2(h)(4)(ii) of the regulations, D.I. 17 at 9, and the\nposition meets the criteria set forth in \u00a7 214.2(h)(4)(iii) of the regulations, D.I. 17\n\nat 12.\nA. Specialty Occupation under 8 C.E.R. \u00a7 214.2(h)(4)(ii)\n\nPlaintiffs argue that \u201cthe record in this case compels the conclusion that\nCMI\u2019s position is a specialty occupation as a matter of law because it is an\nengineering position.\u201d D.I. 17 at 4. According to Plaintiffs, \u201cthe plain language of\n[8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(h)(4)(ii)] unequivocally states that \u2018engineering\u2019 occupations are\nspecialty occupations without any qualification.\u201d D.I. 17 at 10. But that\u2019s not\nwhat the regulation says. The regulation states that a \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d is \u201can\noccupation which requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly\nspecialized knowledge in fields of human endeavor ....\u201d \u00a7 214.2(h)(4)(ii). It then\nprovides a non-exclusive list of fields of human endeavor. Jd. One of those fields\nis engineering. Jd. Other listed fields include \u201cphysical sciences,\u201d \u201csocial\nsciences,\u201d and \u201cthe arts.\u201d Id. These are clearly fields, and not, as Plaintiffs would\nhave it, occupations.\n\nUSCIS reasonably interpreted and applied this definition of occupation.\nAfter reviewing the record, USCIS explained:\n\na range of educational credentials, including many different kinds of\n\nengineering degrees in what appear to be completely unrelated fields, such\n\nas chemical, biomedical, or computer hardware engineering could qualify an\n\nindividual for the position of a Sales Engineer. ... [W]Jorkers who have a\n\ndegree in business, but who have little or no sales experience, may become\nsales engineers.\n\nUSCIS6. It concluded:\n\n10\nin order to establish a specialty occupation, a close correlation between the\nrequired \u201cbody of highly specialized knowledge\u201d and the particular position\nmust be established. Therefore, [Plaintiffs\u2019] assertion that engineering in a\nsingle field of study, without establishing how the body of specialized\nknowledge obtained from an \u201cengineering degree\u201d in so many disparate\nfields and/or disciplines is necessary to perform the duties of the position, is\ninsufficient to establish that an engineering degree in any discipline directly\nrelates to the duties and responsibilities of the particular position of a Sales\nEngineer[.]\n\nUSCIS7. This conclusion is neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n\nB. Criteria of 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 second argument is that \u201csubstantial evidence in the record would\ncompel a reasonable mind to conclude that the actual nature of CMI\u2019s sales\nengineering position renders it a specialty occupation pursuant to 8 CFR\n\u00a7214.2(h)(4)Gii)(A)(1), (2), and (4).\u201d D.L. 17 at 12. But whether a reasonable\nmind would disagree with USCIS\u2019s decision is of no moment. USCIS\u2019s decision is\npresumed to be valid, SBC, 414 F.3d at 496, and can only be set aside if it is\n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with\n[the] law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). By asking me to set aside USCIS\u2019s decision on\nthe basis of what a reasonable mind could conclude, Plaintiffs are asking me to\nimpermissibly \u201csubstitute [my] judgment for that of the agency[.]\u201d See NVE, 436\nF.3d at 190 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). My review must\n\u201cfocus[] on the agency\u2019s decision making process, not on the decision itself.\u201d Jd.\n\nIf USCIS \u201chas applied the procedures for rulemaking required by law and reached\n\n11\na rational conclusion,\u201d it is not my prerogative to set aside the action\u2014regardless\nof whether a reasonable mind could have concluded differently. See id.\n\nLargely ignoring this standard of review, Plaintiffs emphasize their\ndisagreement with the conclusion reached by USCIS rather than identifying errors\nin USCIS\u2019s process of reaching its conclusion. See D.I. 17 at 12-18. For example,\nPlaintiffs argue that\n\n[h]ad USCIS honestly and objectively applied the record in this case to its\n\nfacts it would have been unable to avoid the objective fact that the\n\n[Department of Labor\u2019s] research concludes that sales engineers must\n\nusually have a technical background equivalent to a baccalaureate degree in\n\nengineering and that 63% of sales engineers surveyed by [Department of\nLabor] have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering.\n\nDI. 17 at 13 (quotation marks omitted). Here, Plaintiffs have identified no specific\nfailure in USCIS\u2019s process. And, as an aside, the inverse of Plaintiffs\u2019 statistic is\nthat 37% of sales engineers do not have a bachelor\u2019s degree, so USCIS\u2019s\nconclusion that a bachelor\u2019s degree is not the normal minimum requirement for\nentry into sales engineering is entirely rational.\n\nAs another example, Plaintiffs argue that there is more than a\n\u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d that the sales engineering position here is \u201ca\nsophisticated position\u201d and that \u201cTovia\u2019s letters also objectively confirm the\nuniqueness and complexity of this position.\u201d D.I. 17 at 15. Plaintiffs conclude that\n\u201cany reasonable fact finder would be compelled to approve CMI\u2019s petition based\non both 8 CFR \u00a7214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(2) and (4), and that USCIS\u2019 [s] denials in this\n\n12\ncase are therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\u201d D.I. 17 at 17. The\ncrux of Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact\nfinder to reach a different conclusion. But,\n[t]o determine whether an agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously, a court\nlooks to whether the agency relied on factors outside those Congress\nintended for consideration, completely failed to consider an important aspect\n\nof the problem, or provided an explanation that is contrary to, or implausible\nin light of, the evidence.\n\nNVE, 436 F.3d at 190. Thus, it is of no moment that a different conclusion could\nhave been reached by a different reasonable fact finder because \u201c[r]eversal is\nappropriate only where the administrative action is irrational or not based on\nrelevant factors.\u201d Id.\n\nBased on the Certified Administrative Record, D.I. 18, it is apparent that\nUSCIS considered the relevant factors in a rational way. USCIS offered a detailed\ndiscussion of how and why it concluded that Tovia\u2019s letters did not support\nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Hu\u2019s position was a specialty occupation. See USCIS8-\u2014\n10. Plaintiffs offer no argument that USCIS used a flawed process or relied on\n\nirrelevant factors.> In short, USCIS properly applied the rules and regulations\n\n3 Plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that USCIS\u2019s reliance on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision\nin Defensor v. Meissner, 201 F.3d 384 (Sth Cir. 2000), was \u201carbitrary, capricious,\nand contrary to law\u201d and \u201cwarrants granting the Plaintiffs\u2019 relief[.]\u201d D.I. 17 at 20.\nBut Defensor is not cited in USCIS\u2019s final decision, so there is no basis on which\nto conclude that USCIS even relied on this case in its final decision at issue here.\n\n13\ngoverning H-1B visa applications, thoughtfully considered the evidence presented\nby Plaintiffs, and reached a rational conclusion. See id.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, I will grant Defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment and will deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\n\nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n"}
