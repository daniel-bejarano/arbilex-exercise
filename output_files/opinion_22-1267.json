No. 22- 1267 (MN)  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n  David Q. Webb, Newark , Delaware \u2013 Pro Se  Plaintiff  \n                      \n    January  5, 2023  \nWilmington, Delaware  1 \nNOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nPlaintiff  David Q. Webb  (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d)  proceeds pro se  and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 5).  He filed this action p ursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d and \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  (D.I. 2).  This Court proceeds to review and screen the matter pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).  \nI. BACKGROUND   \nThe Complaint was filed on September 27, 2022.  Plaintiff brings this action  pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and alleges violations of the Fourth, Ninth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  (D.I. 2 at 3).  The  claims concern Plaintiff\u2019s \nhospitalization at Christiana Care Health Services from August 19, 2022 through August 30, 2022.  \nThe Complaint  contains seven counts, as follows:  Count I for intentional discrimination under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e , under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act; Count II under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; Count \nIII for illegal seizure under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution; C ount IV for \ninvasion of privacy under the Ninth Amendment of the United States Constitution; Count V for violation of the right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution; Count VI for intentional infliction of emotional distress; and, Count VII for vicarious \nliability.   (Id. at 2-12).  Plaintiff seeks  compensatory and punitive damages.   (Id. at 13).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) \n(in forma pauperis  actions) .  The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true 2 and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se  plaintiff.  See Phillips v. County of Allegheny , \n515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because Plaintiff \nproceeds pro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  \nErickson , 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous be cause it fails to state a claim.  See Dooley v. \nWetzel , 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); \nsee also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002).  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous onl y where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d \nor \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Dooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d. at 374 (quoting Mitchell \nv. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327- 28).  \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) motions.  See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F .3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) \n(applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)).  B efore dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted pursuant to the  screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, this Court , \nhowever, must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be \ninequitable or futile.  See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp ., 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).  Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint 3 must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the \nelements of a cause of action.\u201d  Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.  See Williams v. BASF  \nCatalysts LLC , 765 F.3d 306, 315 ( 3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \nand Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim \nhas substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A com plaint may \nnot be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See  id. \nat 10.   \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly  and Iqbal , a court reviewing the \nsufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1 ) take note of the elements the plaintiff must \nplead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, \nassume th eir veracity and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  \nSee Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016); see also Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is pl ausible will be a \u201ccontext -\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n A. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d  \n In Count I  Plaintiff alleges  that Defendant s Christiana Care Health Services, Inc. and \nChristiana Care Hospital  \u2013 Newark Campus  \u2013 Heart & Vascular Health Center  used \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s \n. . . person as a human pawn for five nights and four days without provi ding\u201d critical cardiac 4 medical care in a timely fashion \u201cby intentionally  discriminating \u201d based on Plaintiff\u2019s color, race \nand national origin in violation of 42 U.S.C. 2000d.  (D.I. 2 at 3 -4).  The Complaint  alleges that \nDefendants are recipients of federal funding .  The Complaint doe s not  reference Plaintiff\u2019s color, \nrace or  national origin.  \n Title  VI of the Civil Rights Act VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national \norigin by recipients of federal funding.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.  As pled, the Title VI c laims fail.   \nPlaintiff had not identified his protected class and the Title VI claim is alleged in a conclusory \nmanner.  Therefore, Count I will be dismissed.   \n B. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \nCounts II through V are raised pursuant to 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 1983 and allege violations of the  \nFourth, Ninth and Four teenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Count II specifically \nspeaks to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and is raised against all Defendants in their official capacities.  (D.I. 2 \nat 4).  Counts III, IV  and V incorporate facts from Co unt I and II , do not refer to \u00a7 1983, but do \nallege violations of Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.  Liberally  construing Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint as \nthe Court must, Plaintiff sues Defendants in their individual and official capacities  under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983. \nPlaintiff alleges that all Defendants are \u2018\u201cstate actors under color of state law\u2019 as the State \nof Delaware and the federal laws and statutes highly regulates the duties and responsibilities\u201d of \nDefendants.  (D.I. 2 at 4).  The Court takes judicial notice that all Defendants fall under the \numbrella of ChristianaCare, a private, not -for-profit regional health care system, http:// \nwww.christianacare.org (last visited Dec. 13, 2022). \nWhen bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has de prived him \nof a federal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law.  5 West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).  To act under \u201ccolor of state law\u201d a defendant must be \n\u201cclothed with the authority of state law.\u201d  West , 487 U.S. at 49.  As noted, all Defendants fall under \nthe umbrella of Christiana Care, a private not -for-profit regional health care system.  In addition, i t \nappears that the Doe Defendants are all employed by ChristianaCare.   The conclusory allegations \nthat Defendants are state actors does not suffice when none of the defendants are \u201cclothed with the \nauthority of state law.\u201d   See Henry v. Balas , No. 03- 771-GMS, 2004 WL 2211956, at *2 (D. Del. \nSept. 23, 2004) ( Christiana Health Services is a private corporati on and is not \u201c in any way\u201d  clothed \nwith the auth ority of state law).  \nTherefore, Counts II, III, IV and V will be dismissed.   \nC. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress  \nCount VI alleges that  Plaintiff  was subject to intentional infliction of emotional distress  as \na result of Defendants\u2019 actions.  (D.I. 2 at 10- 11).  Delaware applies Restatement (Second) of Torts \n\u00a7 46 in defining the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  See Cummings v. \nPinder , 574 A.2d 843, 845 (Del. 1990)  (per curiam).  That section imposes liability, in relevant \npart, on \u201c [o]ne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe \nemotional distress to another  . . . and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily  \nharm.\u201d   Outrageous conduct is \u201cconduct that exceeds the bounds of decency and is regarded as \nintolerable in a civilized community.\u201d   Goode v. Bayhealth Med. Ctr., Inc ., 931 A.2d 437, 2007 \nWL 2050761, at *2 (Del. July 18, 2007)  (Table) . \nCount VI  fails to s tate a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.   As ple aded , \nit cannot be said that Defendants are liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress.   Plaintiff \nwas provided medical care; but not in a manner that he found comfortable.  At most, and this is a 6 stretch, the alleged behavior may be negligent but it does not amount to conduct that \u201cexceeds the \nbounds of decency.\u201d   Therefore, Count VI will be dismissed. \nD. Vicarious Liability  \n Count VII alleges vicarious liability.  (D.I. 2 at 11- 12).  Plaintiff  alleges  that Christiana  \nCare Health Services, Inc. i s vicariously liable for the acts of its employees in providing medical \ncare.   Plaintiff\u2019s claim of vicarious liability/respondeat superior claim will be dismissed because \nall Counts and their underlying claims will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which \nrelief can be granted.  See Greco v. University  of Del ., 619 A.2d 900, 903 (Del. 1993) (\u201c[A] viable \ncause of action against the employee for negligence is a condi tion precedent to imputing vicarious \nliability for such negligence to the employer pursuant to the theory of respondeat superior.\u201d) ; \naccord Kolber  v. Body Cent. Corp., 967 F. Supp. 2d 1061, 1072 (D. Del. 2013) . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, th is Court will dismiss the C omplaint  pursuant 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii).  Plaintiff will be given leave to file an amended complaint.  \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nDAVID Q.
