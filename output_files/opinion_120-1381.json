The \nreport led DFS to open a neglect investigation and DFS caseworker Celeste Simmons  \nwas assigned to Dunsmore\u2019s case.  After meeting with Dunsmore and consulting with \nthose involved in her care, Simmons determined Dunsmore  needed additional support in \nparenting her baby .  Following the directives of the hospital and  Dunsmore \u2019s family \ninterventionist , Simmons facilitated her discharge to Bayard House, a residential program \nfor at-risk and homeless  young mothers .  Dunsmore  lived with her baby at the Bayard \nHouse until May  2019 , two months after DFS closed its case.

Before the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.  \nI.  Factual and Procedural History  \nUp until the time she gave birth to her son , Annamarie Dunsmore lived with her \nmother  Judith.2  Judith had a history of drug abuse and was struggling with her ongoing \naddiction to heroin before, during and after Dunsmore\u2019s pregnancy.  In June 2017, Judith \nsought family interventionist services from Wraparound Delaware , an organizati on that \noffers DFS home services to families referred by DSCYF .  Judith was incarcerated until \nSeptember 2017 , but the Wraparound family interventionist work ed closely with \nDunsmore and helped her develop life skills  while Judith was in prison .  When Dunsmore \nbecame pregnant, the family interventionist remained involved and helped her develop a \nplan for the pregnancy, which at times Dunsmore did not follow.  During the pregnancy, \nDunsmore\u2019s relationship with her mother became \u201cvery toxic\u201d and i nvolved  \u201ca lot of \narguing  and hostility between them\u201d until  \u201cthe friction between the two created an \nunhealthy environment\u201d for Dunsmore.  Joint Appendix  (\u201cJA\u201d) 684.  \nIn September 2018 , when Dunsmore was nine months pregnant, she told her \nmental health cou nselor Mariella Roberts that she had \u201clittle support \u201d in her life; her \n \n1  According to the Stipulated Facts filed by the parties, Defendant DSCYF conducts child \nwelfare investigations and services in the State of Delaware through  DFS.  In the \ncomplaint, Dunsmore explained that \u201cDSCYF\u2019s Division of Family Services (\u201cDFS\u201d) \nprotect s children from abuse and neglect in Delaware by assessing for potential abuse or \nneglect following a report.\u201d   D.I. 2, p.2.  \n \n2  Judith is referred to by her first name for clarity, and no disrespect or informality is \nintended.

She had \nno contact  with he r maternal grandfather, who reportedly abused  drugs, and her maternal \ngrandmother died in 2010.  Dunsmore had been emotionally abused and neglected by \nJudith, who left home when Dunsmore was four and returned only intermitten tly after \nthat point.  Dunsmore entered  foster care  at age nine , where she remained until 2016.  \nDunsmore reported she was in and out of a relationship with  DV, the eighteen -year-old \nfather of her baby.   DV was abusive towards Dunsmore and  had physically assaulted her \nin the past.   Id. at 376\u201377.  On October 1, 2018, Dunsmore told her counselor that Judith \nhad been getting high daily, and DV was \u201cmoving to Dover to live with [his] new \ngirlfriend.\u201d  Id. at 381.    \nThrough the Wraparound family interventionist, Dunsmore applied to live at the \nBayard House on October 12, 2018, five days before giving birth.  In the intake notes, \nBayard House reported  that Dunsmore was looking for housing because her home \u201cwas \nnot a safe environme nt for the baby \u201d due  to her mother \u201cusing drugs in the house.\u201d  Id. at \n353.  It further noted that she was not in a relationship with the father of the baby, and h er \n\u201c[c]ounselor and parent aid [were  her] only supports.\u201d    Id.  \nDunsmore gave birth on October 17, 2018,  at Christina Care Hospital  in Delaware .  \nTwo days after the delivery, hospital social worker Katherine Elizabeth Goemaat was \ncalled to conduct a \u201cfamily support, social assessment\u201d consult after  nursing staff  \nobserved  the parents engag ing in unsafe feeding and sleeping practices.   Id. at 436.  \nSpecifically, nurses saw the parents  asleep with the baby  despite repeatedly being told not Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 3 of 32 PageID #: 2494 \n4 \n to, and saw Dunsmore fi ll a bottle with unsterilized water to feed the baby.  During the \nconsult, Goemaat noted \u201cboth parents were looking at their phones almost the entire \ninterview.\u201d  Id.  They told Goemaat they were not in a relationship and planned  to move \nto separate locations  but neither could provide their new addresses.   Dunsmore ha d a \nlearner \u2019s permit but no car; she admitted that transportation would be difficult but stated \nthat \u201cWraparound workers can take her places. \u201d  Id.  Goemaat  concluded that both \nparents had  poor support systems: Dunsmore\u2019 s mother  was in detox, she had no friends \nthat could be \u201csupportive or helpful ,\u201d and her one supportive relative , an aunt,  lived in \nPennsylvania.  Id.  Following the meeting  Goemaat told hospital staff not to discharge  the \nbaby  until she spoke  to Dunsmore\u2019s Wraparound  family interventionist .  Id. \nLater that day , Goemaat spoke with Wraparound family interventionist  Lachrysta \nDublin, who informed her  that Dunsmore was \u201cactuall y supposed to move to Bayard \nHouse \u201d and \u201c would not be  living with baby independently.\u201d  Id.  In response to the raised \nsafety concerns, Dublin informed Goemaat  that Dunsmore has \u201c cognitive deficits, that \nshe graduated from [high school] with an [individual education plan], but [has] \ndifficulties processing new information.\u201d  Id.  After speaking with Dublin , Goemaat \nreiterated to hospital staff that the \u201cbaby [is] not to be discharged until [she]  speak [s] with \nBayard House and confirm [s] that they can take [ Dunsmore ] and baby ,\u201d and she \n\u201cconfirm [s] the level of supervision\u201d  provided by the program.   Id. at 436\u201337. \nGoemaat  informed Dunsmore that DFS would have to be notified of the safety \nconcerns  involving the baby .  She noted the parents loved their baby but \u201c are just unable \nto meet his needs safely at this time.\u201d  Id. at 435.  Goemaat  concluded the baby \u201ccannot Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 4 of 32 PageID #: 2495 \n5 \n be discharged to mom unless they are going Bayard House\u201d because \u201c[Dunsmore] lacks \nadequate support at home.\u201d  Id.  She then consulted with DFS employee  Shannon Brady , \nwho assisted  Dunsmore throughout her pregnancy .  Brady relayed that Dunsmore \u201c was \naware that if she did not utilize resources and education there was a risk that DFS would \nget involved ,\u201d and that she agreed  with the decision not to discharge  Duns more to her \nmother\u2019s home.  Id..   \nTrue to her word, Goem aat reported her concerns  regarding risk s to the baby\u2019s \nsafety to DFS .  Upon receipt of the report, a DFS intake worker utilize d the Structured \nDecision Making (SDM) Intake Screening tool to determine the appropriate  response.  \nThe SDM tool identifies the nature of the reported conduct  and defines the maltreatment \ntype and /or parental risk factor.  Once it is determined that the allegations warrant a \nresponse, t he SDM Priority R esponse tool determine s the urgency .  Id. at 277.   \nHere, a DFS intake worker documented Geomaat\u2019s report of Dunsmore\u2019s conduct \nand the SDM intake tool generated a maltreatment type of neglect, with a sub-\nmaltreatment type of neglect without inju ry and of basic needs: food/cloth ing and shelter.   \nThe intake worker , through the SDM intake tool, also identified certain parental risk \nfactor s.  The  primary risk factor  was Dunsmore\u2019s family history; specifically,  her \u201ctime \nspent in foster care, her lack of solid living and well -being plan for herself and her \nnewborn, and the instability of her mother\u2019s home, where she intended to live after giving Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 5 of 32 PageID #: 2496 \n6 \n birth.\u201d 3  Id. at 334.  A supplemental risk factor was also identified due the hospital\u2019 s \nreport of Dunsmore\u2019s \u201cpossible parental cognitive or other deficits. \u201d  Id. at 281, 334 .  \nAccording to the Deputy Director of DSCYF, cognitive functioning is not a determining \nfactor in maltreatment type, but it does determin e the urgency of the response time.  The \nintake worker assigned the report a priority 1 response, which required a  DFS caseworker \nto visit  in-person  within twenty -four hours.   Id. at 281. \nThe assigned DFS investigati ve caseworker was Defendant Celeste Simmons, who \nwent to the hospital on October 22, 201 8 to conduct a safety and risk assessment and \nbegin the investigation.  Simmons learned from hospital staff that Dunsmore had not been \ndischarged because they determined she required additional support , given that her \nmother was in detox  and her father was living in a motel temporarily .  Id.  The hospital \nhad also reported that Dunsmore had a cognitive delay and had an Individualized \nEducation Plan ( \u201cIEP\u201d) in high school.  Id. at 669.  Simmons met with Dunsmore and \nobserved she \u201chad to repeat things several times to ensure that [Dunsmore] understood \nwhat [was]  being said.\u201d  Id.  Dunsmore told Simmons  she h as mental health issues, and \nwas diagnosed with PTSD, ADD, depression and anxiety \u201cwhich comes from her \nmother\u2019s addiction.\u201d  Id. \nPrior to Dunsmore\u2019s discharge to the Bayard House, DFS social worker s Simmons  \nand Brady , hospital social worker  Goematt , and Wraparound family interventionist \n \n3 Judith had an open active treatment case with DFS because of  her mental health and \naddiction issues, and because she had a younger child who remained in foster care.  Id. at \n224.  \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 6 of 32 PageID #: 2497 \n7 \n Dublin all agreed that Dunsmore should be transferred  with her baby  to the Bayard \nHouse .  Dunsmore\u2019s mother Judith later testified that  Bayard House was a better option  \nthan her own apartment  post-delivery , given her ongoing struggles with heroin addiction .  \nSee id. at 140\u201341 (\u201cI went to rehab.  I said I can\u2019t use  . . .  I found out that it was better \nfor her to stay [at Bayard House] .  I just figured it was better for her to stay there. \u201d). \nDefendant Simmons and  Wraparound family interventionist Dublin  accompanied \nDunmore to the intake meeting at Bayard House, where  they discussed with Bayard\u2019s \nstaff what she need ed to do to ensure she maintained custody of her baby.  Dunsmore was \nadmitted  for a two-week  emergency stay, with the possibility she could extend her stay \nfor sixteen  months.  Simmons testified the \u201cdetermining factor\u201d in sending Dunsmore to \nthe Bayard House was \u201cnot having the support at home.\u201d  Id. at 69 (\u201c[B]ecause she didn\u2019t \nhave support, that is where we end it.\u201d) .  She called the people Dunsmore identified as \nsupport people to formulate a  \u201cback -up plan, \u201d but \u201cnone were deemed appr opriate by\u201d \nDFS.  Id. \nDunsmo re continued to see her mental health counselor during her stay at the \nBayard House.  On November 12, 201 8, she reported her mother had been clean from \nheroin for two weeks  and the father of the baby , who  was not involved or supportive , was \n\u201cfacing jail time [of] up to three years.\u201d  Id. at 387.  On November 20, 201 8, the \ncounselor noted that Dunsmore\u2019s symptoms of depression had improved, as they were \n\u201cless frequent or less intense.\u201d  Id. at 389.  On November 27, 2018, Simmons met with \nthe program manager of the Bayard House and nurse Suyen Estelow from the Healthy \nFamilies Delaware Program, who met with Dunsmore twice a week.  Simmons reported Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 7 of 32 PageID #: 2498 \n8 \n the baby was doing well , and the Program Manager felt D unsmore benefitted from the \nstructure and support  the House provided .  Id. at 686.   \nOn December 5, 2018, Simmons  conducted a risk assessment with Dunsmore and \nher baby at the Bayard House.  Under family history, Simmons reported that Dunsmore \nhad a history of DFS involvement as a child, that her mother has an open treatment case, \nand her younger brother was in foster care.  Id. at 672 .4  Simmons noted the baby had no \nhealth problems , and there were no concerns of child abuse or neglect .  Under the \u201crisk \nstatement\u201d heading , Simmons  wrote  harm may occur if \u201cmom continues to lack the \nappropriate skills and support to care for her baby.\u201d  Id. at 673 .5  Simmons recommend ed \nDunsmore  remain  at the Bayard House  and continue to work with  Healthy Families \nDelaware and the family interventionist at Wraparound Delaware.  Id.6 \nBased on the selections Simmons made when completing  the SDM Investigation \nRisk Assessment , the risk score generated in Dunsmore\u2019s case was \u201cmoderate ,\u201d which  \n \n4  According to DFS Deputy Director Susan Murray, MSW,  Dunsmore\u2019s history included \n\u201cinvolvement in twelve investigations as a child, six treatment cases, one permanency  case, \ntime in foster care, and ongoing therap eutic services for trauma and mental health needs.\u201d   \nId. at 335.  \n \n5  According to Director Murray, Simmons  conducted th e risk asse ssment  and noted \nDunsmore ha d difficulty  with cognitive function .  This was indicated in the \u201csupplemental \nrisk section,\u201d and \u201cis not part of the risk score calculation.\u201d  Id. at 338 .  Murray explained \nthat \u201ccaseworkers do no t use the SDM intake screening, risk assessment or safety \nassessment tools to assess parenting abilities.\u201d  Id.   \n \n6  Simmons noted that Dunsmore asked about going home, but Simmons did \u201c not feel \ncomfortable with allowing [Dunsmore] to be there without the needed supports.\u201d  Id. at \n685. \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 8 of 32 PageID #: 2499 \n9 \n generated the  recommendation t hat DFS close the investigation.   Id. at 674.  However, \nSimmons and her supervisor determined that Dunsmore\u2019s case called for a discretionary \noverrid e, given Dunsmore\u2019s extensive history with DFS, the information from the \nhospital intake form, and Dunsmore\u2019s  need for a support network .  Id. at 335 .  With the \ndiscretionary override of the SDM\u2019s risk score, the new risk score was \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery \nhigh.\u201d  Id.  According to Deputy  Director Murray, th e discretionary override and new risk \nscore \u201cindicated that Ms. Dunsmore could benefit from short -term asses sment and \nplanning to develop and solidify her plan for housing, childcare, and overall stability as a \nnew family.\u201d  Id.  According to Simmons \u2019 later testimony , Dunsmore\u2019s learning \ndisability was \u201cfactored in\u201d to the  discussion with her supervisor , but \u201cit was not the only \nfactor.\u201d   Id. at 75 .  Simmon s testified her  conclusion was not that Dunsmore had a \nlearning disability  but that the baby was not protected.  Id. at 76.  \n Approximately two months after Dunsmore gave birth, on December 11, 201 8, \nSimmons held a Family Team meeting at Bayard House to \u201cseek and discuss additional \nservices and/or resources for the family\u201d and \u201cto outline the next steps for [ Dunsmore ] \nand [her] baby.\u201d  Id. at 704 .  Present at the meeting was Dunsmore, Simmons,  \nDunsmore\u2019s parents ( her mother Judith via phone), Nurse Estelow with Healthy Families \nDelaware, representatives from Wraparound Delaware, representatives from DFS, and \nthe manager of Bayard House.  The focus of the meeting was the concern that Dunsmore \nlacked \u201c support and/or tools at home to provide the necessary safety needed to care for \nher child. \u201d  Id.  Also discussed  was Judith\u2019s long-term battle with addiction and her \ninconsistent drug treatment history .  The meeting\u2019s  goal was to develop a plan that would  Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 9 of 32 PageID #: 2500 \n10 \n prevent  Dunsmore from being subjected to \u201cthe behavior of her mom ,\u201d and instead \n\u201cobtain the skil ls necessary to be responsible\u201d and  live independently.  Id.  At the time of \nthe meeting, Dunsmore was enrolled in the Bayard House \u2019s transition program, was \nlooking for a job, and was  scheduled  start college in January 2019.  She was also enrolled \nin the Healthy Family D elaware  Program, where she learned \u201c the skill s of being a new \nmom. \u201d  Id.  Dunsmore would continue to receive bi -weekly visits from Nurse Estelow \nand additional services from Wraparound  Delaware .  Id.   \nAccording to Simmons\u2019 summary  of the meeting, the participants  decided that \nDunsmore  was to remain at the Bayard House while she continued her efforts to  find \nchildcare, hous ing, and a job.  S he would continue  with therapy  and resume her \nmedications.  She was scheduled to start college in January  2019 .  Id.  Simmons would \nbuy Dunsmore  a bus pass , and it was agreed that a ll of the agencies involved \u201cwill use the \ngoals identified to make their goals/treatment plan .\u201d  Id.  Finally, staff members from  \nWrap around and the Bayard House commended Dunsmore  \u201cfor making progress and \ndoing very well with re -direction.\u201d Id.7  \nOn December 20, 2018, Simmons close d the investigation case with a finding of \n\u201cunsubstantiated with concern. \u201d  Id. at 676 .  The treatment case, however,  continued with \nservices, due to the  concerns and risk factors of \u201clack of parenting skills and supports.\u201d  \n \n7  Dunsmore stayed with her baby at the Bayard House until May 2019,  two months after \nDFS closed its treatment case .  There is no indication on the record that Dunsmore \u2019s stay \npast DFS\u2019s involvement  was anything but her decision .  On the Bayard House  discharge \nform  dated May 29, 2019, a staff member reported Dunsmore was leaving because \u201cshe \ndid not want to live there anymore\u201d and planned to leave the following week  in order \u201cto \ngive her time to gather [the] necessary resources for herself and [her baby].\u201d  Id. at 358.

At her counseling session the next day, Dunsmore reported that she was \nregistering for college , visiting day care centers and  attending parenting classes.  She \nreported that the baby\u2019s father, DV, was in jail.  Dunsmore was sad , but her feelings of \nworthle ssness had lessened,  and she was experienc ing fewer crying spells.  Id. at 400 .  \nThe following week, Dunsmore reported that she was adapting to Bayard House  and \n\u201cfeeling more connected to [her] roommates.\u201d  Id. at 402.  She was starting online classes \nthe following week , and reported less anhedonia, excessive worrying, and irritability.   Id.  \nOn March 29, 2019 , DFS closed Dunsmore\u2019s treatment case.  Despite the absence \nof DFS involvement, Dunsmore and her baby stayed at the Bayard House  for another two \nmonths.  On  May 29, 2019 , Dunsmore  left Bayard House to move in with a family \nmember.   Id. at 358.  In her later testimony, Dunsmore stated she moved in with a cousin \nrather than her mother because \u201cthat\u2019s what started everything in the first place.\u201d  Id. at \n109.  Dunsmore testified that she left Bayard House  because she \u201cfelt [she] did not \nreceive the s upport that they were trying to give off in their image.\u201d   Id. at 108.  She did \neventually move back in with her mother, but th at arrangement ended when the two \nwomen filed protection from abuse orders against one another.   Id. at 144\u201345.   \nDunsmore filed this action on October 13, 2020.  She asserts DSCYF violat ed \nTitle II of the American with Disabilities Act (the ADA) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act (Section 504),  caseworker Simmons violat ed her  Fourteenth \nAmendment  rights pursua nt to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that both Defendants violated her \ndue process rights under  Article I \u00a7 7 of the Delaware Constitution .

She alleges DSCYF failed to assess \nwhether she was in fact a parent with cognitive disabilities, choosing instead to keep an \ninvestigation against h er open  for months while  forcing her to live in a homeless shelter.

Indeed, s uch a \ncontention would be baseless.  A parent with a disability  can pose \u201ca significant risk to \nthe health or safety of the child that cannot be eliminated by reasonable modification ,\u201d \nand recognition of a parent\u2019s disability does not constitute discrimina tion under the ADA \nand Section 504.  Technical Assistance, p. 5.  Dunsmore  instead claims  Defendants  \nassumed her perceived learning  disability  limited  her ability to care for her baby  as \ncompared to people  without disabilities , see Deane  v. Pocono Med ical Center , 142 F.3d \n138, 143 (3d Cir. 1998) , and this assumption  caused the agency to proscrib e an \ninappropriately intrusive service .  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1210 2(1)(A), (C).  In this instance, \nthe alleged  discrimination w as placing Dunsmore in Bayard House based on  the \nassumption  her learning disability rendered her unable to safely parent on her ow n.11  \n \n10  Dunsmore argues she qualifies under the ADA and S ection 504 as a disabled person \nbecause she has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder, anxiety , and depression.  Defendants counter that  she failed to \nsubmit evidence that these conditions interfered with her major life activities.  See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1).  Regardless, Dunsmore  does not claim these disabilities were the basis \nof any discrimination  by DSCYF,  and so any discussion as to whether these impairments \nqualify as d isabilities  under the ADA and Section 504  is irrelevant .  \n \n11  Dunsmore \u2019s purported learning disabilit y was referenced throughout the record by the \nDefendants and others involved in her and her baby\u2019s care .  The Court agree s with Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 15 of 32 PageID #: 2506 \n16 \n Dunsmore believes that , had she not been discriminated against  for her perceived \ndisability , DSCYF would have provided child welfare services to her and her baby while \nshe lived with  her mother.  \nThe mission of DSCYF is to \u201c[e]ngage families and communities to promote the \nsafety and well -being of children through prevention, intervention, treatment and \nrehabilitative services. \u201d  https://kids.delaware.gov/about/ .  In her complaint, Dunsmore \nalleged DSCYF , through the agency DFS, \u201cprotects children from abuse and neglect in \nDelaware by assessing for potential abuse or neglect following a report.\u201d  D.I. 2 , p.2.  \nDSYCF is therefore tasked with protecting children, not the parents.  In achieving this \nmission, however, DSC YF cannot dis criminate against the parents of the children  it seeks \nto protect .  It is important to note that DSCYF and Simmons did not find it necessary to \nremove the baby from Dunsmore\u2019s care; she  instead alleges assumptions about her \nperceived  disability  led to DSCYF\u2019s conclusion that she needed additional support to \nensure  the baby\u2019s safety . \nThe Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 \npublication provides this Court with guidance on how to determin e whether DSCYF \ndiscriminat ed against Dunsmore .  See In re H.C. , 187 A.3d 1254, 1265 (D.C. 2018)  \n(citing DOJ/HHS Technical Assistance , p.1) (publication \u201cto assist state and local child \n \nDefendants that Kelly v.

Here, the Court finds the record could sustain \na finding that  Defendants perceived Dunsmore  as having a learning disability , and her \ndisability was taking into consideration in deciding DSCYF \u2019s course of action .  Again, the \nissue before the Court is whether that consideration resulted in discrimination .

They are: \u201c(1) indiv idualized treatment; and (2) full and equal \nopportunit y.\u201d  Id.

While a state \nagency may impose legitimate safety requirements  when providing services , \u201cthey may \nnot be based on stereotypes and generalizations about persons with disabilities.\u201d   Id. at 5.  \nFull and fair opportunity requires that disabled individuals  are \u201cprovided opportunities to \nbenefit from or participate in child welfare programs, ser vices, and activities that are \nequal to those extended to individuals without disabilities.\u201d   Id.  To achieve this goal, \nchild welfare agencies must make \u201creasonable changes \u201d to their services to accommodate \nthe needs of the disabled person.  Id.; In re H.C. , 187 A.3d at 1266.  \nIn arguing for summary judgment, DSCYF claims  Dunsmore  was discharged to \nBayard House because : (1) she had applied to live there prior to giving birth because she \nrecognized her need  for secure housing , and (2) hospital staff witnessed her engage in \nunsafe childcare practice s and would not discharg e the baby unless she  stayed at Bayard \nHouse .  Defendants argue that DSCYF, through its employee Simmons , made an \nindividualized assessment  of Dunsmore\u2019s circumstances and mitigated safety risk s facing \nthe baby by providing her with support, services , and a safe place to live.  DSCYF Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 17 of 32 PageID #: 2508 \n18 \n contends Dunsmore continued to reside at the Bayard House while the DFS investigation \nwas ongoing because her home life remained uns table  and her need for external support \ncontinued .  Her  mother \u2019s struggle with heroin continued and, two months after giving \nbirth, Dunsmore  \u201cdid not have the tools and resources to provide a safe place/space for \nher child.\u201d  JA 704.  Finally, DSCYF point s out Dunsmore willingly stayed at the Bayard \nHouse  two months  after DFS closed its treatment case and, when she did return to her \nmother\u2019s apartment, the living arrangement prove d to be  unmanageable . 12 \nIn response  to Defendants \u2019 motion,  Dunsmore posits that DSCYF  perceived her as \nhaving cognitive delays  and, rather than perform \u201can objective evaluation of her \nparenting capabilities,\u201d sent her to Bayard House based on the assumption that she was \ntoo disabled to parent alone.   AB, p.13.  Dunsmore argues there was no evidence in the \nrecord of her parenting defi cits, aside from the hospital  staff\u2019s reports of unsterilized tap \nwater in the baby\u2019s bottle and repeatedly co-sleeping with the infant.   AB, p.12.  She \nfurther claims there was no evidence that living with her mother posed an immediate risk \nto the baby  and Defendants \u2019 assum ption that the situation was unsafe was \u201cinformed by \nthe perception of her disability.\u201d   AB, p.13.     \nTo deny summary judgment,  this Court would  have to find that a genuine dispute \nexits as to whether DSCYF  facilitated Dunsmore \u2019s stay  at Bayard House because it  made \n \n12  According to her mother\u2019s testimony, Dunsmore moved in with her after leaving the \nBayard House while waiting for a housing voucher.  In the following months  Dunsmore \nfiled a protection order against her mother, and her mother then filed one against her.  A t \nthe time of Judith Dunsmore\u2019s testimony, the two  no longer had contact with one another.  \nJA 144\u201345.  \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 18 of 32 PageID #: 2509 \n19 \n assumptions about her  perceived disability  and presumed it was prima facie evidence  that \nshe was unfit to  parent  without support .  See Arneson v. Arneson , 670 N.W.  2d 904 , 912\u2013\n13 (N.D.  2003).  This Court finds no genuine dispute exists .  Dunsmore received \nindividualized treatment ; the particular facts of her circumstances led DSYCF and the \nother agencies involved to determine that the Bayard House was necessary to ensure the \nbaby\u2019s safety.  The Court agrees with DSCYF  that caseworker Simmons reached this \nconclusion  in part  because  Dunsmore \u2019s family interventionist informed her that \nDunsmore  arranged to stay at Bayard House before giving birth, stating that her home \nwas not a s afe environment  due to her mother\u2019s on -going drug use . 13  Also relevant to \nSimmons\u2019 conclusion was her consultation  with the hospital social worker, who stated \nthe baby would only be discharged if Dunsmore  followed the plan to live temporarily at \nthe Bayard Hous e.  See JA 435 (\u201cBecause [mother of baby] lacks adequate support at \nhome, baby cannot be discharged to mom unless they are going to Bayard House.\u201d) .  The \nBayard House intake form stated that Dunsmore \u201cwas precluded from returning to her \nprevious residence where she resided with her mother due to inadequate living \n \n13 Dunsmore \u2019s testimony  that she did not remember applying to the Bayard House  does not \ncreate a genuine dispute of fact .  See Anderson , 477  U.S. 242 at 247 \u201348.  Rather, the \nmaterial facts here concern  whether DSCYF \u2019s insistence on Dunsmore\u2019s stay at the  Bayard \nHouse was due to  assumptions  about her perceived disability.  Because Dunsmore\u2019s \ntestimony that she does not remember is not case -determinative, a dispute over whether \nshe filled out the intake form  is not of the nature that overcomes a motion for summary \njudgment.  See id.   \n \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 19 of 32 PageID #: 2510 \n20 \n conditions, parentification and the family\u2019s open cases with [DFS].\u201d  Id. at 357.  Notably, \nthere was no mention of her perceived learning disability  anywhere on the form . \nDunsmore  contends misperceptions of her learning disability caused DSCYF to \nfacilitate the discharge to the Bayard House, but the record does not support  that \ncontention.  The Bayard House is for homeless  and at -risk young mothers , not for young \nmothers with  learning disabilities .  While Simmons and other service providers \nrecognized the need to repeat information or instructions to Dunsmore, there is no \nindication on the record that the Bayard House was the proposed solution to any \nperceived cognitive deficit .  Instead, Simmons and the others involved in her care \nattributed Dunsmore\u2019s lack of parenting skills and the absence of familial support  to her \ntumultuous upbringing , and th e Bayard House  placement  was to support her in those \nareas.   In December 2018, Simmons observed:  \nOverall, Ann a[marie] i s [a] smart young lady who does need extra support [].  \nWith Anna [marie]  being parentified as a child, there were life skills she did \nnot receive.  Anna [marie]  has been in the DFS system as a child but I believe \nshe can benefit from the division and the services offered as an adult.  \nAnna [marie]  will gain independence and lear n to value herself if she \ncontinues to reside at the Bayard House and receive the supports offered.  \n \nId. at 684.  \nThat Dunsmore believes it would have been more appropriate  for her to receive \nservices at her mother\u2019s home does not amount to evidence of discrimination.  She argue s \nSimmons erred by not conferring with  Nurse Estelow, who testified  that the Bayard Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 20 of 32 PageID #: 2511 \n21 \n House was not the \u201cbest choice\u201d for Dunsmore.14  According to Estelow, t he better \nchoice would have been \u201c[t]o continue home visiting services\u201d because she \u201cdid n\u2019t see \nhow, if [Dunsmore ] had a n intellectual disability, [how]  putting her in a homeless shelter \nwould be a resolution to that.\u201d  Id. at 173.  But Dunsmore was not discharged to the \nBayard House to resolve a learning disability , she was sent to resolve the issue of not \nhaving reliable support and a safe environment for the baby.  Id. at 353.  Estelow  \ndisagreed with the extent of DSCYF\u2019s involvement but  acknowledged Dunsmore \u2019s need \nfor support services  because she  had limited familial support .  Estelow recognized  \nDunsmore\u2019s  mother  was in drug treatment  and Dunsmore herself felt \u201cshe would b e \nbetter off on her own.\u201d  Id. at 176, 178.   Also relevant is that Estelow met with \nDunsmore at her mother\u2019s house during the day , before she and her  baby would return to \nBayard House  to sleep .  Id. at 178.  The fact  that Dunsmore spent her days at her \nmother\u2019s house supports DSYCF\u2019s position that her placement  at the Bayard House was \nto provide  secure housing , not to address a learning disability that rendered her unable to \nparent .  Estelow\u2019s  visits, albeit frequent and fruitful, could  not provide what the Bayard \nHouse did \u2014a secure place to live away from  the tumult and instability caused by \nDunsmore\u2019s mother  and her heroin addiction .15  DSCYF\u2019s reason s for perpetuating \n \n14  The record does not support Dunsmore\u2019s contention that Simmons never conferred \nwith Estelow.  Simmons did but  disagreed with Estelow\u2019s assessment of Dunsmore\u2019s  \nhome situation.  See id. at 73, 685, 704. \n \n15  Estelow acknowledge d the role the Bayard House played in Dunsmore\u2019s care.  After the \nDecember 11, 2019 , meeting, Estelow reported that Simmons concluded Dunsmore  \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 21 of 32 PageID #: 2512 \n22 \n Dunsmore\u2019s stay at Bayard House  were expressed at the December 2019  meeting , when \nSimmons  observed she should remain out of concern  that \u201cshe will not have the tools  and \nresources to provide a safe place/ space for her child\u201d  if she lives with her mother.   Id. \n704.  While Simmons may have considered Dunsmore\u2019s  perceived learning disability  in \ndeciding on this course of action , no reasonable factfinder  could conclude that  \nassumptions about her perceived disability propelled DSCYF\u2019s conclusion that the  \nBayard House remained  necessary.  \nUnder Dunsmore\u2019s theory of the case, assumptions  about her learning disability \nwould have resulted in her discharg e to the Bayard House regardless of whether she had a \nstable, safe home environment and viable sources of support.  The record does not \nsupport this finding .  Although b oth Simmons and the Wraparound  family interventionist \nobserved Dunsmore needed instructions repeated  before understand ing them , id. at 71 & \n436, the record establishes it was her need for life skills and familial support  that served \nas the basis for the Bayard House plan .16  Dunsmore  supports her claim of discrimination \n \nis at risk to return home because her mother is inconsistent with methadone \ntreatment.  [Dunsmore] is remanded back to the B ayard House with her baby \nuntil she can obtain housing awa y from her mother.  [Dunsmore] and her \nmother stated they disagreed with t he plan, however, [Dun smore] state d she \nwill comply so that she can obtain any additional resources offered.  \n \nId. at 522.  At a visit on January 1, 2019, Estelow reported Dunsmore \u201clives in a homeless \nshelter because of her mother\u2019s battle with sobriety in the past.\u201d  Id. at 549.     \n \n16  Dunsmore claims that nothing on the record shows that Simmons determined \u201cwhether \nthe learning disability indicated a cognitive  disability.\u201d  AB, p.7.  She does not explain how \nsuch a distinction would be relevant to Simmons formulating a plan to ensure  the safety of \nthe baby.   \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 22 of 32 PageID #: 2513 \n23 \n by asserting her mental health counselor did not believe she had a learning disability.   \nSee, e.g., AB, p p.9, 15, 17.   But the counselor\u2019s report supports , rather than detracts, \nfrom  DSCYF\u2019s decided course of action  as nondiscriminatory .  The counselor  reported \nthat living with her mother , as she continued her struggle with heroin addiction , posed a \nserious threat to Dunsmore\u2019s mental health .  She opined  Dunsmore\u2019s \u201cmain issues\u201d were \nher \u201canxiety  [and]  history of PTSD associated to her mother\u2019s drug addiction.\u201d  JA 1243.  \nTasked with keeping Dunsmore\u2019s baby safe , DSCYF required that she spend the baby\u2019s \nfirst months away from her mother , who posed the  biggest threat to her mental health .  \nHer counselor reported  Dunsmore could benefit from additional services in the areas of \neducation, childcare, and \u201cstable housing.\u201d  Id. at 1244.  Stable housing is precisely what \nDefendant s sought  to provide  with the Bayard House .17 \n \nDunsmore also alleges Simmons erred by failing to ascertain the  precise  nature of her \nlearning disability through assessments.  She does not specify what kind of assessment s, \nwhat the assessments would entail, or how the r esult of these assessments would change \nSimmons\u2019 observations that Dunsmore needed  familial support and a safe environment for \nthe baby.   Further, Dunsmore provides no law to support her claim that \u201cassessments ,\u201d \nrather than the in -person meetings with her  and consulting with other the agencies \ninvolved , were necessary to satisfy the \u201cindividualized treatment \u201d prong under the ADA \nand Section 504.  \n \n17  The Court recognizes that Dunsmore\u2019s expert Nicole Brisson testified that DSCYF erred \nby not properly assessing her learning disability and was therefore unable to appropriately \naccommodate her.  See AB, p. 10.  But DFS deemed any learning disability a s ub-risk factor, \nnot the primary risk factor.  The primary risk factor was Dunsmore\u2019s lack of secure \nhousing, which Simmons addressed by mandating her stay at the Bayard House.  Simmons\u2019 \nassessment of Dunsmore\u2019s perceived learning disability was that she ne eded information \nrepeated.  There is no evidence Dunsmore required more than the repetition of information \nor that the services she received were not modified to meet her perceived disability.   \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 23 of 32 PageID #: 2514 \n24 \n DSCY F\u2019s insistence on secure housing  while  Dunsmore  maintain ed custody of her \nbaby  did not constitute an act of discrimination .  A violation of the ADA and Section 504 \ncould have occur red if DSYCF failed to treat Dunsmore as an individual and insisted on \nhousing because of  her perceived disability.  See In re H.C. , 187 A.3d at 1266; DOJ/HH S \nTechnical Assistance, p. 5.  Here, Dunsmore received a multitude of services:  housing, \nchildcare, mental health services, medical treatment, parenting skills training, education, \ntransportation costs, and assistance with finding a job.  Her claim that  she did not receive \nthese services in her mother\u2019s home  because  of her perceived learning d isability is \nunsupported by a preponderance of the  evidence .  The record instead establishe s that \nDSYCF, in serving the best interests of the baby , acted out of concern that Dunsmore \nlacked  skills and secure housing due to family circumstances .  This Court finds that \nDSCYF employee Simmons  imposed legitimate requirements for the baby \u2019s safety  that \nwere not based on stereotypes or generalizations about Dunsmore\u2019s  perceived disability.  \nAccordingly, t he Court will grant summary judgment for DSCYF. 18   \n  \n \n18  See Bartell v.

Jeannot v. Phila . Housing Auth ., \n356 F. Supp.  3d 440 , 451 (E.D.  Pa. 2018) .  Here, Dunsmore claims  Simmons discharged \nher to the Bayard House because she was perceived to be disabl ed.  But a person with a \nperceived or actual disability is not a member of a suspect class.  City of Cleburne v. Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 25 of 32 PageID #: 2516 \n26 \n Cleburne Living Ctr. , 473 U.S. 432, 445 \u201346 (1985) .19  Dunsmore \u2019s assertio n Simmons \ninterfered with a fundamental right  also fails .  In a footnote, Dunsmore  cites Troxel v. \nGranville , 530 U.S. 57 (2000) and argues  her case invokes a \u201cparent\u2019s right to make \ndecisions regarding the care of her child .\u201d  AB, p.14 n.8.  But the Third Circuit has \nexplicitly held  that the right enunciated in Troxel is not violated when the state \ntemporarily remove s a child from a mother\u2019s custody .  See Mammaro v. New Jersey Div. \nof Child Pro tection and Permanency , 814 F.3d 164, 170 (3d Cir. 2016) .  Here, Dunsmore \nmaintained custody of her child, which means the right enunciated  in Troxel is not \napplicable.   Dunsmore \u2019s only avenue of relief , therefore,  is to plead a \u201cclass -of-one\u201d \nequal protection claim .  To plead such a claim, Dunsmore  must allege : (1) Simmons  \ntreated h er differently from other  non-disabled young mother s similarly situated, (2) that \nSimmons did so intentionally, and (3) there was no rational basis for the difference in \ntreatment.   Id. (citing  Hill v. Borough of Kutztown , 455 F.3d 225, 239 (3d Cir. 2006) ).  \nThis Court  agree s with Simmons  that Dunsmore failed to  adequately plead  a class -\nof-one claim .  \u201cSimilarly situated \u201d here would mean a young mother who lacks familial \nsupport and secure housing who DFS c ontacted after the hospital filed a report of \nneglectful  conduct .  Duns more  posits  Estelow\u2019s testimony  establishe d the first element \nbecause Estelow averred that, in her experience,  incidents of unsafe feeding  and sleeping  \npractices did not require DFS involvement .  She testified that , for other young mothers , \n \n19  Dunsmore\u2019s complaint does not acknowledge that having a disability does not place he r \nin a suspect class .  As a result, the complaint does not posit the \u201cclass -of-one\u201d theory and \ndoes not allege that she was intentionally treated from others similarly situated.   D.I. 2  \u00b6\u00b6 \n90\u201398. Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 26 of 32 PageID #: 2517 \n27 \n such incidents were  treated as \u201cteachable moments\u201d  and nursing programs like hers \nwould step in to provide the necessary skills .  AB, p. 14.  While the law in the Third \nCircuit does not require the comparators  to be  identical , they must be alike in all relevant \naspects to be similarly situated under the Equal Protection Clause.   Borrell v. Bloomsburg \nUniversity , 955 F.  Supp.  2d 390, 405 ( M.D. P a. 2013)  (internal quotations and citations \nomitted) .  There is no indication that the other mothers reference d in Estelow\u2019s  testimony  \nhad family  circumstances similar  to Dunsmore\u2019s .  It is beyond question that Dunsmore\u2019s \nabsolute lack of familial support was relevant  to the plan Simmons  implemented to \nmitigate  safety  risks to her baby .  Also relevant  was the hospital \u2019s refus al to discharge \nDunsmore\u2019s  baby unless Simmons provided secure housing for both mother and child .  \nEstelow\u2019s testimony  failed to identify non-disabled  mothers that shared  these relevant \naspects , and therefore failed to  establish  similarly situat ed comparators to support  \nDunsmore\u2019s  equal protection claim .20  See Jeannot, 356 F.  Supp.  3d at 451.   Because \nDunsmore did not sufficiently allege  she was deprived of her equal protection  rights , \nSimmons is entitled to summary judgment on this claim . \n \n20  Dunsmore also alleges th ere was no rational basis for the difference in treatment s he and \nother  non-disabled similarly situated young mothers received.  The record does not support \nthis allegation.  It was not irrational for Simmons , given Dunsmore \u2019s familial \ncircumstances,  to adhere to  the hospital\u2019s requirement that Dunsmore reside at the Bayard \nHouse.  It was not irrational for Simmons to agree with Dunsmore\u2019s family interventionist \nthat she needed additional supports and secure house to safely parent her child.  That \nDunsmore disagre es whether her extended stay at Bayard House was warranted does not \nrender Simmons\u2019 actions irrational.   Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 27 of 32 PageID #: 2518 \n28 \n    \nii. Substantive Due Process Claim  \n \nSimmons argues Dunsmore\u2019s substantive due process claim  fails because she \nfailed to establish  her discharge to the Bayard House was arbitrary and shocked the \nconscience .  As with her other claims, Dunsmore  asserts that a preponderance of the \nevidence establishes her perceived learning disability was the improper basis for her \nmandated stay at the shelter.   Because the record does not support this assertion , the \nCourt will grant Simmons summary judgment  on this claim  as well .  \n\u201cIn bringing a substantive due process claim, one alleges the government has \nabused its power in an arbitrary manner that \u2018shocks the conscience.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 169 \n(quoting Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis , 523 U.S. 833, 846 \u201348 (1998)).  In this case, \nDunsmore claim s Simmons  violated her fundamental liberty interest in \u201cremaining \ntogether with her child, in maintaining custody of her child, and in deciding how and \nwhere to raise her child.\u201d   D.I. 2 \u00b6 102.   Dunsmore alleges Simmons violated her right to \nfamily integrity when she ordered Dunsmore  to reside at the Bayard House because of \nher perceived learning disability or risk  losing custody of her baby.     \nBut the Supreme Court has never held this right to \u201c familial integrity\u201d is absolute \nor unqualified but  is instead balanced \u201cagainst the compelling government interest in the \nhealth, education and welfare of children as future citizens.\u201d   Callahan , 880 F.  Supp. at \n328.  Given  a parent\u2019s  interest in car ing for the child is balanced against the state\u2019s \ninterest in protecti ng the child , it is difficult to ascertain what  a parent\u2019s clearly \nestablished rights are when a state social worker is investigating for neglect.  Id. at 329.  Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 28 of 32 PageID #: 2519 \n29 \n As the Third Circuit held in Mammaro , there is no clearly established right preventing the \nstate from temporarily remov ing a child  from a parent\u2019s custody .  But even in the absence \nof a clearly established right,  state social workers must still have \u201csome reasonable and \narticulable evidence \u201d supporting the state\u2019s conduct  or the action could be deemed \u201can \narbitrary abuse of government power.\u201d   Mammaro, 814 F.3d at 170 (quoting Croft v. \nWestmoreland C nty. Children and Youth Ser vs., 103 F.3d 1123, 112 4 (3d Cir. 1997)) . \nEven assuming the right articulated in her c omplaint could be deemed clearly \nestablished , Dunsmore never lost custody of her baby .  The  right to remain with her child  \nand decide how to raise her child was therefore  never violated.  The state  temporarily \ninterfered with \u201cwhere\u201d she raised her child , but only for evenings and nights \u2014she was \nable to spend her days at her mother\u2019s apartment .  Given Mammaro, the state\u2019s  temporary \nplacement of mother and baby in a shelter could not constitute a violation of a clearly \nestablished right .  Despite the absence of a right, Dunsmore  insist s the placement \nconstituted an arbitrary abuse of power because it was  motivated by  assumptions about \nher perceived learning disability .  As no ted earlier, this contention is not supported by the \nrecord.    \nFar from arbitrary, Simmons\u2019 decision to discharge Dunsmore to the Bayard \nHouse \u2014a decision mandated  by the hospital and supported by Dunsmore\u2019s family \ninterventionist \u2014was based on her assessment that Dunsmore needed support and secure \nhousing .  After learning of Dunsmore\u2019s circumstances, Simmons determined both were \nnecessary to ensure the baby\u2019s safety .  Although  Simmons may have considered her own \nassessment that Dunsmore had learning disabilities, that  did not render her decision an Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 29 of 32 PageID #: 2520 \n30 \n abuse of government power.  The record could not support a finding that Simmons , \nresponsible for keeping the days -old infant safe,  acted in a manner that shocked the \nconscience.   Accordingly, this Court will grant  Simmons summary judgment  on th e due \nprocess claim .  \n C.  State Constitutional  Claims  \n Finally, Dunsmore raises claim s under Article I, \u00a7 7 of the Delaware Cons titution  \nalleging Defendants DSCYF and Sim mons violated her Delaware due process rights .  \nThis Court finds that this claim  is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the \nState Torts Claim Act ( STCA ), 10 Del. C.  \u00a7 4001.   \nRegarding  DSYCF, this Court finds the agency is immune from civil liability \nunder the doctrine of sovereign immunity pursuant to the Delaware Const itution.  \u201c[T]he \ndoctrine of sovereign immunity provides that the State may not be sued without its \nconsent.\u201d   Doe v. Cates , 499 A.2d 1175, 1176 (Del. 1985).  In order to overcome \nDelaware\u2019s  sovereign immunity: 1) the state must waive immunity, and 2) the STCA \nmust not otherwise bar the action.  Id. at 1176 \u201377.  Dunsmore does not contest that this \ndoctrine applies to DSCYF.  This Court sees no evidence DSYCF waived its immunity , \nor that this lawsuit is not barred  by the  STCA.   As a result, the Court will gr ant summary \njudgment in favor of DSYCF on this claim.   \nWhether Simmons is entitled to such immunity requires more analysis,  but the \nresult is the same.  When state actors or employees are sued in their individual capacities, \nthey are exempt from liability pursuant to the STCA when: (1) the alleged act or failure \nto act arises out of and in connection with the performance of official duties involving the Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 30 of 32 PageID #: 2521 \n31 \n exercise  of discretion; (2) the act (or failure to act ) was done in good faith; and (3) the act \n(or failure to act ) was done without gross negligence.   See 10 Del. C.  \u00a7 4001 .  A plaintiff \nneed only prove the absence of one of these elements to defeat qualified imm unity.   Id. \n(\u201c[T]he plaintiff shall have the burden of proving the absence of 1 or more of the \nelements of immunity as set forth in this section.\u201d) ; see also Browne v. Robb , 538 A.2d \n949, 952 (Del. 1990) . \nIf this Court determines Simmons\u2019 alleged violative conduct involved \ndiscretionary acts, then Dunsmore\u2019s claims \u201care barred by qualified immunity unless she \ncan prove that the defendant \u2019s acted in bad faith  or gross negligence.\u201d  J.L. v. Barnes , 33 \nA.3d 902, 914 (Del. Super. 2011).  Under Delaware law, conduct is deemed  discretionary \nwhen \u201cthere is no hard and fast rule as to [the] course of conduct that one must or must \nnot take.\u201d   Id. (quoting Estate of Martin v. State , 2001 WL  112100, at *5 (Del.  Super.  \nJan. 17, 2001 )) (brackets in original) . \nHere, Dunsmore\u2019s allegations against Simmons arise from \u201cin-the-field decisions\u201d \nshe made when developing an appropriate plan to protect the  baby.  These decisions were \ncertainly discretionary, and therefore Simmons would enjoy qualified immunity unless \nshe engaged in \u201cwi llful, reckless, or grossly negligent behavior.\u201d   Id. at 914.  Nothing on \nthe record supports that Simmons acted in such a manner.  The Third Circuit recognizes \nthat social workers investigating child  welfare cases \u201cmust make difficult decisions based \non imperfect information ,\u201d and weigh  the rights of the parent aga inst the rights of the \nchild, while also addressing  the threat to the child\u2019s safety .  Mammaro , 814 F.3d at 171.  \nIt is because of these circumstances  that caseworkers are protected from suit.   See Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 31 of 32 PageID #: 2522 \n32 \n Greenfi eld as Next Friend for Ford v. Miles , 211 A.3d 1087, 1102 (Del. 2019) ( holding \nstate child -welfare caseworker  was entitled to qualified immunity under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 \n4001  because caseworker\u2019s discretionary acts d id not support a finding of gross \nnegligence ).  While it may be  Dunsmore disagreed with the plan Simmons  implemented , \nthe record in no way  establishes  Simmons\u2019 course of conduct constitute d gross \nnegligence.   \nV.   Conclusion  \n For all the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the Defendants\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.   \nAn appropriate order will be entered.  \n Case 1:20-cv-01381-LFR   Document 88   Filed 08/04/22   Page 32 of 32 PageID #: 2523"}
