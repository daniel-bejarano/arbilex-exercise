Stark", "date": "12-06-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSARA WHITE DOVE-RIDGEWAY , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nKILOLO KIJAKAZI, \nCommissioner of Social Security, 1 \nDefendant. C.A. No. 19-35-LPS-MPT \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nWHEREAS, Chief Magistrate Judge Thynge issued a 17-page Report and \nRecommendation (the \"Report\") (D.I. 36), dated May 7, 2021, recommending that the Court \ndeny Plaintiff Sara White Dove-Ridgeway' s (\"Plaintiff ' or \"Dove-Ridgeway\") motion for \nattorneys' fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) (D.I. \n31);2 \nWHEREAS, on May 21, Dove-Ridgeway objected to the Report (\"Objections\") (D.I. 37); \nWHEREAS, on June 3, Defendant Kilolo Kijakazi (\"Defendant\" or \"Commissioner\") \nresponded to Dove-Ridgeway's Objections (\"Response\") (D.I. 38); \n1 Kilolo Kijakazi replaced Andrew Saul as Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021 and \nis automatically substituted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25( d). (See D.I. 43 at 1 \nn.l) \n2 Dove-Ridgeway also filed a motion for attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) of the \nSocial Security Act on November 18, 2021. (D.I. 41) The Commissioner \"neither supports nor \nopposes\" that request. (D.I. 44 at 1) Judge Thynge issued a separate Report and \nRecommendation on December 3, recommending that the Court grant the motion. (D.I. 45) The \nCourt will issue an order addressing that motion after the time for objections to the Report and \nRecommendation has passed. \n1 WHEREAS , on June 9, Dove-Ridgeway replied to Defendant 's Response , \nnotwithstanding that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(2) and the Court's order (see D.I. 36) \nprovide only for Objections and Response , adding that \"(n]o further briefing shall be permitted \nwith respect to objections without leave of the Court\" (D.I. 39); \nWHEREAS , on July 12, Dove-Ridge way submitted supplemental authority informing the \nCourt of the Social Security Administration 's (\"SSA\") issuance of a fully favorable decision on \nremand (D.I. 40); \nWHEREAS , on December 1, Defendant submitted supplemental authority , specifically \nciting decisions from eight federal Courts of Appeals concluding the Commissioner 's position \nunder similar circumstances was substantiall y justified (D.I. 43); \nWHEREAS , the Court has considered the parties' objections and responses de nova, see \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(l); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); Brown v. Astrue, 649 F.3d 193, 195 (3d Cir. \n2011); \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Dove-Ridgeway 's Objections (D.I. 37) are OVERRULED , Judge \nThynge's Report (D.I. 36) is ADOPTED , and Dove-Ridgewa y's motion (D.I. 31) is DENIED . \n2. Dove-Ridgewa y objects to the Report's conclusion that the Commissioner 's \nprelitigation and litigation positions were substantiall y justified. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(l)(A ) \n(prevailing party is entitled to attorneys' fees \"unless the court finds that the position of the \nUnited States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust \"). \nAs the Report explained , to satisfy her burden to show her position was substantially justified, \nthe Commissioner must demonstrate \"(1) a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged; (2) a \nreasonable basis in law for the theory ... propounded ; and (3) a reasonable connection between \n2 the facts alleged and the legal theory advanced .\" Morgan v. Perry, 142 F.3d 670, 684 (3d Cir. \n1998). \n3. As to the Commissioner 's prelitigation position, the Court agrees with the Report \nthat the Commissioner 's inaction in not properly appointing an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") \nto decide Plaintiff's disability application was substantially justified. (See D.I. 36 at 7-13) The \nCourt also agrees that the Commissioner 's inaction raises only an issue oflaw. (See id. at 9) \nAlthough there is no \"comprehensive formula\" for determining whether the government 's \nposition had a reasonable basis in law, if \"the case turns on an unsettled or close question of law, \nthe government usually will be able to establish that its legal theory was reasonable , even if it \nwas not ultimately accepted as a legal rule by the courts.\" Washington v. Heckler, 756 F.2d 959, \n961-62 (3d Cir. 1985) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). By contrast, the \ngovernment's legal position will not be substantiall y justified if it \"clearly offends established \nprecedent.\" Id. at 962. \nPlaintiff argues that, at the time the SSA Appeals Council denied her request for review \nof the ALJ' s decision, it should have been clear to the Commissioner that the ALJ who had \ndecided her case was not properly appointed. (D.I. 37 at 1) In support, Plaintiff notes (among \nother things) that by then, Lucia v. S.E.C., 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018), had been decided, and the \nSolicitor General had concluded that Lucia's reasoning applied broadly such that all ALJs should \nbe appointed as inferior officers under the Appointments Clause. (See D.I. 37 at 1-3) It is \nundisputed, however, that Plaintiff did not assert an Appointments Clause challenge at any time \nduring administrative proceedings (see D.I. 36 at 13-14), and the Court has found no settled law \nimposing a sua sponte obligation on the Commissioner to raise this issue on Plaintiff's behalf. \nSee, e.g., Rich v. Comm'r ofSoc. Sec. Admin., 477 F. Supp. 3d 388,394 (E.D. Pa. 2020) (\"We \n3 see no support imposing a sua sponte obligation on the Commissioner to raise Appointments \nClause challenges. \"); Lenz v. Saul, 2021 WL 2515167, at *3 (W.D. Pa. June 18, 2021) (same). \nAccordingly , the Court agrees with the Report that the Commissioner acted reasonably by not \nraising the issue during administrative proceedin gs. \nIn further support of this conclusion , many other courts have found the Commissioner 's \nprelitigation position substantially justified under the same or similar circumstances , even where \n-as here -the claim remained pending before the SSA after the issuance of Lucia. See, e.g., \nJones v. Comm 'r of Soc. Sec., 2021 WL 5600621, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 30, 2021) (citing cases); \nD.I. 43 (citing eight federal Courts of Appeals decisions finding Commissioner's position \nsubstantially justified under similar circumstances ). \nWhile the burden is on the Commissioner to defend her prelitigation position, she need \nonly set forth a \"reasonable basis\" for her position in doing so. See Morgan, 142 F.3d at 684; \nHanover Potato Prods., Inc. v. Shala/a, 989 F.2d 123, 128 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"[W]e will no longer \nrequire a 'solid and well-founded ' basis, but rather a reasonable basis only.\"). The \nCommissioner has met this standard. \n4. As to the Commissioner 's position in this litigation , the Court again agrees with \nthe Report. The Commissioner 's position that Plaintiff forfeited her Appointments Clause \nchallenge by failing to raise it at the administrat ive level was substantiall y justified. (See D.I. 36 \nat 13-16) Although the Third Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court have subsequently disagreed \nwith this position, finding exhaustion of Appointments Clause claims is not required in the SSA \ncontext, see Carr v. Saul, 141 S. Ct. 1352 (2021); Cirko v. Comm 'r of Soc. Sec., 948 F.3d 148 \n(3d Cir. 2020), at the time the Commissioner asserted her position there was no clearly \nestablished law governing the issue. \n4 Indeed, at the time the Commissioner raised the forfeiture defense, \"34 out of the 35 \ndistrict courts that had decided the issue had rejected attacks on the validity of an SSA ALJ's \nappointment\" if the claimant had failed to raise the challenge during administrative proceedings. \n(D.I. 34 at 6; see also Diaz v. Saul, 2020 WL 3127941, at *2 (E.D. Pa. June 12, 2020) (citing \ndistrict court cases agreeing with Commissioner 's position)) \nPlaintiff argues the Report \"ignores\" district court decisions in which EAJA claimants \nprevailed on Appointments Clause challenges. (D.I. 37 at 4) For example, in Byrd v. Saul, 469 \nF. Supp. 3d 351 (E.D. Pa. 2020), the court awarded EAJA fees after concluding the \nCommissioner's position contradicted clearly established law as set out in Sims v. Apfel, 530 \nU.S. 103 (2000). Other cases from the same district, however, disagreed with Byrd's \ncharacterization of Sims as clearly applicable in this context. See, e.g., Cortese v. Comm 'r of \nSoc. Sec., 2020 WL 3498104, at *4 n.43 (E.D. Pa. June 29, 2020) (\"The issues presented in the \nprecedential Cirko opinion earlier this year did not appear to be so easily governed by Sims.\"); \nDiaz, 2020 WL 3127941, at *3 (noting Sims does not examine \"the narrow issue of whether a \nclaimant must exhaust issues before an ALJ in the [SSA context]\"); see also Cirko, 948 F.3d at \n155 (\"[W]hile Sims does not dictate the answer, its lessons loom large.\"). The existence of a few \ncases reaching a different conclusion only highlights that reasonable minds differed as to the \neffect of relevant precedents at the time. \nThe Court concludes that this case turned on an unsettled question of law, and the \nCommissioner's position did not offend established precedent ; thus, the Commissioner's legal \ntheory had a reasonable basis in law. See Heckler, 756 F.2d at 961; see also Hoover v. Saul, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d 538, 542-43 (M.D. Pa. 2020) (describing question of substantial justification in this \ncontext as \"close, and difficult, question\" and \"keenly disputed arena\"). There was also a \n5 reasonable connection between Plaintiffs failure to raise the Appointments Clause claim at the \nadministrative level and Defendant 's forfeiture defense. Accordingly , the Commissioner 's \nposition was substantially justified.3 \n5. Dove-Ridgewa y objects to the Report's failure to address her argument that the \nCommissioner 's position was not substantiall y justified because the ALJ's decision contained \nsubstantive errors. (See D.I. 37 at 5-6) Plaintiff, however, does not mention this argument in her \nopening brief in support of her motion for EAJA fees. (See D.I. 36 at 9; see generally D.I. 32) \nAs the Report correctly notes: \nAlthough the government bears the burden of showing its position \nwas substantially justified, it[] is the plaintiff's motion for fees \nbeing decided. The [C]ourt does not find mere reference to \n\"Plaintiffs opening [summary judgment] brief' sufficient to \ntransform her opening EAJA brief [into] a full and fair recitation of \nher position, particularl y where the substantial justification of the \ngovernment 's prelitigation position was not a summary judgment \nissue. \n(D.I. 36 at 9 n.39; see also id. at 7 n.30 (noting deficiencies in Plaintiffs approach of simply \ndirecting Court to read prior briefs, \"without citation to specific pages of import\")) \n3 Plaintiff cites Morgan v. Perry, 142 F.3d at 690, for the notion that \"in the usual case, a \nconstitutional violation will preclude a finding that the government 's conduct was substantially \njustified.\" (D.I. 37 at 5) In Morgan, the Third Circuit -despite referring to this general \nprinciple, and despite the fact that the plaintiff in that case had prevailed at trial on one of his \nconstitutional claims -nonetheless affirmed the district court's finding that the government's \nposition was substantially justified. See 142 F.3d at 681-82, 688-89. In so doing, the Third \nCircuit emphasized that \"[t]he inquiry into reasonableness for EAJA purposes may not be \ncollapsed into [the] antecedent evaluation of the merits.\" Id. at 685. The Third Circuit also \nstated that \"[t]he EAJA is not a 'loser pays' statute.\" The Court views Morgan as entirely \nconsistent with its decision here, especially as the instant case turns on an unsettled question of \nlaw. \n6 6. The favorable decision on Plaintiff's disability claim (see D.I. 40) does not alter \nthe Court's conclusion (nor does Plaintiff cite any authority for the notion that it should). \nDecember 6, 2021 \nWilmington , Delaware \n7 HONORABLE LEONARD P. sni.RK. \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE "}
