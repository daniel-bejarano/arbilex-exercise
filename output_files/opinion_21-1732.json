NEWMAN ,   : \n: \nPlaintiff,    : \n: \nv.     : Civil Action No. 21-1 732-RGA  \n: \nATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE, et al.,  : \n: \nDefendant s.   : \nS\nhantell D. Newman , Wilmington, Delaware .  Pro Se Plaintiff.  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nA\npril 7, 20 22 \nWilmington, Delaware1 ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \nPlaintiff  Shantell Newman  appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4 ).  She filed this case as a \u201ctort transfer action.\u201d  (D .I. \n2-1).  The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2) (B).  \nBACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff refers to an occur rence date of December 5, 2021,\nbut the body of the Compl aint otherwise refers to events that occurred in 2014.   Plaintiff \nwent to the office of then Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden in 2014, w as held \nagainst her will  and then taken to a mental hospital.  (D.I. 2 a t 3-4).  At some point she \nwas released, and then lost her Section 8 housing \u201c over lies. \u201d  (Id. at 4).  Plaintiff seeks \ncamera footage from 2014 and refers to this matter as a landlord/tenant issue that has \nlasted seven years .  (Id.).  Plaintiff states tha t she may be homeless again because of \nthe \u201ctort transfer action\u201d that is now taking place.  ( Id.).  The Complaint goes on to allege \nthat Plaintiff\u2019s children, at leas t one of whom is an adult, \u201chave been almost murdered \nby police.\u201d  ( Id. at 5- 6).  Plaintiff seeks 3.5 million dollars in damages  and \u201cNewmans \nLaw.\u201d  (Id. at 6).       \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a /s/ Richard G. Andrews2 defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se , her \npleading is liberally construed and h er Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Id . at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly bas eless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .  \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) .\nA well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not 3 dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id. at 11 .  \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take thre e steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \nFor purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions.  Wilson v. Garcia , 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985).  In Delaware, \u00a7 \n1983 claims are subject to a two- year limitations period.  See 10 Del. C . \u00a7 8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F  .Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).  Section 1983 claims accrue \n\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is \nbased. \u201d  Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).  \nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised.  See Benak ex rel. Alliance Premie r Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P ., 435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, 807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201cAlthough 4 the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual \nrecord is required to be developed.\u2019\u201d  Davis v. Gauby , 408 F. App\u2019x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010)  (quoting Fogle v. Pierson , 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)).  Accordingly a \ncourt may dismiss a time -barred complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \nThe Complaint alleges wrongful acts occurred in 2014.  Plaintiff di d not \ncommence this action until December 8, 2021 .  Hence, it is evident from the face of the \nCompla int that all claims that accrued prior to December 8, 2019 are barred by the two \nyear limitations period.  The y will be dismissed.  \nWhile Plaintiff refers to December 5, 2021 , as a date of occurrence, the \nComplaint does not indicate what happened on that date, other than her son was in a \nvehicle that was stopped by the police.   In addition, Plaintiff checked the box that there \nis a United States Government defendant.  But no such defendant is identified, and \nnothing in the narrative hints at a United States Government defendant.   She does \nname \u201cCities Insurance Company\u201d as a defendant, but nothing in the narrative hints at \nwhy she did that.  She names the Newport Police Department, and says she is paying a \nfine to it.  She does not refer to any constitutional violations or federal statutes .  Rather \nshe asserts this is a \u201ctort transfer action .\u201d  It is unclear what this means.  What is clear is \nthat, with the dismissal of the section 1983 claim,  this Court should not exercise \nsupplemental jurisdiction over any state claims.   \nFinally, Plaintiff may not raise claims on behalf of her children to the extent that is \nher intent.  She is not an attorney.   As a non- attorney, Plaintiff  may not act as an 5 attorney for other individuals, including her children,  and may only represent her self in \nthis court.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654; see also Osei -Afriye v. The Medical College of \nPennsylvania, 937 F.2d 876 (3d Cir. 1991) (non- lawyer appearing pro se may not act as \nattorney for his children).   Therefore, the Complaint will be dismissed.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) to the extent it seeks to assert a section 1983 claim on behalf \nof Plaintiff .  Any other claims, whether state law claims asserted on behalf of Plaintiff, or \nclaims asserted on behalf of her children, will be dismissed without prejudice.  The \nCourt finds amendment futile.  \nAn ap propriate Order will be entered.  I\nN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,  : \n: \nPlaintiff,  : : \nv.     : Civil Action No. 21 -1732-RGA  \n: \nATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE , et al.,  : \n: \nDefendants.    : \nORDER \nA\nt Wilmington this  7th day of  April, 202 2, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \nIT IS ORDERED that:  \n1. The Complaint, to the extent it seeks to assert a federal claim on behalf of\nPlaintiff,  is DISMISS ED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) .\nAmendment is futile.\n2. Any other claims on behalf of Plaintiff and all claims on behalf of Plaintiff\u2019schildren are DISMISSED  without prejudice.\n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.\n___\n___________________________  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  /s/  Richard G. Andrews"}
