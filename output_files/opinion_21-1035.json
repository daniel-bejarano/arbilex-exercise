F or the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES  \nDefendants\u2019  motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Roku, Inc. (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of \nDelaware, with its principal place of business in California.  (D.I. 1).  Defendant s AlmondNet, Inc. \nand Intent IQ, LLC are a corporation and limited liability corporation, respectively, organized and \nexisting under the laws of Delaware, with their principal place of business in New York.  ( Id.).  At \n4:45 p.m. on July 15, 2021, Plaintiff  brought this declaratory judgment action against Defendants, \nasking the Court to find that Plaintiff does not infringe any valid and enforceable claim of nine United States Patent s\n1 (collectively, \u201cthe Patents -in-Suit\u201d) .  (D.I. 1).   For about 14 months  prior to \nthat date , beginning May 2020, the parties had attempted to negotiate a licensing agreement related \nto the Patents -in-Suit.  (D.I. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 4 \u20135).  On July 15, 2021, i.e., the day this  action was filed, Gil \nFuch sberg, a Roku executive, told Roy Shkedi, the CEO of AlmondNet  and Chairman of Intent \nIQ, that Roku did not intend to renew the  Non-Disclosure Agreement which had enabled the parties \nto freely negotiate.  ( Id. \u00b6 6).  Shkedi then told Fuchsberg that he \u201cwould have no choice but to \nprotect [Defendant s\u2019] property rights and pursue a lawsuit against Roku in Texas, and informed \nhim that he will notice the filed lawsuit that very same day.\u201d  ( Id.).   \nThe parties filed lawsuits against each other.  At 4:45 p.m. on July 15, 2021, Roku filed the \npresent action against AlmondNet and Intent IQ in this District.  (D.I. 19, Ex. B).  Roughly six \n \n1  The Patents -in-Suit are United States Patent N os. 8,677,398, 10,715,878, 7,822,639, \n8,244,586, 10,026,100, 10,628,857, 8,566,164, 8,595,069, and 10,321,198. 2 hours later, AlmondNet and Intent IQ filed an action in the Western District of Texas against Roku, \nalleging infringement of the Patents -in-Suit.  ( Id., Ex. B, E x. C).  Roughly one month later, \nAlmondNet filed another suit against Roku  in the Western District of Texas , alleging infringement \nof three patents not at issue in the present dispute.  (W.D. Tex. No. 21- 876-ADA).  Two weeks \nlater, Defendants initiated fou r additional actions in the Western District of Texas, all of which \nalleged infringement of the Patents -in-Suit.  The defendants in those cases are Samsung (W.D. \nTex. No. 21- 891-ADA), Facebook (W.D. Tex. No. 21- 896-ADA), Microsoft (W.D. Tex. No. 21-\n897-ADA), and Amazon (W.D. Tex. No. 21- 898-ADA).  \nAlmondNet and Intent IQ now move to dismiss the present action or transfer it to the \nWestern District of Texas.  (D.I. 13).  Defendants assert that Plaintiff\u2019s first- in-time suit should \nnot be given priority over its later -filed action, and that the balance of public and private factors \nweigh in favor of transferring the present action to the Western District of Texas.  (D.I. 14).  Plaintiff opposes Defendants\u2019 motion, contending that the first -to-file rule should lead this Court \nto refuse to transfer the case, that this case could not have originally been brought in the Western District of Texas, and even if it could have, the balance of private and public interests do not weigh \nin favor of a transfer.  (D.I. 19).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cA plaintiff, as the injured party, generally ha[s] been \u2018accorded [the] privilege of bringing \nan action where he chooses.\u2019\u201d  Helicos Biosciences Corp. v. Illumina, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 367, 371 (D. Del. 2012) (quoting Norwood v. Kirkpatr ick, 349 U.S. 29, 31 (1955)).  Plaintiff\u2019s choice \nof location in bringing the action \u201cshould not be lightly disturbed.\u201d  Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., \n55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995).   \nDistrict courts have the authority to transfer venue \u201c[f]or the conve nience of parties and \nwitnesses, in the interest of justice, . . . to any other district or division where it might have been 3 brought.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).  The Third Circuit has made clear that, to  find that an action \u201cmight \nhave been brought\u201d in a dist rict, \u201cvenue must have been proper in the transferee district and the \ntransferee court must have had power to command jurisdiction over all of the defendants.\u201d  Shutte \nv. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 24 (3d Cir. 1970).   \nIf a court finds that an action \u201cmight have been brought\u201d in the proposed transferee district, \nthe court must then consider whether transfer is appropriate.  To these ends, the  Third Circuit has \nrecognized that:  \ncourts have not limited their consideration to the three enumerated \nfactors in \u00a7 1404(a) (convenience of parties, convenience of witnesses, or interests of justice), and, indeed, commentators have called on the courts to \u201cconsider all relevant factors to determine whether on balance the litigation w ould more conveniently proceed \nand the interests of justice be better served by transfer to a different forum.\u201d  \n \nJumara, 55 F .3d at 879 (citation omitted).  The Jumara  court went on to describe twelve \u201cprivate \nand public interests protected by the language  of \u00a7 1404(a).\u201d  Id.  The private interests include:  \nplaintiff\u2019s forum preference as manifested in the original choice; the defendant\u2019s preference; whether the claim arose elsewhere; the convenience of the parties as indicated by their relative physical and financial condition; the convenience of the witnesses \u2013 but only to \nthe extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and the location of books and records (similarly limited to the extent that the files c ould not be produced in the \nalternative forum).  \n \nId. (citations omitted).  The public interests include:  \nthe enforceability of the judgment; practical considerations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; the relative administrative difficulty in the two fora resulting from court \ncongestion; the local interest in deciding local controversies at home; the public policies of the fora; and the familiarity of the trial judge with the applicable state law in diversity cases.  \n 4 Id. at 879- 80.  The party seeking transfer bears the burden \u201cto establish that a balancing of proper \ninterests weigh[s] in favor of transfer.\u201d  Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. \n1970).  Courts have \u201cbroad discretion to determine, on an individualize d, case- by-case basis, \nwhether convenience and fairness considerations weigh in favor of transfer.\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 883.  However, \u201cunless the balance of convenience of the parties is strongly in favor of [the] \ndefendant, the plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum should prevail.\u201d  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25.   \nWhen  there are parallel actions in different districts, courts must also  consider the first -to-\nfile rule in  deciding a motion to transfer.  In patent actions, Federal Circuit law controls application \nof the first -to-file rule.  Elecs. for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle , 394 F.3d 1341, 1345\u201346 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  \nFederal Circuit law counsels that the forum of \u201c[t]he firs t-filed action is preferred, even if it is \ndeclaratory, unless considerations of judicial and litigant economy, and the just and effective disposition of disputes, require otherwise.\u201d  Serco Services Co., L.P. v. Kelley Co., Inc., 51 F.3d 1037 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Among the reasons to \ndecline to apply the first -to-file rule are \u201cthe convenience and availability of witnesses, or absence \nof jurisdiction over all necessary or desirable parties, or the possibility of consolidation with related litigation, or considerations relating to the real party in interest. \u201d  Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & \nCo., 998 F.2d 931, 938 (Fed. Cir. 1993), abrogated on other grounds by  Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., \n515 U.S. 277, 288 (1995) .  There must \u201cbe sound reason that would make it unjust or inefficient \nto continue the first -filed action\u201d and transfer the case.  Id. at  938.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. 1404(a) First Step: Appropriate Venue  \nSection 1404(a) permits a district court to  \u201ctransfer any civil action to any other district or \ndivision where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented .\u201d  Plaintiff does not consent to transfer to the Western District of Texas.  Therefore, the 5 Court must address the threshold inquiry under \u00a7 1404(a) \u2013 whether this action \u201cmight have been \nbrought\u201d in the Western District of Texas.  \nTo find that an action \u201cmight have been brought\u201d in a district, \u201c venue must have been \nproper in the transferee district and the transferee court must have had power to command \njurisdiction over all of the defendants .\u201d  Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 24 (3d Cir. \n1970)  (emphasis added).  Defendants argue that each of these requirements is satisfied.  First, \nDefendants argue that because \u201ca substantial part of the events . . . giving rise to the claim \noccurred\u201d in the Western District of Texas, and because Plaintiff maintains an office there, venue is appropriate  in the District.   (D.I. 22 at 4\u20135) .  Defendants also argue that the personal jurisdiction \nrequirement is satisfied because they filed six enforcement actions in that District and consent to jurisdiction in that District.  ( Id. at 5).    \nHere, the Court fin ds that  transfer would be inappropriate because the Western District  \nlacked  personal jurisdiction over Defendants when  Plaintiff filed the present action.  Defendants\u2019 \nprimary argument for the existence of personal jurisdiction is that its later -filed enfo rcement \nactions in the Western District permit the District to exercise jurisdiction over them .  But this \nargument ignores the text of \u00a7 1404(a) and the  Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of that statute in Hoffman \nv. Blaski , 363 U.S. 335 (1960).  In Hoffman , the Court held that \u00a7  1404(a)\u2019s dictate that transfer \nbe limited to districts \u201cwhere it might have been brought\u201d allows a court to transfer cases only to those venues that would have been appropriate at the time the plai ntiff brought its initial action.  \nThe Supreme Court explained that \u00a7 1404(a)\u2019s \u201cphrase \u2018where it might have been brought\u2019 \ncan[not] be interpreted to mean . . . \u2018where it may now be rebrought  . . . . \u201d  Id. at 342\u201343.  The \nCourt went on to explain that \u201cwe do not see how the conduct of a defendant after suit has been \ninstituted can add to the forums where it might have been brought.  In the normal meaning of 6 words this language of Section 1404(a) directs the attention of  the judge who is considering a \ntransf er to the situation which existed when suit was instituted.\u201d  Id. at 343\u201344.  See also Tlapanco \nv. Elges , No. 15- CV-2852 (AJN), 2017 WL 4329789, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2017)  (explaining \nthat Hoffman held that \u201c absent the consent of all parties, the tran sferee district must be one where \nthe plaintiff would have had \u2018 a right to bring [the] action[ ] \u2019 at the time the action was \ncommenced. \u201d).   \nAll of Defendants\u2019 actions in the Western District of Texas arose after the present action \nwas filed.  E ven assumin g the correctness of Defendants\u2019 assertion that its enforcement actions in \nthe Western District of Texas permit that District to exercise personal jurisdiction over them, that \njurisdiction would have arisen only after Roku filed this action.  Therefore, these later -filed actions \ncannot support an argument that the Western District of Texas could have exercised jurisdiction over AlmondNet and Intent IQ when Roku filed this declaratory action.  For the very same reason, Defendants\u2019 argument that they now cons ent to jurisdiction in the Western District of Texas does \nnot confer jurisdiction at the time Roku filed the present action. \nBecause the Court finds that personal jurisdiction would have been lacking in the Western \nDistrict of Texas when Plaintiff filed th is instant action, Defendants\u2019  transfer motion must be \nDENIED.   \nB. First -to-File \nAs transfer has been deemed inappropriate, the Court will now consider whether to dismiss \nthis action in light of the later -filed infringement suit.  \nWhere there are parallel proceedings in two federal courts, the  first-to-file rule generally \nexpresses a preference for the court with the first -filed action to hear the  case.  \u201c Although district \ncourts can . . . dispense with the first -to-file rule, there must \u2018 be sound reason that would make it \nunjust or inefficient to continue the first -filed action. \u2019\u201d  Communications  Test Design, Inc. v. 7 Contec, LLC , 952 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2020)  (quoting Genentech, Inc . v. Eli Lilly and Co., \n998 F.2d 931, 938 (Fed. Cir. 1993)).  The burden is on the party seeking to establish a compelling \ncircumstances exception to the first -to-file rule.  In re Nitro Fluids L.L.C., 978 F.3d 1308, 1311 \n(Fed. Cir. 2020).  In this case, t he Court finds that Defendants have not met their burden of \ndemonstrating sound reasons that would justify departing from  the first -filed rule . \nDefendants contend that Plaintiff\u2019s suit was anticipatory, and therefore should not be \ntreated as the first -filed suit.  A court may consider whether a party filed suit to preempt another\u2019s \ninfringement suit when ruling on the dismissal or transfer of a declaratory action.  Elecs. for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle , 394 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  A suit is \u201canticipa tory for the \npurposes of being an exception to the first -to-file rule if the plaintiff in the first- filed action filed \nsuit on receipt of specific, concrete indications that a suit by the defendant was imminent.\u201d  Woodbolt Distribution, LLC v. Natural Alte rnatives Intern., Inc . No. 11- 1266- GMS, 2013 WL \n247041, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 23, 2013)  (citation omitted).  Here, when the parties decided to \nterminate licensing negotiations, Roy Shkedi, the CEO of Defendant AlmondNet and Chairman of Defendant Intent IQ, t old Gil Fuchsberg, an executive with Plaintiff Roku, that AlmondNet and \nIntent IQ would be filing an infringement action against Roku in Texas \u201cthat very same day.\u201d  (D.I.  16 \u00b6 6).   \nTherefore, it appears that Roku may have  \u201cfiled suit on receipt of specific, concrete \nindications that a suit by the defendant was imminent.\u201d   But it does not necessarily follow that \nRoku filed suit because it believed Defendants\u2019 infringement suit to be imminent.  Instead, it is just as likely that  Roku, after more than  a year of unfruitful negotiation with entities who believe \nit to be infringing their patents , resorted to the courts to declare its \u201crights\u201d and \u201clegal relations\u201d \u2013  \nexactly what 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 is designed to do.  The Court cannot conclude that Roku filed the 8 action in bad faith or to avoid what it perceived as an  unfavorable forum.  Cf. Commc\u2019ns Test \nDesign, Inc. v. Contec LLC , 367 F. Supp. 3d 350 (E.D. Pa. 2019)  (declining to apply the first-to-\nfile rule in a case where the plaintiff filed suit after in ducing the defendant to believe negotiations \nwere still possible and ongoing) , aff\u2019d , 952 F.3d 1356 (Fed Cir. 2020) ; E.E.O.C. v. Univ. of \nPennsylvania, 850 F.2d 969 (3d Cir. 1988)  (instructing that courts may refuse to apply the first -\nfiled rule \u201cwhen the f irst-filing party instituted suit in one form in anticipation of the opposing \nparty\u2019s imminent suit in another, less favorable forum.\u201d) .  Based on the unique circumstances of \nthis case, the timing of this suit does not supply reasons to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the \npresent action.   \nDefendants have also failed to meet their burden of arguing that  other factors should lead \nthe Court to decline jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s declaratory action.  Defendants assert that the \n\u201cconvenience and availability of witnesses\u201d favors dismissal but  have  not shown that any relevant \nwitnesses would find litigating in Texas more convenient than litigating in Delaware.  Although \nDefendants point to Roku\u2019s physical presence in the Western District of Texas (D.I. 15), Plaintiff asserts that its employees in Austin, Texas do not possess knowledge relevant to the present dispute .  (See D.I. 19, Ex. A \u00b6 6).  Rather, Plaintiff states that the majority of  its employees with \nrelevant knowledge are based out of its Boston, Massachusetts office.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6\u20138).  The Court \nfinds Plaintiff\u2019s assertions more credible  on this front.  Further, the Court notes that Defendants \nare organized and exist under the laws of Delaware, and so are presumably not inconvenienced by \nlitigating in Delaware.  See Micron Technology, Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 645 F.3d 1311, 1332 (Fed. \nCir. 2011) (\u201cGiven that  both parties were incorporated in Delaware, they had both willingly \nsubmitted to suit there, which weighs in favor of keeping the litigation in Delaware.\u201d).  9 Defendants also argue that judicial economy favors Texas over Delaware, but the Court \ndoes not find that judicial economy  can justify dismissal  in this case.  To begin with, the Federal \nCircuit has cautioned against allowing co- pending litigation to dominate an analysis of judicial \neconomy.  See  In re Google Inc., No. 2017 -107, 2017 WL 977038, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 23, 2017) .  \nOn the record before it , the Court  is concerned tha t finding the \u201cjudicial economy\u201d factor  \ndispositive would permit parties to fashion an exception to the first -to-file rule.  After being sued \nin the  District of Delaware, Defend ants chose to file four separate infringement actions against \ncorporations  in the Western District of Texas \u2013 four of whom Defendants allege to be corporations \norganized and existing under the laws of Delaware ( W.D. Tex. No. 21- 896-ADA, D.I. 1 \u00b6 3; W.D. \nTex. No. 21- 898, D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 3 \u20135).  The Court is not persuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that judicial \neconomy justifies a departure from the  first-to-file rule here, as  it was Defendants\u2019 own litigation \nstrategy that brought litigation to the Western District o f Texas.  Therefore, the Court does not find \nthis consideration to be a sound reason to dismiss hearing the present action. \nFor the above reasons, the Court does not find it appropriate to decline to exercise \njurisdiction over the present action.  Accordingly, Defendant s\u2019 motion to dismiss is DENIED.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant s\u2019 motion to dismiss or transfer t he case is DENIED .  \nAn appropriate order will follow.  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nROKU, INC.,  \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n  v. \n ALMONDNET, INC. and  \nINTENT IQ, LLC,  \n \n   Defendants.  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n)  \n   C.A.
