(D.I. \n50)  With the Motion, Netgear seeks an order  declaring claim 1 of United States Patent No. \n6,289,434 (the \u201c '434 patent\u201d)  invalid for failure to claim patent eligible subject matter.  For the \nreasons that follow, the Court recommends that Netgear\u2019s  Motion be DENIED . \nI. BACKGROUND \nA.   Factual Background  \nThe '434 patent is entitled \u201c Apparatus and Method of Implementing Systems on Silicon  \nUsing Dynamic -Adaptive Run- Time Reconfigurable Circuits for Processing Multiple, \nIndependent Data and Control Streams of Varying Rates .\u201d  (D.I. 1, ex. A (hereinafter, \u201c '434 \npatent \u201d))  It was issued on September 11, 2001 from U.S. Appl. No. 09/032,530, which was filed \non February 27, 1998.  ( Id.)  The invention relates to the field of \u201c runtime reconfigurable \ndynamic -adaptive digital circuits [ that] can implement a myriad of digital processing functions \nrelated to systems control, digital signal processing, communications, image processing, speech and voice recognition or synthesis, three -dimensional graphics rendering[ and] video 2 \n processing.\u201d  ( Id., col. 1:31- 38)  The object of the invention is to provide a new apparatus for \nimplementing systems on chips that enable a user to achieve the \u201c performance of fixed -function \nimplementation s at a lower cost. \u201d  (Id., cols. 2:64- 3:1)    \n The \u201cBackground of the Invention\u201d section describes four prior art ways of implementing \nvarious functions on an integrated circuit.  The most common method entails specifically \ndesigning the functions to be performed by \u201c placing on silicon an interconnected gr oup of digital \ncircuits in a non- modifiable manner (hard- wired or fixed [-]function implementation). \u201d  (Id., col. \n1:42-47)  The circuits are designed to provide the fastest possible operation of the circuit in the \nleast amount of silicon area.  ( Id., col. 1:47- 49)  These circuits are comprised of an \ninterconnection of various amounts of random  access memory and logic circuits.  ( Id., col. 1:49-\n51)  Complex systems on silicon are broken up into separate blocks, with each block designed separately to perform solely the function that it was intended to perform.  ( Id., col. 1: 51-54)  \nEach block has to be individually tested and validated, and then the entire system must be tested.  \n(Id., col. 1: 54-56)  Th e patent explains that th is method was  the \u201c smallest (i.e., cheapest in terms \nof silicon area) \u201d among the four prior art  methods of implementing such systems , but that it was \nalso \u201cbecoming increasingly complex[.]\u201d   (Id., col. 1: 57-65)  This method is also the best \nperforming method of the prior art methods.  ( Id., col. 2:34- 38)   \n The second prior art method entails utilizing software with a microprocessor and an \nassociated computing system.   (Id., col. 2:1- 2)  However, the patent explains that th is system \ncannot deliver real -time performance in a cost -effective manner .  (Id., col. 2:3- 5)  The use of this \nsystem is best for model ing the subsequent hard -wired/fixed -function system before significant \ndesign effort is put into the system design.  ( Id., col. 2:5- 8)   3 \n  The third prior art method of implementing various functions on an int egrated circuit is \nby using a digital signal processor  (\u201cDSP\u201d) , whi ch is a class of computing machines that are \nuseful for real -time processing of various speech, audio, video and image processing problems.  \n(Id., col. 2:9- 12)  However, the patent notes that the use of DSPs are not cost -effective for \nperforming tasks that do not have a high degree of parallelism in them , nor for performing tasks \nrequiring multiple parallel threads of operations ( such as three -dimensional graphics ).  (Id., col. \n2:14-17)   \n The fourth way of imple menting such systems is by using field programmable gate arrays \n(\u201cFPGAs\u201d).  ( Id., col. 2:18- 19)  FPGAs are devices consisting of a two -dimensional array of fine \ngrained logic and storage elements that can be connected together in the field by downloading a  \nconfiguration stream that routes signals between these elements.  ( Id., col. 2:19- 23)  While the \npatent notes that utilizing FPGAs provides a greater flexibility for optimizing the silicon usage in \nsuch devices , that flexibility comes with an increased cost and a decrease in performance.  ( Id., \ncol. 2: 26-33) \n The second, third and fourth systems could theoretically be cheaper to implement by \nremoving redundancy from the system, which can be accomplished by reusing computational blocks and memor y.  (Id., col. 2: 39-41)  However, these systems are increasingly complex, and \nthus their computational density is very high when compared with fixed- function \nimplementations  (i.e., the first prior art method described).  ( Id., col. 2:42- 44)  As for fixed - \nfunction systems, they must include blocks designed to implement all possible functional requirements of the required data processing \u2014regardless of the final application of the device or \nthe nature of the data.  ( Id., col. 2: 53-57)  Accordingly, if a  fixed -function implementation  is 4 \n required to adaptively process data, it has to commit silicon resources to process all possible \ntypes of data .  (Id., col. 2:58- 60)   \n The inventor of the '434 patent set out to provide a new apparatus for implementing \nsystems on  silicon that will enable the user to achieve the performance of fixed -function \nimplementation at a lower cost.  ( Id., cols. 2:64- 3:1)  The specification explains that cost is \nreduced by removing redundancy from the system, which is turn achieved by re- using groups of \ncomputational and storage elements in different configurations.  ( Id., col. 3:2- 4)  The cost is \nfurther reduced by utilizing only static or dynamic random access memory  as a means for \nmaintaining the state of the system.  ( Id., col. 3:4- 6)  The invention purportedly provides a way \nto effectively adapt the configuration of the circuit to different input data and processing requirements.  ( Id., col. 3: 6-8)  This reconfigur ation can take place dynamically in run -time \nwithout any decrease in performance over fixed -function implementations.  ( Id., col. 3:8- 11)   \n The \u201cSummary of the Invention\u201d section of the specification explains that an apparatus is \nprovided \u201cfor adaptively dynamically reconfiguring groups of computational and storage elements in run -time to process multiple separate streams of data and control at va rying rates.  \nThe aggregate of the dynamically reconfigurable computational and storage elements will heretofore be referred to as a \u2018media processing unit.\u2019\u201d  ( Id., col. 3:13- 19)  The patent states that \nthese media processing units constitute the \u201cheart\u201d of the claimed architecture.  ( Id., col. 13:4- 5)  \nAnd t he specification further explains that the media processing units include \u201ce xecution units\u201d \nconsisting of a multiplier, an arithmetic unit, an arithmetic logic unit and a bit manipulation unit.  (Id., cols. 16:15- 23:35)   \nThe '434 patent recites a single claim: \n1.  An apparatus for processing data, comprising:  \n 5 \n an addressable memory for s toring the data, and a plurality of \ninstructions, and having a plurality of input/outputs, each s aid \ninput/output for providing and receiving at least one s elected from \nthe data and the instructions ;  \n \na plurality of media processing units, each media proc essing unit \nhaving an input/output coupled to at least one of the addressable \nmemory input/outputs and comprising:   a multiplier having a data input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, an instruction input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, and a data output coupled to the media processing unit input/output;  \n an arithmetic unit having a data input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, an instruction input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, and a data output coupled to the media processing unit input/output;  \n an arithmetic logic unit having a data input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, an instruction input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, and a data output coupl ed to \nthe media processing unit input/output, capable of operating concurrently with at least one s elected from the multiplier and \narithmetic unit; and  \n a bit manipulation unit having a data input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, an instruction input coupled to the media processing unit input/output, and a data output coupled to the media processing unit input/output, capable of operating concurrently with the arithmetic logic unit and at least one s elected \nfrom the multiplier and arithmetic unit;  \n each of the plurality of media processors for performing at least one operation, s imultaneously with the performance of other \noperations by other media processing units, each operation comprising:   receiving at the media processor input/output an instruction from the memory;   receiving at the media processor input/output data from the memory;   processing the data responsive to the instruction received to produce at least one result ; and  6 \n  \nproviding at least one of the at least one result at the media processor input/output.  \n(Id., cols. 55:21- 56:33)  \n Additional relevant facts about the '434 patent  will be set out below in Section III.  \nB. Procedural Background  \nAltair filed this case on July 28, 2020, alleging that Netgear\u2019s Meural 27\u201d digital photo\n \nframe infringes claim 1 of the '434 patent .  (D.I. 1  at \u00b6 26 )1  Netgear  filed the instant Motion on  \nAugust 13, 2021, (D.I. 50), which w as fully briefed as of September 24, 2021, (D.I. 58).  A \nMarkman hearing is scheduled for February 23, 2022.  (D.I. 30 at \u00b6 14)  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n  In evaluating a  motion  for judgment  on the  pleadings  brought  pursuant  to Federal  Rule  of \nCivil Procedure  12(c)  (\u201cRule  12(c)\u201d), the Court must view all factual allegations in a complaint \nin the light most favorable to the non- moving party.  See Wolfington v.  Reconstructive  \nOrthopaedic  Assocs.  II PC , 935 F.3d 187, 195 (3d. Cir. 2019).  This is the same standard that \napplies to a motion to dismiss  brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Id .  \nA Rule  12(c) motion will not be granted \u201cunless the movant clearly establishes that no material \nissue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\u201d  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In deciding such a motion, the Court \nmay consider only the pleadings, the exhi bits attached thereto, matters of public record and \nundisputedly authentic documents integral to the pleadings.  I d.   \n \n1  This case has been referred to the Court  by United States District Judge Maryellen \nNoreika  to hear and resolve all pretrial matters, up to and including expert discovery matters .  \n(D.I. 10)  7 \n   The instant Rule 12( c) Mot ion assert s that claim 1 of the '434 patent  is directed to patent -\nineligible subject matter \u2014i.e., it avers  that dismissal is warranted due to the presence of an \naffirmative defense.  The Court has often set out the relevant legal standards for review of this \ntype of Section 101- related motion at the p leading stage, including in Genedics, LLC v. Meta \nCo., Civil Action No. 17- 1062- CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2- 5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).  The \nCourt hereby incorporates by reference its discussion in Genedics  of these legal standards and \nwill follow th e standards herein.  To the extent consideration of Netgear\u2019s Motion necessitates \ndiscussion of other, related legal principles, the Court will set out those principles in Section III below.  \n \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \n  In Alice \u2019s first step, the  Court must determine whether claim 1 is \u201cdirected to\u201d a patent -\nineligible concept  (here, an abstract idea) .  Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. 208, \n217 (2014).  The  \u201c\u2018directed to\u2019 inquiry applies a stage -one filter to claims, considered in light of \nthe specification, based on whether \u2018 their character as a whole \u2019\u201d or their \u201cfocus\u201d is directed to \nexcluded subject matter.  Enfish , LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1335- 36 (Fed. Cir. \n2016) (quoting Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc., 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (emphasis added)).  \n \n  Here, Netgear argues  that claim 1 is  directed to the abstract idea  of \u201cdata processing [,]\u201d \nand that this is so  because the claim fails to \u201crecite how the claimed result [of processing data] is \nachieved in a particularized way or how it arises out of otherwise generic computer components.\u201d   (D.I. 51 at 1, 8; see also id. at 2 , 7, 12; D.I. 58 at 1)  For its part, Altair does not \ndispute that \u201c data processing \u201d is an abstract idea.  (D.I. 57 at 10)   And the  Court agrees that it is .  \nSee, e.g. , iLife  Techs., Inc. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc., 839 F. App\u2019x 534, 536 (Fed. Cir. 2021)  (\u201cWe 8 \n have routinely held that claims directed to gathering and processing data are directed to an \nabstract idea.\u201d) ; Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n , 776 \nF.3d 1343, 1347 ( Fed. Cir. 2014) (concluding that claims were directed to the \u201cabstract idea of 1) \ncollecting data, 2) recognizing certain data within the collected data set, and 3) storing that recognized data in a memory\u201d).  \n \n But is it right to say that claim 1 is directed to  just \u201cdata processing\u201d?  Altair says no.  \nInstead, Altair argues  that the claim is directed to something much more specific:  to an \napparatus :  (1) that includes  a plurality of media processing units  (comprised of execution units \nthat include a multiplier, an arithmetic unit, an arithmetic logic unit and a bit manipulation unit);  (2) that a llows certain of the execution units to operate concurrently with each other; and (3) that \nrequires the medi a processing units be  connected to addressable memory input/output s, such that \neach of the media processing units can simultaneously receive instructions and data from the memory, process the data and output a result with the other media processing units.  ( D.I. 57 at \n10, 13, see also id. at 19)   For the reasons discussed below, t he Court agrees with Altair .       \n The Court turns first to the specification , which is a useful tool for determining what the \npatent \u2019s claim is  directed to .  See Genedics, LLC , 2018 WL 3991474, at *4 .  Here, there are \nportions of the specification that support Altair\u2019s position.  For example, the specification notes that the invention\u2019s use of multiple media processing unit s is the \u201cheart\u201d of the claimed \narchitecture.  ( '434 patent, col. 13:4- 5)  It then e xplains that each of these media processing units \nare \u201cmade up of very high speed core elements that on a pipelined basis can be configured to form a more complex function[, which] leads to a lower gate count, thereby giving a smaller die size and ultimately a lower cost. \u201d  (Id., col. 13:26- 31)  These aspects of the media processing \nunit are in turn said to help contribute to their \u201cr e-configurability and re -usability [,]\u201d ( id., col. 9 \n 13:26- 27), which in turn is said to help remove redundancy and reduce cost , (id., cols. 2:64-\n3:11).2  The specification also call s out the importance of the fact that various of the execution \nunits can \u201cwork concurrently during an execution phase.\u201d  ( Id., col. 24:38- 62)  And it discuss es \nthe importance of the media proces sing units being able to work simultaneously, such as when it \ndescr ibes how the apparatus can process data \u201cin series or in parallel [.]\u201d  ( Id., Abstract ; see also \nid., cols. 13:5- 9, 54:54- 62); Nw. Univ. v. KUKA AG , Case No. 21 C 599, 2021 WL 4711538, at \n*4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 8, 2021) (explaining that certain provisions in the specification \u201csuggest that \nwhat the claims are directed to is the intelligent assist system\u2019s modular architecture \u201d and not \nsimply the proposed abstract idea, which was  \u201cnetwork communication for device interaction\u201d ).  \n These aspects of the invention are also prominently referenced in claim 1.  The claim \nrequires that the apparatus referred to therein must be  comprised of particular components \u2014\nincluding the multiple media processing  units , which in turn must be  comprised of a multiplier, \nan arithmetic unit, an arithmetic logic unit and a bit manipulation unit .  ('434 patent, cols. 55: 27-\n56:20)  It further dictates that certain of the se execution units must be  capable of operating \nconcurrently, ( id., col . 56:6- 20), and that the plurality of multiple media processing units \nthemselves  must be able to perform operations simultaneously with each other , (id., col. 56: 21-\n33).  (D.I. 57 at 12) ; see also Visual  Memory LLC  v. NVIDIA  Corp., 867 F.3d 1253, 1260 (Fed. \nCir. 2017)  (rejecting the defendant\u2019s assertion that the claims were directed to no more than a \ndesired result in the context of generic computer components , where even the broadest  claim \n\u201crequires a memory system with a main memory and a cache memory, where the memory \n \n2  The specification sets out additional benefits with respect to the media processing \nunits, including that they make writing software very easy because th ey are virtually identical to \none another, and that any one of the media processing units can take on a supervisory role and \nact as a central controller.  ( '434 patent, col. 13:32 -40) 10 \n system is configured by a computer to store a type of data in the cache memory based on the type \nof processor connected to the memory system \u201d).   \n Netgear\u2019s arguments to the contrary\u2014i.e., that claim 1 is not directed to these more \nparticularized aspects of the claim, but instead simply to  the general concept of \u201cdata \nprocessing\u201d \u2014are not persuasive.  \nFor example, i n arguing that claim 1 is directed only to \u201cda ta processing,\u201d Netgear  simply \nignores the computer components  that are found in the claim ; having done so, Netgear focuses \non the remaining portions of the claim language, in order to justify the appropriateness of its \nproposed abstract idea.  (D.I. 51 at 10- 11; see also id. at 6 )  In other words, Netgear highlights \nthe parts of the claim requiring that:  (1) the addressable memory stores data and certain instructions; and ( 2) media processing unit s receive an instruction and data, process  that data, \nand provide  at least one result.  ( Id.)  By emphasizing these claimed steps of storing, or \nreceiving , or processing  or providing data, Netgear tries to portray the claim as  being focused  \nsolely  on \u201cfunctional language\u201d and \u201cresult -focused elements [.]\u201d  (Id. at 10-13)   \n The problem with that approach, however, is that it  leaves out the meat of the claim \u2014i.e., \nthe portions  of claim 1 requiring that the apparatus must include multiple media processing units  \n(as well as each of the four types of execution units making up such units ), and requiring th at \nthose units  must  work together and with the addressable memory in a certain way.  Netgear says \nthat it did so because the claimed computer components  and the way they interact with each \nother  are merely \u201cgeneric\u201d and \u201cemployed in the conventional manner.\u201d  ( Id. at 6 -8; see also D.I. \n58 at 1- 3); see also In re TLI Commc\u2019ns LLC Patent Litig., 823 F.3d 607, 612 (Fed. Cir. 2016) \n(asking, at step one, whether claims were directed to an improvement in the functioning of a computer or, instead, to, inter alia , generalized steps to be performed on a computer using 11 \n conventional computer activity); Enfish , 822 F.3d at  1335- 36 (asking, at step one, \u201cwhether t he \nfocus of the claims is on [a]  specific asserted improvement in computer capabilities  . . . or, \ninstead, on a process that qualifies as an \u2018abstract idea\u2019 for which computers are invoked merely \nas a tool\u201d).   But there N etgear runs into a problem:  there is nothing in the record that clearly \nsupports this  assertion.  In making its \u201cgeneric\u201d/\u201cconventional\u201d argument, Netgear cite s to a \nportion of column 13 of the specification and state s that:  (1) \u201cmedia processing units\u201d are \n\u201cconventional microprocessors capable of \u2018executing one complex 32 bit instruction per clock \ncycle\u2019\u201d ; and (2) the '434 patent \u201cacknowledges that [a media processing unit is not]  \u2018key\u2019 to the \nalleged invention.\u201d   (D.I. 51  at 7 (citing '434 patent, col. 13:4- 7))  But the  cited portion of \ncolumn 13 does not say this  at all.  There, the specification is not  acknowledging that the \nreferenced media processing units are \u201cconventional\u201d\u2014indeed, th e word \u201cconventional\u201d is never \nused.  To the contrary, th e media processing units are described therein as the \u201cheart\u201d of the \nclaimed architecture.  ( '434 patent, col. 13:4- 5)  And otherwise, this portion of the spe cification \nsimply notes the speed at which these units are capable of operating (i.e., one complex 32 bit instruction per clock cycle) , nothing more .\n3  While it is not disputed that the media processing \nunits employ \u201cconventional execution units \u201d (i.e., the multiplier, the arith metic unit, the \narithmetic logic unit and the bit manipulation unit) , (D.I. 57 at 12), there is nothing in the record \nto demonstrate that the claimed arrangement  of these units \u2014e.g., to form media processing units \n \n3  (See D.I. 57 at 11 (Plaintiff noting that \u201cDefendant simply states that a media \nprocessing unit can execute \u2018one complex 32 bit instruction per clock cycle,\u2019 which only refers to \nthe speed of operations, not the circuit architecture\u201d))   \n 12 \n that can be run concurrently \u2014was w ell-known and conventional in the prior art.  ( Id. at 12 ; see \nalso id. at 19 )4   \n At other point s in its briefing, Netgear argues  that claim  1 \u201ccontains no specific \nconfiguration of computer components what soever [.]\u201d  (D.I. 51 at 11; D.I. 58 at 6)   But th is \nassertion s eems to be  contradicted by a nother  statement Netgear made in its opening brief, where \nit acknowledged that the \u201cfocus\u201d of the claim was on \u201cthe concept of processing data by \nconfiguring circuits  using a method different from prior art methods [.]\u201d  (D.I. 51 at 12 (emphasis \nadded) )  Netgear\u2019s prior acknowledgement suggests that claim 1 does  require at least some sort \nof configuration of circuit architecture different tha n what was used  in the prior art.  And indeed, \nclaim 1 does have certain requirements regarding the components that make up t his data \nprocessing apparatus.  The claim requires that the execution units that are part of the media \nprocessing unit each have data inputs, instruction inputs, and data outputs all coupled to the media processing unit input/output  and that certain execution units are  capable of operating \nconcurrently with certain other execution units .  (See '434 patent, col. 56:10- 12, 17- 20; see also \nid., col. 24:38- 40)  It also requires that the inputs and outputs of the media processing units be \ncoupled to at least one of the addressable memory input/outputs, such that the media processing \n \n4  One related challenge in the Section 101 analysis here is that the patent des cribes \nthe \u201ckey element behind the architecture of the [claimed apparatus as] one of re- configurability \nand re -usability.\u201d  ( '434 patent, col. 13:26- 27)  Netgear asserts in its briefing that it is not the \nclaimed media processing units or the way they are co nnected to other components described in \nthe claim  that \u201cconfers the purported \u2018re -configurability and re -usability \u2019\u201d; instead, Netgear \nargues that \u201cunclaimed and undisclosed software running on otherwise generic computer \ncomponents\u201d  is what  does so.  (D.I. 51 at 7)  The difficulty for Netg ear is that it does not cite to \nanything in support of this proposition.  And the record does not make it clear enough that some unclaimed software component ( as opposed to what  is described in the claim) is what is the key \nto delivering the desired re -configurability and re -usability.  Indeed, as noted above, the patent at \ntimes appears to suggest that the claimed components are in fact key to this outcome.  ( See D.I. \n57 at 14 (\u201cClaim 1 is a new apparatus for implementing systems on chips that enable the  user to \nachieve performance of fixed -function implementations at a lower cost.\u201d))   13 \n units can simultaneously receive instructions and data from the memory, process the data  and \noutput results.  ( See id., col s. 4:28- 37, 55:27- 30; see also  D.I. 57 at 12, 14 -15)   \n In sum, based on the record  before the Court, Netgear\u2019s step one arguments are not well \ntaken.  Th e patent indicates that claim 1 is not simply directed to the generic concept of \u201cdata \nprocessing\u201d writ large .  Instead, it is directed to a n apparatus that requires particular components  \nthat are configured in a particular way \u2014an apparatus  that the patent says helps improve the  way \ncomputers work.  As a resul t, Netgear\u2019s Motion must fail.  See, e.g., Visual Memory , 867 F.3d at \n1259- 60 (finding that the asserted claims survived step one of Alice , where the claims recited a \nmemory system with particular characteristics, and where t he specification described multiple \nbenefits that flowed from the improved memory system ); Thales Visionix Inc. v. United States , \n850 F.3d 1343, 1348- 49 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (explaining that the use of conventional sensors and a \nmathematical equation did not r ender the claims ineligible , where the claims required a particular \nconfiguration of the sensors and a particular way of using the resulting raw data that eliminated \nproblems inherent in prior art methods) ; Nw. Univ. , 2021 WL 4711538, at * 4-5 (finding that the \nclaims survived step one of Alice , where the invention utilized generic components organized in \na non- conventional way and where the plaintiff plausibly alleged how the invention improved \nupon the prior art ).  In light of this conclusion, the Court need not reach step two of the Alice \ninquiry.  See, e.g., Thales , 850 F.3d at 1349.5   \nIV. CONCLUSION For all of the above reasons, the Court recommends that Netgear\u2019s Motion be DEN IED.    \n \n5  Although Altair asserts that Netgear \u201chas raised several claim construction issues \nthat must be decided before the Court can rule on\u201d Netgear\u2019s Motion, (D.I. 57 at 8- 9), the Court \nagrees with Netgear that its claim construction proposals do not impact the outcome of the \nMotion, (D.I. 58 at 8- 9).   14 \n This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections \nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.  See Sincavage v. Barnhart , 171 F. App\u2019x \n924, 925 n.1 (3d Cir. 2006);  Hender son v. Carlson , 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).  \nThe parties are directed to the Court\u2019s Standing Order for Objections Filed Under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the District Court\u2019s website, located at http ://www.ded.uscourts.gov.   \nDated:  December 6, 2021    ______________                                                                             \n       Christopher J.
