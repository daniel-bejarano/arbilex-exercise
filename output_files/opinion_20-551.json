{"case_name": "Fundamental Innovation Systems International LLC v. Lenovo (United States), Inc. et al", "case_number": "20-551", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "11-23-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nFUNDAMENTAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS\n\nINTERNATIONAL LLC,\nPlaintiff,\nv. C.A. No. 20-551-CFC\nLENOVO (UNITED STATES), INC.; JURY TRIAL DEMANDED\n\nLENOVO HOLDING COMPANY INC.;\nLENOVO GROUP LTD., and MOTOROLA\nMOBILITY LLC,\n\nDefendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nThe parties in this patent case have jointly requested \u201cleave to present an\nearly summary judgment motion to the Court.\u201d D.I. 64 at 1. The parties say that\nresolution of the legal issue they wish to present in the motion \u201cwill clarify the\nscope of damages potentially at issue in the case and further the parties\u2019 settlement\ndiscussions.\u201d D.1. 64 at 1.\n\nAs a general rule, I do not allow for an early summary judgment motion\nunless the resolution of the motion would be case dispositive and the party seeking\nto file the motion agrees that it cannot file any other summary judgment motions.\nIn light of my case load, which approaches 600 civil cases (including 300 patent\ncases), and based on my own experiences as a judge and the experiences of other\n\njudges who sit and have sat on this Court, I have determined that without these two\nconditions early summary judgment motion practice is not an efficient use of my\ntime and efforts. I see no reason to depart from my general rule here.\n\nThe parties also state in their letter that \u201c[i]f the Court would prefer, the\nparties [will] consent to the motion being referred to Magistrate Judge Burke for a\nreport and recommendation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) and Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 72(b).\u201d D.I. 64 at 1. But I neither prefer nor need the parties to consent to the\nreferral of a summary judgment motion to a magistrate judge for a report and\nrecommendation. Referrals of matters to a magistrate judge pursuant to\n\u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) do not require the parties\u2019 consent. And the sad reality in patent\ncases filed in this district is that a referral of a summary judgment motion pursuant\nto \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) inevitably results in objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report\nand recommendation, which the district court judge must review de novo. Such a\nreferral therefore ends up doubling the amount of judicial resources needed to\nresolve the summary judgment motion in question. For that reason, I no longer\nmake \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) referrals of summary judgment motions in patent cases to a\nmagistrate judge.\n\nThe parties\u2019 consent is required for referrals of motions to a magistrate judge\npursuant to \u00a7 636(c). Under that section, a magistrate judge \u201cmay conduct any or\n\nall proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in\nthe case, when specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district\ncourt....\u201d Appeals of judgments entered by a magistrate judge pursuant to\n\n\u00a7 636(c) go directly to the Court of Appeals, and referrals of matters pursuant to\n\u00a7 636(c) therefore conserve this Court\u2019s limited and overtaxed resources.\n\nIf the parties wish to consent to a referral pursuant to \u00a7 636(c) of the\nsummary judgment motion they wish to present, I will make the referral. I will\nnot, however, agree to a referral that requires both a magistrate judge and a district\ncourt judge to expend time and effort addressing the merits of a summary judgment\nmotion.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington on this Twenty-third day of November\nin 2021, the parties\u2019 joint request for leave to present an early summary judgment\n\nmotion (D.I. 64) is DENIED.\n\naf\n\nChief Judge\n"}
