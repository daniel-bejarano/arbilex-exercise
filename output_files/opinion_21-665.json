GARNER , on behalf of \nhimself and all others similarly situ-\nated \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n \nGLOBAL  PLASMA  SOLUTIONS  INC.  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21-cv-00665-SB \n \nRobert J. Kriner, Jr., Scott M. Tucker, Tiffany Joanne Cramer, Timothy Mathews, \nCHIMICLES SCHWARTZ KRINER & DONALDSON -SMITH LLP,  Wilmington, Delaware; \nSteffan T.

Trent Taylor, M CGUIRE WOODS , Richmond, Virginia . \n \nCounsel for Defendant.  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nMarch 10, 2022  \n \n \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nWhen a crisis strikes, some people scramble to make a quick buck. Frightened \nmen are  easy targets . The COVID -19 pandemic is no different . Robert Garner  says \nhe bought an \u201cair ionizer\u201d  because he was told it would protect him . But h e has now \nseen scientific studies that suggest  that he was duped. So he sued the manufacturer, \nGlobal Plasma , for fraud, consumer -protection violations, breach  of warranty, and \nunjust enrichment. Because he identifies misrepresentations, his fraud claim sur-\nvives. But I dismiss his other claims.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn this motion to dismiss, I take the complaint\u2019s allegations as true. Like millions \nof Americans, Garner worried about catching COVID. Compl., D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  37, 146, 164 . \nHe was relieved to hear Global Plasma promising that its air ionizer could cleanse \nthe air of the virus   and other harmful compounds . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 56\u201357, 59, 148, 164 \u221266. So \nhe bought one. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 162\u201363, 170.  \nGlobal Plasma\u2019s products use \u201c [b]ipolar [i]onization technology\u201d to clean the air. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 48\u201349. This technology is \u201ccomplex ,\u201d so I will refer to the scientific studies Gar-\nner provides to describe it.  Trane  Technologies , A Taxonomy of Air -Cleaning Technol-\nogies Featuring Bipolar Ionization  3 (2021), D.I. 7- 1, exh. J; s ee Twardzik v. HP Inc. , \nNo. 1:21- cv-00396, at 11 (D. Del. Jan. 25, 2022) (reviewing a document linked in the \ncomplaint).   \nBipolar ionizers release ions into the air  to break up airborne contaminants. Trane  \nTechnologies  3\u20134. That effectively removes  \u201cdust, pollen, [and] dander\u201d from the air. \nId. at 4. But the jury is still out on whether ionizers can filter out smaller dangers. 3 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  98\u201399. Compare Trane  Technologies  8 (\u201c[W]e did not see efficacy for [small \nchemical compounds].\u201d), with  Yicheng Zeng et al., Evaluating a Commercially Avail-\nable In -Duct Bipolar Ionization Device for Pollutant Removal and Potential Byprod-\nuct Formation , Building & Enviro. 8 (Ma r. 7, 2021), D.I. 7 -1, exh. H (finding lower \ntotal compounds in the air with the ionizer than without).  \nIt is also unclear whether ionizers can screen out  airborne viruses. Global Plasma \nsponsored studies showing  that its ionizers could \u201ceffe ctively neutralize []\u201d COVID on \nsurfaces and in the air. Compl. \u00b6  62(j); see also id.  \u00b6\u00b6 62(f), 107 \u201308. But outside testing \nreached mixed  results. Two studies found no reduction of viruses on surfaces.  Another \nsaid it failed to cleanse the air  too. See Trane  Technologies  8 (noting that the technol-\nogy works for \u201cin -air pathogens\u201d but not for \u201cpathogens on surface [s]\u201d); Stephanie \nLicht et al ., Use of Bipolar Ionization for Disinfection Within Airplanes, Boeing 22 \n(2021), D.I. 7 -1, exh. I ( bipolar ionizers  have \u201cnot shown  significant disinfection\u201d).  \nThese studies dismayed Garner. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  149\u2013 51, 169 . He feared that an inef-\nfective  ionizer had lulled him into \u201ca false sense of security .\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 169. So he filed \nthis class action , claiming that Global Plasma deceived him and other consumers, \nbreached warranties,  violated consumer -protection laws,  and unjustly enriched itself. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 181\u2013279. He seeks damages and restitution. Id. \u00b6 280(c); see also D.I. 11, at 1 \nn.1 (withdrawing Garner\u2019s request for an injunction).  \nGlobal Plasma moves to dismiss .. D.I. 5. It says Garner lacks standing to seek \nindividual remedies or to bring claims on behalf of other consumers. D.I. 6, at 12 \u201314, \n21\u201322. And at any rate, it says, he has not stated a claim. Id. at 14 \u201321. 4 Global Plasma\u2019s standing arguments fail , but most of its merits contentions suc-\nceed.  So I dismiss all but Garner\u2019s misrepresentation claim, though I will let him \namend.  \nII. GARNER HAS STANDING  \nStart with standing. Global Plasma says Garner has not suffered an injury that \nmerits  damages or restitution. D.I. 6, at 12 \u201313. Plus, it argues , he cannot  represent \na multistate class when he is \u201cnot a resident of the other states. \u201d Id. at 21. Nor can \nhe represent people who purchased different Global Plasma ionizers . Id. at 13\u2013 14. \nBut these arguments all fail.  \nA. Individual remedies  \nGarner can personally seek damages and restitution because he plausibly pleads \nthat the ionizer did not do what he \u201cexpected it to do\u201d: cleanse the air. In re Johnson \n& Johnson Talcum Powder Prods. Marketing, Sales Practices & Liability Litig ., 903 \nF.3d 27 8, 283, 285, 292  (3d Cir. 2018); see Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  6, 13, 18, 160, 165\u2013 69. Had he \nknown that it would not sufficiently \u201cimprove air quality\u201d and protect him from \nCOVID, he would not have spent hundreds of dollars on it. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 163, 168, 170; see \nalso In re Joh nson & Johnson, 903 F.3d at 285 , 291\u2013 92. That suffices for standing . \nId.; Sierra Club v. Morton , 405 U.S. 727, 733\u2013 34 (1972) . \nB. Multistate class standing  \nGarner may also bring claims on behalf of a multistate class, at least at this stage. \nAny problem with raising claims under several states\u2019 laws goes to the propriety of \nclass certification, not standing. Twardzik , No. 1:21- cv-00396, at 7\u2013 8.  A plaintiff has \nstanding if he can show a  judicially redressable injury . Id. at 7. And a plaintiff\u2019s injury 5 is not pegged to the laws of different states : an injury is an injury even if no law allows  \nrecovery . Id. at 7\u20138. If Global Plasma worries about applying different state s\u2019 laws \ndown the road, it should oppose class certification. See id.  at 7 (citing Morrison v. YTB \nInt\u2019l, Inc. , 649 F.3d 533, 536 (7th Cir. 2011) ). \nC. Unbought  products  \nSimilarly, it is too early to lop off class claims for different Global Plasma ionizers. \nSee Compl. \u00b6  2 n.1.  Though Garner did not personally buy them, he may represent \nothers who did if their claims sufficiently resemble his. Lisowski v. Henry Thayer Co. , \n2021 WL 1185924, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 30, 2021).  \nAdmittedly, \u201ccase law in this area is sparse,\u201d and district courts are closely di-\nvided. Id. at *3. Some dismiss claims about products the plaintiff did not \u201cpurchase [] \nor use [].\u201d See, e.g. , Liberseon v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Cos. , 865 F. Supp. 2d \n529, 537  (D.N.J. 2011). Those courts reason that a plaintiff could not be \u201cpersonally \n\u2026 injured\u201d by those products. Id.  But o ther courts decide those questions only at the \ncertification stage.  Lisowski , 2021 WL 1185924, at *4. On a motion to dismiss, these \ncourts allow a case to proceed so long as the products, claims, and defendants are \n\u201csufficiently similar.\u201d Id. at 3 ( internal quotation marks omitted ). \nThis second line of  cases  persuades me . As those courts  point out, \u201cthere is a dis-\ntinction between  \u2026 the plaintiff\u2019s individual standing\u201d and \u201c[his] ability to represent \nabsent others \u201d in a class action . Id. A plaintiff may have a clear injury from one prod-\nuct. His ability to represent others who bought different products depends on how \nsimilar the products and claims are \u2014in other words, whether \u201cthere are questions of 6 law or fact common to the class.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23( a)(2). That is a certification prob-\nlem, not a standing one.  \nHere, the putative class\u2019s claims focus on misrepresentations about and deficien-\ncies in the bipolar -ionization technology used by all Global Plasma\u2019s ionizers , not the \nindividual products . See Compl. \u00b6  2 n.1. Thus, I will not dismiss the claims based on \nthe other ionizers  just yet . \nIII. GARNER SUFFICIENTLY PLEADS FRAUD  \nOn to the merits. Four of Garner\u2019s claims (fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudu-\nlent concealment, consumer protection violations, and unjust enrichment) \u201care based \non fraudulent activity.\u201d Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw, LLP , 1:21 -cv-00249, at 5\u2013 6 (D. Del. \nNov. 22, 2021) ; see Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  181\u201390, 254 \u201379. So they must meet  the heightened \npleading requirements of Rule 9(b), which requires plaintiffs  \u201calleging fraud\u201d to \u201cstate \n[their claims] with particularity.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b ). \nGarner identifies dozens of statements that he thinks are misleading. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 50\u201365. Global Plasma disagrees. It says none of the statements are deceptive . D.I. \n6, at 5\u201312. Plus, it adds, Garner never  explained how he was misled. Id.  at 116.  \nOnly some of Global Plasma\u2019s arguments succeed. I agree that some of the state-\nments are not actionable misrepresentations, but others are. So Garner\u2019s  misrepre-\nsentation claim survives, though his fraudulent -concealment, consumer -protection, \nand unjust -enrichment claims do not.  \nA. The statements  \nNot all misrepresentations merit a lawsuit . Actionable  statements  misstate \u201cma-\nterial facts \u201d that can be measured or known. Daniyan v. Viridian Energy LLC , 2015 7 WL 4031752, at *2  (D. Md. June 30, 2015). Mere \u201cestimate[s] or opinion [s] or puffing \u201d \nare not actionable.  Id. (quoting  Dean v. Beckley , 2010 WL 3928650, at *2 (D. Md. Oct. \n1, 2010) ).  \nMany statements Garner points to are mere puffery. Though too long  to be quoted \nhere, these statements can be neatly cat egorized.  \n1. Mission statements. Several statements describe Global Plasma\u2019s research \ngoals: developing safe technology, \u201cimproving indoor air quality,\u201d and countering the \npandemic. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  55(a), 58(a), 59(h)(ii), 62(a) \u2013(c) & (h). Garner might dispute \nGlobal Plasma\u2019s success in reaching those goals. Even so, they are only \u201cgeneral state-\nments regarding the [c]ompany\u2019s values and motivations, and thus, constitute puff-ery.\u201d Hall v. Johnson & Johnson, 2019 WL 7207491, at *15 (D.N.J. Dec. 27, 2019).  \n2. Generally safe. Another set of statements  are promises that Global Plasma\u2019s \nionizers are generally \u201csafe for occupied spaces.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  55(b), 58(b)  & (d) . State-\nments promising safety might be actionable, if specific enough (more on that later). Fusco v. Uber Tech., Inc. , 2018 WL 3618232, at *6 (E.D. Pa. July 27, 2018). But  a \ngeneral promise that a product is \u201csafe\u201d is too general to be tested in court : \u201cthere is \nno way to prove that a product is \u2026 in the abstract, safe.\u201d Id.  (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). Thus, these statements are also puffery.  \n3. Peace of m ind. Finally, one statement promises that the ionizers can give \u201cpeace \nof mind during thi s evolving pandemic.\u201d Compl. \u00b6  62(b). But like promises of general \nsafety, promises that a product \u201cwill alleviate worry\u201d are not \u201cobjectively 8 measurable.\u201d ConsulNet Computing, Inc. v. Moore, 2007 WL 2702446, at *9\u2013 10 (E.D. \nPa. Sept. 12, 2007)  (internal qu otation marks omitted) . \nOther statements are measurable but not clearly false:   \n4. Descriptions of b ipolar ionization . Global Plasma said  its products  send ions \n\u201cout into [a] space\u201d to \u201cseek[ ]\u2026 out contaminants.\u201d Compl. \u00b6  55(c). \u201c[W]hen ions come \ninto cont act with  pathogens  \u2026, they disrupt the [contaminants\u2019] surface proteins  \u2026 \nrender[ing] them inactive.\u201d Compl. \u00b6  62(f); see also id.  \u00b6\u00b6 56(c), 62(d). Garn er cites \nstudies that  challenge how effective that process is, but he does not dispute that bi-\npolar ionization works that way. See, e.g.,  Licht et al. at 3 \u20134; Trane  Technologies  at \n3\u20134. \n5. Ozone -free. A few more statements promise that the ionizers are safe because \nthey do not produ ce harmful ozone. Compl. \u00b6  58(e), (g) & (h); see also id. \u00b6  57(b)(1) & \n(3), (c ), (e)\u2013 (g) (promising, in part, that the ionizers do not produce ozone). These \nsafety claims \u201ccan be prove[n] true or false,\u201d so they are not puffery.  Fusco , 2018 WL \n3618232, at *6. But Garner  does not allege that these statements are false. His stud-\nies conclude that Global Plasma\u2019s ionizer does not emit ozone. Trane Technologies  at \n5; Licht et al. at 16; Zeng et al. at 11 . \n6. Cleaner a ir. Another group of statements promise that the ionizer cleans air. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  58(c), 59(a), (c) \u2013(g). Again, Garner does not allege that this is false. His \nstudies say  that though the ionizers might multiply some chemicals, they apparently \nfilter out more than they add. See Zeng et al. at 8; Trane  Technologies  at 8. 9 7. Odor -reducing . Other statements promise that the ionizer can neutralize odors. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  56(a) \u2013(b), 57(b)(2). But neither Garner \u2019s studies  nor his complaint say  that \nthis is false.  \n8. Testimonials. Finally, Garner quotes some glowing testimonials about the io n-\nizer\u2019s effectiveness. Apparently, at some installations, the ionizer \u201ceffectively neutral-\nized odors,\u201d \u201creduce[d] pathogens,\u201d and cleansed the space. Compl. \u00b6  60(a), (c)\u2013 (d). \nThese testimonials may be unrepresentative. Garner suggests as much. Id.  \u00b6 60. But \nhe does not say they are false . He does not , for instance,  suggest  that they were fab-\nricated or bought. Cf. Morgan v. Markerdowne Corp. , 201 F.R.D. 341, 345 (D.N.J. \n2001);  In re Milestone Sci . Sec. Litig. , 183 F.R.D. 404, 410 (D.N.J. 1998);  FTC v. Roca \nLabs, Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d 1375, 1389 (M.D. Fla. 2018).  \nBut a handful of statements are at least arguably false :  \n9. Third -party testing . First, Garner protests Global Plasma\u2019s depiction of commis-\nsioned tests as \u201cindependent.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  55(d), 60(b), 61, 62(e), (g), (k). Tests can \nhardly be independent, he says, if they were \u201cfunded by [Global Plasma].\u201d Id.  \u00b6 150; \nsee id. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 53, 118.  \nIndeed, Global Plasma needed to disclose its relationship with the testers. See \nRoca Labs, 345 F. Supp. 3d  at 1389. Granted, it apparently did for some tests . See, \ne.g., Compl. \u00b6  62(j) n.78; News Release, GPS Virtually Eliminates Static SARS -CoV-\n2 with Proprietary NPBI Technology  (June 10, 2020), https://perma.cc/WVW3 -XPRG \n(acknowledging that Global Plasma \u201cjointly executed\u201d the test with the third -party \ntester).  10 But some disclosures are buried;  others, nonexistent.  For instance, Global \nPlasma\u2019s \u201cIndependent Testing \u201d webpage did not mention that it had commissioned \nany of the studies touted. See D.I. 7 -1, exh. C. True, it  says that information could be \nfound by digging into the studies themselves. D.I. 6, at 8. But in other areas of the \nlaw, burying facts is insufficient disclosure. See, e.g., Werner v. Werner, 267 F.3d 288, \n297 (3d Cir. 2001); Am. Orthopedic & Sports Medicine v. Indep. Blue Cross Blue \nShield , 890 F. 3d 445, 452 n.6 (3d Cir. 2018).  So at this stage, Garner plausibly points \nto a misrepresentation.  \n10. No harmful byproducts.  Global Plasma also promised that the ionizer produces \nno \u201charmful byproducts.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  55(e), 56(d), 57 (a)\u2013(g), 59(b), (i). Instead, it is sup-\nposed to break down compounds into some combination  of the \u201cfour basic elements: \noxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxi de or water vapor.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 57(a).  \nBut Garner cites a study suggesting  that the ionizer might produce other chemi-\ncals too. Zeng et al. at 8\u20139, 11 \u201312. At least some of those chemicals might be harmful, \nif produced in sufficient quantities. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  80\u201386. \nGlobal Plasma retorts  that the study never  says the chemicals  reach those levels.  \nD.I. 6, at 7. But focusing on the levels produced shifts the goalposts: Global Plasma \npromised that its ionizer would release no other byproducts. Thus, its promises ap-\npear false.  \n11. Proven a gainst COVID.  Finally, Global Plasma labeled its ionizers \u201ca proven \ntool in the fight  against COVID -19.\u201d Id. \u00b6 62(i). And it suggested the ionizers could \nfilter COVID out of the air and disinfe ct surfaces. See also id. \u00b6\u00b6 59(h)(i), 62(d). But 11 two studies contradict these claims . Each conclude s that the ionizers likely would not \ndisinfect surfaces. Trane  Technologies  8; Licht et al. 16. And they reached incon-\nsistent results about viruses in the air. Compare Trane  Technologies  8, with Licht et \nal. 22.  \nTrue, as Global Plasma points out, these stud ies are \u201c inconclusive. \u201d D.I. 6, at 9  \n(quoting Licht et al.) . And its own studies concluded differently. Id.  But I must leave \nthe scientific debate for a later stage. Cf. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharma., 509 U.S. \n579 (1993). At this point, Garner plausib ly identifie s a misrepresentation.  \nTo summarize , Garner  has identified three potential misrepresentations: (1) that \nGlobal Plasma used independent testing, (2) that its ionizers give off only four  by-\nproducts, and (3) that they are effective at stopping C OVID.  \nBut no matter, Global Plasma says. Garner has  not pled the other elements of his \nfraud- based claims.  I turn ther e next.  \nB. Garner\u2019s fraudulent -misrepresentation claim survives  \nGlobal Plasma lobs two  more  attacks at Garner\u2019s fraudulent -misrepresentation \nclaim . Cf. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  181\u201390. Both fail.  \nFirst, it says,  Garner has not sufficiently described how he relied on its misstate-\nments. D.I. 6, at 16; see Won Kim v. US \u20131 Flea Mkt.  LLC, 2018 WL 1791916, at *3 \n(Md. Ct. Spec.  App. Apr. 16, 2018) (misrepresentation elements).  \nNot so . After quoting the misstatements at length, Garner says he \u201cobserved and \nread\u201d them on \u201c[Global Plasma\u2019s] website  \u2026 and social media.\u201d Compl. \u00b6  165. Cf. \nTwardzik , No. 1:21- cv-00396, at 11 (dismissing  claim  because plaintiff  did not say he \nhad seen defendant\u2019s marketing);  Hill v. Brush Engineered Materials, Inc. , 383 F. 12 Supp. 2d 814, 823 (D. Md. 2005) (dismissing because plaintiff failed to describe \u201chow \nshe came to rely on \u201d defendant\u2019s misrepresentations ). These statements \u2014particu-\nlarly the ones promising that the ionizer could mitigate COVID \u2014persuaded him to \nbuy it. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  1, 165.  At this stage, that is enough to show reliance. Cf. Snyder v. \nCynosure, Inc. , 2019 WL 1386727, at *6 (D. Md. Mar. 27, 2019).  \nSecond, Global Plasma argues that Garner could not have reasonably  relied on its \nstatements because its \u201cwebsite is replete with disclaimers.\u201d D.I. 6, at 9 \u201310, 16. But \nit is unclear whether those disclaimers were posted to G lobal Plasma\u2019s website when \nGarner visited it \u2014his complaint never mentions them.  \nEven  if they were, the disclaimers are too general to disclaim th e actionable mis-\nstatements . Cf. EP Medsystems, Inc. v. EchoCath, Inc. , 235 F.3d 865, 873 (3d Cir. \n2000) (requiring disclaimers in securities cases to be \u201ctailored\u201d to the misstatements  \n(internal quotation marks omitted) ). At most, the disclaimers warn clients to \u201cevalu-\nate their individual \u2026 conditions when making an assessment regarding the [ion-\nizer\u2019s] potential benefits.\u201d Global Plasma Solutions, Disclaimers, \nhttps://perma.cc/E546 -XMUP ; see also Global Plasma Solutions, Third -Party Testing , \nhttps://perma.cc/UFK6 -BLQB (linking to the disclaimer) . So that attack flops too. \nGarner\u2019s misrepresentation claim may move forward.  \nC. Garner\u2019s fraudulent -concealment claim fails  \nBut Garner\u2019s other fraud- based claims run into trou ble. Start with fraudulent con-\ncealment. Cf. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  181\u201390; Rhee v. Highland Dev.  Corp. , 958 A.2d 385, 390 (Md. \nCt .Spec. App. 2008) (fraudulent concealment elements). To state that claim, Garner \nmust to plead \u201cthat [Global Plasma] took affirmative action to conceal\u201d facts  13 undermining its claims . My Nat\u2019l Tax & Ins. Servs., Inc. v. H & R Block Tax Servs., \nInc., 839 F. Supp. 2d 816, 820 (D. Md. 2012)  (quoting Lloyd v. Gen. Motors Corp. , 916 \nA.2d 257, 275 (M d. 2007) ). \nHe does not. Instead,  he claims that Global Plasma sued its critics. Compl. \u00b6  142 \n& n.137. A frivolous lawsuit could perhaps be an \u201caffirmative action,\u201d if its only pur-\npose was to silence detractors . But Garner does not provide enoug h information about \nthese suits to indicate whether that is true here. Besides, most lawsuits are \u201c matters \nof public record\u201d  that hardly  \u201cconceal  \u2026 relevant fact[s].\u201d Finley Alexander Wealth \nManagement, LLC v.  M&O Mktg. , Inc. , 2021 WL 1215769, at *10 (D. Md. Mar. 31, \n2021) (cleaned up). So I must dismiss Garner\u2019s  fraudulent -concealment claim.  \nD. Garner\u2019s consumer -protection claim  fails too \nNext, Global Plasma targets Garner\u2019s consumer -protection claim. D.I. 6, at 19 \u201320; \nCompl. \u00b6 \u00b6 254\u201370. Under Maryland\u2019s consumer- protection statute, a consumer can \nsue for \u201c[u]nfair, abusive, or deceptive trade practices,\u201d including misleading market-\ning. Md. Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1) \u2013(3), (5), (9), 13 -408.  \nGarner satisfies many  of this cla im\u2019s requirements. As I have explained, he iden-\ntifies misleading marketing, his reliance on it, and a resulting injury . Bey v. Shapiro \nBrown & Alt, LLP , 997 F. Supp. 2d 310, 319 (D. Md. 2014).  \nBut Garner falters on a threshold condition : only a b uyer  of consumer goods can \nsue for consumer -protection violations . Yet Garner has not shown that the ionizer is \na \u201cconsumer good []\u201d: something bought \u201cprimarily for personal, household, family, or \nagricultural purposes.\u201d  Md. Code Ann., Com.  Law \u00a7 13-101(d)(1);  D.I. 6, at 19 \u201320.  14 To determine whether a product would be used for those purposes,  Maryland \ncourts look to the buyer\u2019s intent. Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving , 667 A.2d 624, \n635 (Md. Ct. App. 1995). If a buyer plans to use the product in his home, that product \nbecomes a consumer good, even if other buyers would use it differently. Id .  \nYet Garner never says how he planned to use the ion izer. True, his complaint \nsuggests that some buyers might have installed an ionizer in their homes. Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 7, 43, 45. But he also notes that many buyers bought an ionizer for their busi-\nnesses. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 144\u201345, 147, 152\u2013 55. And he does not clarify  which ca mp he falls into, \naside from a conclusory statement that he \u201cis a consumer\u201d and the ionizer is a con-sumer good. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 263\u201364; see generally id. \u00b6\u00b6 146, 148, 162 \u201371. \nSo I must dismiss this claim. If Garner bought the ionizer for use in his home, he \nshould amend his complaint to say so.  \nE. Unjust enrichment  \nThat leaves  Garner\u2019s claim that his purchase unjustly enriched Global Plasma. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 271\u201379. To state that claim, Garn er must plead that Global Plasma \u201cholds [his] \nmoney and that it would be unconscionable  [for them] \u2026 to retain it.\u201d Bank of Am. \nCorp. v. Gibbons , 918 A.2d 565, 569 ( Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2007)  (quoting Plitt v. Green-\nberg,  219 A.2d 237 (Md. 1966) ). \nHe has not.  Garner bought the ionizer from a third -party retailer and has not said  \nwhether the proceeds from that sale ended up in Global Plasma\u2019s hands. Compl. \u00b6 162; D.I. 6, at 20 \u201321. At most, he implies that Global Plasma made more mon ey \nbecause retailers could sell its products. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  275\u201379. 15 Yet that is not enough. True, Garner need not show \u201cdirect dealings\u201d with Global \nPlasma to state a valid claim. Gibbons , 918 A.2d at 571\u2013 72. But he still must allege \nthat Global Plasma got his money in the end. Id.  at 572; Newcomb v. Babu , 2020 WL \n5106714, at *5 (D. Md. Aug. 30, 2020) (asking whether  the defendant had \u201cfunds \ntransferred to it\u201d)  (cleaned up). Vague implicat ions do not suffice. So I will dismiss \nthis claim too.  \nIV. GARNER DOES NOT PLAUSIBLY PLEAD BREACHES OF WARRANTY  \nAlong with  his fraud -based claims, Garner brings several claims for breach of war-\nranty. For these, he need only state enough facts to make his  claim plausible. Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007).  But he fails.  \nGarner needed to plead that his notice \u201cinformed [Global Plasma] that there was \na breach\u201d and described the \u201cnature of the nonconformity.\u201d Doll v. Ford Motor Co. , \n814 F. Supp. 2d 526, 542 (D. Md. 2011) ; see Md. Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7  2-607(3)(a);  \nPalmer v. CVS Health , 2019 WL 6529163, at *6 & n.17 (D. Md. Dec. 4, 2019).  But he \ndoes not. He says only that he \u201csent pre -suit notice concerning the [ionizer\u2019s] defects.\u201d \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  171, 203,  219, 221, 252 \u201353. And t hat conclusory statement is not enough. \nDoll, 814 F. Supp. 2d at 542 (rejecting  the conclusory statement that plaintiffs had \nprovided notice of \u201cthe problems they experienced\u201d) . Id.  \nGranted, Garner\u2019s brief discusses  his notice. See D.I. 7 -1, exh. K; D.I. 11, at 17 \u2013\n18. But I cannot consider that information because it is neither provided by nor inte-\ngral to Garner\u2019s complaint. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, \n1426 (3d Cir. 1997) . Garner should amend his complaint to include it.  16 Garner\u2019s final claim for violations of  the Magnuson- Moss Warranty  Act also fails. \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6  223\u201338. As I recently explained, Magnuson -Moss permits class actions  in \nfederal court only where there are 100 named plaintiffs. Talley v. General Motors, No. \n1:20- cv-01137, at 12\u2013 15 (D. Del. Nov. 26, 2021) ; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  2310( d)(3)(C). Because \nGarner is the sole plaintiff here, I cannot hear his claim.  \n* * * * * \nGarner identifies several potential misrepresentations. So he successfully states \na fraudulent -misrepresentation claim. But his other claims are faulty , so I must dis-\nmiss them. If Garner wants to mend those flaws, he should amend.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nROBERT S. GARNER, on behalf of \nhimself and all others similarly situ-\nated \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nGLOBAL  PLASMA  SOLUTIONS  INC.  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21-cv-00665-SB \n \n \n  ORDER  \n1. I GRANT  IN PART and DENY IN PART  Global Plasma\u2019s motion to dismiss \n[D.I. 5]. I dismiss without prejudice Counts II, III, IV, V, VI VII, and VIII.
