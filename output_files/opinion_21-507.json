IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCivil Action No. 21-507-RGA \nPELOTON INTERACTIVE , INC., \nDefendant . \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint. (D.I. 13). \nI have reviewed the parties' briefing. (D.I. 14, 17, 18). For the reasons that follow, this motion \nis GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn April 7, 2021, Plaintiff iFIT Inc. 1 filed this action against Defendant Peloton \nInteractive, Inc. alleging that Peloton's Bike+ directly infringes U.S. Patent No. 10,864,407 (\"the \n'407 patent\"). (D.I. 1). Peloton moved to dismiss iFIT's claim for enhanced damages for \nfailure to state a claim. (D.I. 8). Specificall y, Peloton argued that the original complaint \ncontained no allegations of willful infringement. (D.I. 9 at 4). Rather than oppose the motion, \niFIT filed its First Amended Complaint. (D.I. 11). In its First Amended Complaint, iFIT \nalleges: \"Peloton was aware of the application which led to the '407 Patent at the \n1 At the time the original complaint was filed, Plaintiff was named ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. \nOn August 9, 2021, ICON changed its name to iFIT Inc. (D.I. 19). \n1 commencement of the 1386 action2 between [iFIT] and Peloton where [iFIT] asserted U.S. \nPatent 10,293,211, of which the '407 Patent is a continuation ,\" (id. at ,r 29); \"At the latest, \nPeloton became aware of the '407 Patent when this action was served,\" (id. at ,r 30); \"Despite \nPeloton's prior knowledge of the '407 Patent, including but not limited to knowledge of the '407 \nPatent as a result of [iFIT] 's original complaint , Peloton continues to market and sell the \ninfringing Bike+ product,\" (id. at ,r 31); and \"Peloton's ongoing infringement is willful.\" (Id. at ,r \n39). Peloton filed a second motion to dismiss iFIT's claims for willful infringement and \nenhanced damages in the First Amended Complaint. (D.I. 13). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. Clv. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) allows the \naccused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard. A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint \nas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant , a court concludes that \nthose allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Willful Infringement \nA determination of willfulness requires a finding of \"deliberate or intentional \" \ninfringement. SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 14 F.4th 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021). A \nfinding of \"subjective willfulness ,\" proof that the accused infringer acted in the face of a risk of \n2 iFIT Inc. v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., No. 20-1386-RGA. \n2 infringement that was \"either known or so obvious that it should have been known to the accused \ninfringer,\" can satisfy this standard. WesternGeco L.L.C. v. ION Geophysical Corp., 837 F.3d \n1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 579 U.S. 93, 101 \n(2016)), rev'd on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 2129 (2018). Therefore , to plead a claim of willful \ninfringement , the complaint must allege that the accused infringer knew of the patent-in-suit, and \nknowingly or intentionally infringed the patent after acquiring that knowledge. Eko Brands, \nLLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., 946 F.3d 1367, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \nPeloton argues that iFIT fails to allege knowledge of the asserted patent sufficient to \nsupport a claim for willful infringement. (D.I. 14 at 5). iFIT alleges that Peloton had pre-suit \nknowledge of the '407 patent because it knew of the patent application that later issued as the \n'407 patent. (D .I. 11 at ,r 29). Knowledge of a patent application alone, however, is not \nenough to establish knowledge of the patent(s) that issued from that application and therefore not \nenough to establish willfulness . State Indus., Inc. v. A.O. Smith Corp., 751 F.2d 1226, 1236 \n(Fed. Cir. 1985); NexStep, Inc. v. Comcast Cable Commc 'ns, LLC, 2019 WL 5626647, at *3 (D. \nDel. Oct. 31, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 11663798 (D. Del. Nov. 15, \n2019). As the Federal Circuit has noted, \nTo willfully infringe a patent, the patent must exist and one must have knowledge \nof it. . . . Filing an application is no guarantee any patent will issue and a very \nsubstantial percentage of applications never result in patents. What the scope of \nclaims in patents that do issue will be is something totally unforeseeable . \nState Indus., 751 F.2d at 1236. Thus, iFIT's allegation that Peloton was aware of the '407 \npatent application six months prior to this suit is insufficient to support iFIT' s willfulness claim. \niFIT also alleges that Peloton knew of the '407 patent as of the filing of its original \ncomplaint. (D.I. 11 at ,r 30). I think this is irrelevant. My view is that an amended complaint \n3 cannot rely upon the original complaint as a basis to allege knowledge for a willful infringement \nclaim. Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook , Inc., 2021 WL 4477022, at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). Thus, \niFIT has failed to sufficiently allege knowledge of the asserted patent to support its willful \ninfringement claim. \nEven if iFIT had sufficiently alleged knowledge of the '407 patent, mere knowledge of \nthe patent cannot support an allegation of willful infringement. Evonik Degussa GmbH v. \nMateria, Inc., 305 F. Supp. 3d 563,577 (D. Del. 2018). iFIT must plead both knowledge of the \npatent and of the infringement. Id. iFIT alleges that despite Peloton's knowledge of the patent, \nit continues to sell the infringing Bike+ product. (D .I. 11 at ,r 31 ). This is insufficient. The \nFederal Circuit has instructed , \"Knowledge of the asserted patent and evidence of infringement is \nnecessary, but not sufficient, for a finding of willfulness. Rather, willfulness requires deliberate \nor intentional infringement.\" Bayer Healthcare LLC v. Baxa/ta Inc., 989 F.3d 964,988 (Fed. \nCir. 2021 ). iFIT has failed to allege that Peloton knowingly or intentionally infringed the \npatent as is required to state a claim for willfulness. \nIn sum, iFIT has failed to state a claim for willful infringement because it has failed to \nplead that Peloton knew of the '407 patent and that Peloton knew of any alleged infringement. \nThus, I will grant Peloton's motion to dismiss iFIT's claim for willful infringement in the First \nAmended Complaint . \nB. Enhanced Damages \nI am not prepared to say that a finding of willfulness at trial is an absolute prerequisite to \nan award of enhanced damages. The Supreme Court has held that \"we eschew any rigid \nformula for awarding enhanced damages under\u00a7 284.\" Halo, 579 U.S. at 107. And, \n4 \"enhanced damages _ .. _. should generally be reserved for egregious cases typified by willful \nmisconduct.\" Id. at 106 (emphasis added). What if the defendant's witnesses perjure \nthemselves in depositions and then at trial? There is no reason to expect that in this case, but, as \nin any case, at the pleading stage, no one knows what will happen as the case progresses. That \nis why every case has boilerplate claims that the case is an exceptional case and the party should \nbe awarded its attorneys ' fees. We do not require any factual allegations supporting the \nplausibility of this assertion . \nThe parties do not cite any controlling case stating that a trial verdict of willfulness is an \nabsolute prerequisite to an award of enhanced damages. Indeed, Peloton's brief concedes the \npossibility that there could be some other sort of egregious behavior that would be the basis for \nenhanced damages. (D.I. 14 at 7). Since I do not think a plaintiff has to plead anything in \nsupport of a boilerplate claim of enhanced damages , and since I cannot rule out what a defendant \nmight later do, I will deny the motion to dismiss iFIT' s claim of enhanced damages. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the reasons discussed above, I will GRANT in part and DENY in part Defendant 's \nMotion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint. (D.I. 13). Plaintiff's claim for willful \ninfringement is DISMISSED. \nEntered this~day of January, 2022. \n5 "}
