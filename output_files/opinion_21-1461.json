Because CCM and \nSummit Power Group do not have standing to bring their counterclaims, I grant the \nUnited States\u2019 motion to dismiss.  \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nIn 2002, the United States started  a Clean Coal Power Initiative to subsidiz e \nclean -energy projects. ECF No.  10, at 3\u20134 (CCM Answer) .2 On January 29, 2010, the \nDepartment of Energy (Energy) and Summit Texas Clean Energy, LLC  (Summit)  \nentered into a Cooperative Agreement \u201cto build a facility that would capture and \nsequester, or otherwise put to beneficial use, 90 percent of the carbon dioxide \ngenerated by a coal -fired power plant.\u201d Id.  at 5\u20136. Under the Cooperative Agreement, \nEnergy wo uld conditionally subsidize $350 million of the $1.726 billion project , \ndivid ing and distribut ing the subsidy  among four phases  of the project . Id. at 7\u20138; \nECF No.  1 (Complaint ), Ex. 1, at 7 . Energy committed $15 million  of the $350 million \nsubsidy  for the  first phase. Complaint , Ex. 1, at 7.  \n \n1 For purposes of this  motion to dismiss, I adopt CCM and SPG\u2019s allegations as true. \nMortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n , 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977).  \n2  CCM and SPG separately responded to the United States\u2019 complaint. ECF No.  10 \n(CCM \u2019s Answer ); ECF No.  11 ( SPG\u2019s Answer ). Because their responses  are \nsubstantially identical, I cite to only CCM\u2019s answer. For the same reason , I cite to \nonly the United States\u2019 opening brief that is directed to CCM. See ECF No.  20 \n(moving to dismiss CCM\u2019s counterclaims); ECF No.  21 (mo ving to dismiss SPG\u2019s \ncounterclaims).     \n \n3 Energy amended the Cooperative Agreement  several times to extend  the first-\nphase deadline  and to give Summit accelerated  first-phase  funding that Summit \nwould have to repay if the parties terminated or discontinued the  project. Id. at 12, \n14. With the extended deadline approaching, Energy was allegedly \u201c concerned that \nSummit could not meet its obligation \u2014if the project ended \u2014to repay\u201d the accelerated \nfunding, which had reached $16 million.  Complaint , at 6. Energy agreed to further \nextend the first -phase deadline if Summit would secure repayment via third party \nguarantors. CCM Answer, at 13 \u201315. Accordingly, Summit engaged CCM TCEP, LLC \nand Summit Power Group, LL C (SPG)\u2014the defendants in the  present action \u2014\u201cto \nenter into separate guaranties, each titled a \u2018Payment Agreement.\u2019\u201d Id.  at 14. \nUnder CCM\u2019s Payment Agreement, CCM would commit to a collateral account \n$6 million that would issue to Energy if Energy or Summit  discontinued the \nCooperative Agreement. Co mplaint , Ex. 3, at 1. And under SPG\u2019s two Payment \nAgreements, SPG would commit a total of $7.8 million. Complaint , Ex. 4, at 1; \nComplaint , Ex. 5, at 1 . \nEnergy continued to extend the deadline for Summit to complete the first \nphase  of the project  and contin ued to supply Summit with additional first -phase \nfunding . CCM Answer , at 16 \u201317, 36. By September 2015, Summit had nearly finished \nthe first phase , needing only to  execute construction contracts. Id. at 40. Summit \nrequested additional funding  and time  to finish this last step , but also told Energy \nthat it \u201cwould be willing to end the Project.\u201d Id.  at 40\u201341. Energy chose to proceed.    \n \n4 Id. at 41. By the end of 2015, Energy had given  Summit $104 million to fu nd the first \nphase  of the project . Id. at 17.  \n\u201cIn early 2016, without prior warning,\u201d Energy \u201cabruptly discontinued its \ncollaboration and support for\u201d the project, proposed to deobligate money  from Clean \nCoal Power Initiative projects that had not reached financial close,  id. at 42\u2013 43, and \n\u201cinternally instructed its staff to cease communications with\u201d participants of the \nTexas Clean Energy Project , id. at 33. Summit wrote to Energy to try to convince it \nnot to  deobligat e funds and informed Energy \u201cthat achi eving financial close would be \nimpossible without [g]overnment support and funding.\u201d Id.  at 43. On March 22, 2016, \nthe then- Secretary  of Energy  testified before Congress that Summit had not met its \nmilestones. Id. at 33, 44. On June 10, 2016, Energy notified the parties that it \nintended to discontinue the Cooperative Agreement , which it did  on August 23, 2016. \nId. at 18\u201319; Complaint , Ex. 9. The defendants  characterize Energy\u2019s actions as a \n\u201cpublic and private withdrawal of support and collaboration ,\u201d CCM Answer, at 44,  \nthat \u201chad devastating commercial impacts ,\u201d id. at 33 .  \nSummit has since filed for bankruptcy and has not repaid the $13.8 million \nguaranteed  by CCM and SPG. Id.  at 20 . The United States sued CCM and SPG for \nthe $13.8 million allegedly o wed.  Complaint , at 9\u201310. CCM and SPG countersued, \narguing  that Energy had breached the Cooperative Agreement, breached the implied \nduty of good faith and fair dealing, and impaired CCM\u2019s and SPG\u2019s surety status es. \nCCM Answer, at 46\u2013 48. The United States moves to dismiss CCM and SPG\u2019s    \n \n5 counterclaims under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). ECF No.  20, \nat 1. \nThis court has  subject matter jurisdiction over the United States\u2019 claims under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1345, and venue is proper because the defendants are incorporated in \nDelaware. See CCM Answer, at 2 \u20133.  \nII. LEGAL  STANDARD \nFederal law typically governs contracts with the government , Prudential Ins. \nCo. of Am. v. United States, 801 F.2d 1295, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 1986) , and  the Paym ent \nAgreements specifically provide that they are governed by  federal law , e.g., \nComplaint , Ex. 3, at 5. Under federal law, a party has standing if it is in privity  of \ncontract  with the government or is a third -party beneficiary  to a government contract . \nSullivan v. United States , 625 F.3d 1378, 1379\u2013 80 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see P a. Psychiatric \nSoc\u2019y v. Green Spring Health Servs., Inc. , 280 F.3d 278, 288 (3d Cir. 2002) (\u201c[O]ur \njurisprudence recognizes third- party standing under certain circumstances.\u201d).  \nTo establish third -party -beneficiary status, \u201c a party must demonstrate that \nthe contract not only reflects the express or implied intention to benefit the party, but \nthat it reflects an intention to benefit the party directly.\u201d Flexfab, LLC v. United \nStates, 424 F.3d 1254, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2005)  (citation omitted) . Third- party -\nbeneficiary status is an \u201cexceptional privilege\u201d that arises only  if the contract \u201cclearly \nintend [s] to . . . benefit\u201d a  third party. Id. at 1259 \u201360 (citations omitted ).    \n \n6 III. DISCUSSION  \nA. Cooperative Agreement  \nThe government argues that the defendants do not have standing to sue under \nthe Cooperative Agreement because they are not parties to that agreement.  ECF \nNo. 20, at 12. The defendants assert  that they are parties to the Cooperative \nAgreement because  the Cooperative and Payment Agreements incorporate each \nother.  ECF No.  24, at 17. The government rejects this assertion, arguing that \u201ca \nguaranty is a derivative liability that does not make one a party to the underlying \nagreement and does not give standing to sue.\u201d  ECF No.  27, at  9.  \nThe defendants are not in privity with the gove rnment  as to the Cooperative \nAgreement . The Cooperative Agreement identifies points of contact for only Energy \nand Summit  and says that the contract was \u201cawarded to\u201d Summit, indicating that \nEnergy and Summit  are the only parties to the original agreement . Complaint , Ex. 1, \nat 3.  And the incorporation of the Payment Agreements into the Cooperative \nAgreement does not add to or otherwise modify the parties in the Cooperative \nAgreement. The Payment Agreements explicitly recognize  that only Summit and \nEnergy are  parties to the Cooperative Agreement.  E.g., Complaint , Ex. 3, at 1  \n(\u201cWHEREAS, STCE and DOE are parties to  . . . the \u2018Cooperative Agreement\u2019.\u201d). And \nthe modification to the Cooperative Agreement that incorporates  the Payment \nAgreements state s that its purpose is only  \u201cto recognize and incorporate certain \ntranches of security  . . . with respect to the potential repayment of certain accelerated \nreimbursement payments\u201d and that \u201cALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS    \n \n7 REMAIN UNCHANGED.\u201d Complaint , Ex. 6, at 3; Complain t, Ex. 7, at 3 \u20134. Because \nthe Cooperative Agreement is between only Energy and Summit, and because the \nPayment Agreements did not amend the Cooperative Agreement to make CCM or \nSPG parties, the defendants are not in privity with the government as to the \nCooperative Agreement.  \nThe defendants argue in the alternative that they are , at the very least , third-\nparty beneficiaries of the Cooperative Agreement because the government and \nSummit intended for the defendants to benefit from that agreement . ECF No.  24, \nat 18\u201319. The government disagrees , asserting that the defendants , in their answers  \nto the government\u2019s complaint , \u201cdo[] not even allege that [they are] the intended \nthird- party beneficiar[ies] of the Cooperative Agreement,\u201d  and that \u201cthe indisputable  \nnature of the Cooperative Agreement  . . . does not express any intent to benefit [the \ndefendants] directly.\u201d  ECF No. 20, at 12 \u201313. \nThe defendants are not third -party beneficiaries of  the Cooperative \nAgreement. The Cooperative Agreement does not explicitly  name any third -party \nbeneficiaries, so the agreement must imply an intention to  directly  benefit the \ndefendants for the defendants to obtain third -party -beneficiary  status . Flexfab , 424 \nF.3d at 1259 \u201360. It does not . As shown by Mid -State Fertilizer v. Exc hange National \nBank of Chicago , 877 F.2d 1333 (7th Cir. 1989) and Bank of America, FSB v. United \nStates, 55 Fed. Cl. 670 (2003) , merely serving as guarantor does not give rise to third -\nparty -beneficiary status.     \n \n8 In Mid-State Fertilizer, Mid- State Fertilizer contracted with the Exchange \nNational Bank of Chicago for credit.  877 F.2d at 1333. Lasley and Maxine Kimmel \nserved as guarantors  to Mid- State Fertilizer\u2019s obligations under that contract . Id. \nat 1334.  The Seventh Circuit determined that the Kim mels did not have standing to \nsue the Bank for \u201cviolat[ing] statutory and contractual duties owed to Mid- State\u201d \nFertilizer . Id. at 1336.  \nThe Seventh Circuit reasoned  that allowing the Kimmels  to sue under the \noriginal contract  between Mid -State Fertilizer  and the Bank  could lead to a  double \ncounting of damages. Id.  at 1335\u2013 36. Analogiz ing to investors , the court explained \nthat \u201c[a] fire that causes $100 worth of damage to \u2018the corporation\u2019, and therefore \nreduces the value of investors\u2019 stock by $100, does not cause a total injury of $200\u2014\nthe net loss is $100, and everyone is made whole by an award of the sum to the firm.\u201d \nId. at 1336. Likewise , the Kimmels did not need to recover separately because \n\u201c[r]ecovery by Mid- State [Fertilizer] would put the Kimmels  in the position they \nwould have occupied had [the Bank] lived up to its promises.\u201d Id.  The Seventh Circuit \nconcluded that the Kimmels , as guarantors , did not have standing to sue. Id.   \nThe same concern arises here: The defendants countersue Energy for allegedly \nbreach ing its obligations under  the Cooperative Agreement  and damaging the \ndefendants\u2019 surety statuses . CCM Answer, at 46 \u201349. They request $23.4 million in \ndamages  because , \u201chad the Project reached financial close, [the defendants] would \nhave been entitled to tens of millions of dollars in fees and compensation for [their] involvement in the development of the Project.\u201d Id.  at 46. If Summit were to    \n \n9 successfully sue Energy for breach  of the Cooperative Agreement , then a portion of \nthe damages that Summit would recover would  presumably  make its way to the \ndefendants , placing them in the position they would have occupied had Energy lived \nup to its promises.  To allow the defendants \u2014rather than Summit \u2014to affirmativel y \nassert these claims  would risk double counting damages , as cautioned by Mid -State \nFertilizer . The parties have not suggested that Summit\u2019s current bankrupt status \naffects this general rule.  \nIn Bank of America, Bank of America and investors of H.F. Holdings, Inc. sued \nH.F. Holdings for breach of contract. 55 Fed. Cl. at 671. The Court of Federal Cl aims \ndetermined that the investors did not have standing to sue the Bank. Id.  at 67 9. The \ncourt  first recognized that the investors had  guaranteed the contract  between Bank \nof America and H.F. Holdings . Id. at 676 \u201377. But the court found that \u201cthe investor s, \nin their dealings with the Bank Board, were not speaking for themselves but rather \nfor their wholly owned corporation,\u201d H.F. Holdings. Id.  at 677. The investors\u2019 \nguarantee of $2.5 million \u201cserved only as a backup to [H.F. Holdings\u2019] own promise to provi de such support.\u201d Id.  The agreement\u2019s language was particularly probative: \u201cThe \nundersigned, constituting the sole stockholders of [H.F. Holdings], jointly and severally, guarantee the obligation of [ H.F. Holdings ] set forth in the third paragraph \nhereof.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court of Federal Claims concluded that \u201cthe record contains no documents \nthat would allow the court to declare that despite the secondary character of their \nobligation, the investors\u2019 participation as guarantors was intended to invest them    \n \n10 with t he status of contract parties.\u201d Id.  at 678. So the court determined that the \ninvestors\u2019 \u201crights and obligations are therefore limited to the scope of their \nguarantee.\u201d Id. The Court of Federal Claims  also explicitly rejected the investors\u2019 \nargument that th ey were  third- party beneficiaries, saying \u201cthe essential contract \ndocument  . . . is bereft of any language demonstrating an intention to confer a benefit \nupon the investors.\u201d Id.  \nThe contracts in this case are similar to those in Bank of America. The \nPayme nt Agreements explicitly say that \u201cPayor is willing to deposit the Credit \nAmount in support of [ Summit ]\u2019s obligations .\u201d E.g., Complaint , Ex. 3, at 1 (emphasis \nadded) . The language in these agreements indicate s that the defendants\u2019 guarantees \nserved only as  backups to Summit\u2019s obligation. And the Cooperative Agreement does \nnot directly benefit the defendants, nor does it show that Energy or Summit intended \nto benefit the defendants.  The defendants\u2019 rights and obligations are limited to the \nscope of the Payment Agreements, which do not give either  defendant the affirmative \nright to sue for breach of the Cooperative  Agreement or other derivative claims.  \nTherefore, the defendants have not shown that they qualify for the exceptional \nprivilege of third -party -beneficiary  status as to the Cooperative Agreement.  \nB. Payment Agreements  \nAlthough the parties are in privity as to the Payment Agreements, the \ndefendants do not have standing to bring t heir counterclaims under these agreements \nbecause the Payment Agreements do not grant the defendants the right to sue Energy \nfor claims relating to the  Cooperative Agreement.  Rather,  if defendants can assert    \n \n11 their claims in any form , they can likely  raise them  as affirmative defense s, as the \ndefendants have already done  in their answers.  \nThe defendants argue  that they have standing to bring their claims  under the \nPayment Agreement s because the defendants and the government are parties to \nthose agreements  and because the defendants\u2019 claim s are rooted in those agreements . \nECF No.  24, at  16\u201317. \u201c[A] contract includes [] not only the promises set forth in \nexpress words, but, in addition, all such implied provisions as are indispensable to \neffectuate the intention of the parties and as arise from the language of the contract \nand the circumstances under which it was made.\u201d Sacramento Nav igation  Co. v. Salz , \n273 U.S. 326, 329 (1927). The Payment Agreements require the defendants to \ndisburse funds if Energy discontinues the project \u201cfor failure to achieve the technical \nobjectives for Phase 1 ,\u201d which are governed  by the Coopera tive Agreement.  E.g., \nComplaint , Ex. 3, at 2 . So, the defendants argue, the Payment Agreements imply that \nEnergy is obligated \u201cto abide by the terms of the Cooperative Agreement, not to \nbreach that agreement, and to act in good faith in any such discontinuation decision ,\u201d \nand the defendants assert that they can sue Energy if it contravenes these \nobligations.  ECF No.  24, at 18. Otherwise, Energy \u201ccould simply breach the \nCooperati[ve] Agreement without merit or in bad faith,\u201d and the defendants would \nhave no recourse. Id.  \nThe government responds that \u201cthe Payment Agreements evidence no \nexpectation by Energy or defendants that the guarantors, CCM and SPG, would be    \n \n12 entitled to damages if Energy breached the underlying Cooperative Agreement.\u201d ECF \nNo. 27, at 9.  \nThe defendants are in privity with the government  as to  the Payment \nAgreements  because th ose agreements  list CCM and SPG as parties . Complaint , \nEx. 6, at 4.  But CCM and SPG do not have standing to assert affirmative \ncounterclaims under the Cooperative Agreement  just because they are parties to the \nPayment Agreements . The Payment Agreements set forth  limited rights for Energy \u2014\nto receive collateral if Energy or Summit terminate or discontinue the Cooperative \nAgreement \u2014and limited rights for th e defendants \u2014to exercise voting power \npertaining to the collateral and to withdraw specified interest that the collateral accrues. E.g., Complaint , Ex. 3, at 2\u2013 4. The Payment Agreements do not explicitly or \nimplicitly grant the defendants the right to sue  the government i f Energy were to \nbreach  the Cooperative Agreement,  which is  an entirely separate contract  to which \nthe defendants are not parties . Therefore, the defendants do not have standing under \nthe Payment Agreements to bring their counterclaims.  \nThis does not mean that the defendants are  without recourse if the government \nhas breached the Cooperative Agreement.  Though the defendants \u201cmay not use that \nagreement as a basis to seek counterclaim damages,\u201d they might, as the government \nrecognizes, \u201cbe ent itled to assert any contractual defenses that were available to \nSummit under the Cooperative Agreement .\u201d ECF No.  20, at 14.  And the defendants \nhave done exactly that, raising their breach of contract, breach of the implied duty of    \n \n13 good faith and fair dealing , and impairment of surety claims as affirmative defenses. \nCCM Answer, at 28\u2013 29. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nBecause the defendants do not have standing to bring their counterclaims, I \ngrant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss  for lack of standing . I do not address the \nparties\u2019 other arguments regarding  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6).     \n \n14  IN THE UNITED STATES  DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA , \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n   v. \n CCM TCEP, LLC, and  \nSUMMIT POWER GROUP, LLC,  \n \n   Defendant s. ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n)  \n   C.A.
