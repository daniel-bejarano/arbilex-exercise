No. 21-1142-LPS\n\nDELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF\nCORRECTION, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nMichael D. Simmons, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nRA \\ [| \u2014\nST. U.S. Circuit Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Michael D. Simmons, an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in\nWilmington, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 3) Plaintiff appears pro\nse and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 12) He has filed numerous motions.\n(D.I. 5-11) The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and\n1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff alleges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, his right to equal\nprotection, and that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, excessive use of force, and\nbodily injury and sexual assault, beginning in February 2020 and continuing as of the date he filed\nthis action in early August 2021. When Plaintiff commenced this action, the grievance process was\nnot complete. (D.I. 3 at 8)\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from\nsuch relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (\u00e9n forma\npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally\n\n1\nconstrued and the Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Neztrke v. Willams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also\nGrayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or\ndelusional\u201d factual scenario. Dooley \u00bbv. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a\nplaintiff leave to amend, unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson, 293 F.3d at\n114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pled allegations in the complaint as\ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes that those\nallegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Be// Atl, Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more than\nsimply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of\naction.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a\n\n2\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Asheroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a\nplaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v.\nCity of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the\nlegal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Igbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency\nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pled factual allegations, the court should assume\ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See\nConnelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task\nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, a prisoner must pursue all available\navenues for relief through the prison\u2019s grievance system before bringing a federal civil rights action.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 n.6 (2001) (\u201c[A]n inmate must exhaust\nirrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u201d). Section\n1997(e) provides that \u201c[n]Jo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section\n1983 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in\nany jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are\nexhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e). The exhaustion requirement is mandatory. See Wiliams v. Beard,\n\n3\n482 F.3d 637, 639 (3d Cir. 2007); Booth, 532 U.S. at 742 (holding that exhaustion requirement of\nPLRA applies to grievance procedures, \u201cregardless of the relief offered through administrative\nprocedures\u201d). The limitations period for filing a \u00a7 1983 action is tolled during the period that a\nprisoner spends exhausting his administrative remedies. See Jones \u00bb. Unknown D.O.C. Bus Driver C\nTransportation Crew, 944 F.3d 478, 480 (3d Cir. 2019).\n\nThere is no futility exception to \u00a7 1997e\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See Nyhuis \u00bb. Reno, 204\nF.3d 65, 75-76 (3d Cir. 2000). An inmate must fully satisfy the administrative requirements of the\ninmate grievance process before proceeding into federal court. See Spruill v, Gillis, 372 F.3d 218 (3d\nCir. 2004); see also Oriakhi v. United States, 165 F. App\u2019x 991, 993 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[T]here appears to\nbe unanimous circuit court consensus that a prisoner may not fulfill the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion\nrequirement by exhausting administrative remedies after the filing of the complaint in federal\ncourt\u201d). Courts have concluded that inmates who fail to fully, or timely, complete the prison\ngrievance process are barred from subsequently litigating claims in federal court. Sve e.g., Booth \u00bb.\nChurner, 206 F.3d 289 (3d Cir. 2000); Bolla v. Strickland, 304 F. App\u2019x 22 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nIf the actions of prison officials directly caused the inmate\u2019s procedural default on a\ngtievance, the inmate will not be held to strict compliance with this exhaustion requirement. See\nCamp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279 (3d Cir. 2000). In addition, an inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust will be\nexcused \u201cunder certain limited circumstances,\u201d Harris v. Armstrong, 149 F. App\u2019x 58, 59 (3d Cir.\n2005), and an inmate can defeat a claim of failure to exhaust by showing \u201che was misled or that\nthere was some extraordinary reason he was prevented from complying with the statutory mandate.\u201d\nDavis v. Warman, 49 F. App\u2019x 365, 368 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Ross \u00bb Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 642-44\n(2016) (stating administrative procedure is not available when it operates as simple dead end; when it\nis so opaque that it becomes incapable of use; and when prison administrators thwart inmates from\n\n4\ntaking advantage of grievance process through machination, misinterpretation, or intimidation).\nAlso, \u201cadministrative remedies are not \u2018available\u2019 under the PLRA where a prison official inhibits an\ninmate from resorting to them through serious threats of retaliation and bodily harm.\u201d Rinaldi \u00bb.\nUnited States, 904 F.3d 257, 267 (3d Cir. 2018).\n\nWhile exhaustion is an affirmative defense, the Court may sua sponte dismiss an action\npursuant to \u00a7 1915A when the failure to exhaust defense is obvious from the face of the complaint.\nSee Caiby v. Haidle, 785 F. App\u2019x 64, 65 (3d Cir. 2019). Plaintiff admits that the grievance process\nwas not complete when he filed his Complaint. (D.I. 3 at 8) He states that he \u201cimmediately filed\nthis complaint due to the physical injuries and while the assault was fresh in his mind. DOC has\nalready attempted to downplay the attack and conventional wisdom says DOC will deny his\ngrievance.\u201d (Id) Given Plaintiffs admission in the Complaint that the grievance process was not\ncomplete when he filed this action, dismissal for failure to exhaust is warranted. The Complaint will\nbe dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss the Complaint without prejudice, pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1), for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; and\n(2) deny Plaintiff's motions (D.I. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nMICHAEL E. SIMMONS,\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civ. No. 21-1142-LPS\n\nDELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF\nCORRECTION, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this 28th day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. Plaintiff's motions are DENIED. (D.I. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n\n2: The Complaint is DISMISSED without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(1) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required under\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n\nke The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n"}
