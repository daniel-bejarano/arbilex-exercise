Pending before the Court is \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.  (D.I. 44.)   For the reasons announced from the bench on February \n4, 2022, I recommend that Defendants\u2019 motion be GRANTED -IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART . \nI. DISCUSS ION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench on February 4, 2022 as \nfollows:  \nThis is my report and recommendation on the pending \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in Juan Doe v. Delaware State University Board of Trustees .  \n  I will summarize the reasons for my recommendation in a \nmoment.  But before I do, I want to be clear that while we will not be issuing a separate written recommendation, we have followed a full process for making the recommendation that I  am about to state. \n  2 \n I have carefully considered the parties \u2019 briefing on the \nmotion,1 and I heard oral argument today.2  At the oral argument, \nPlaintiff \u2019s counsel made a number of new arguments and referred to \na number of cases not previously presented to t he Court.  Those \narguments and cases were not considered to the extent that they raise \nissues not presented in the briefing.  \n  For the following reasons, I recommend that Defendants \u2019 \nmotion to dismiss be GRANTED -IN-PART and DENIED- IN-\nPART . \n  Plaintiff file d his original C omplaint on November 20, \n2020.\n3  It contained ten counts and named as defendants the \nDelaware State University Board of Trustees and Candy Young, in her individual capacity.\n4   \n  On November 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion for a \ntempor ary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.\n5  Judge \nNoreika denied that motion on May 21, 2021.6  In the meantime, on \nMarch 3, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff \u2019s \noriginal Complaint for failure to state a claim.7  On June 10, 2021, \nthis case, including the pending motion to dismiss, was referred to me.\n8   \n  After reviewing the parties \u2019 briefing on the motion to \ndismiss, it appeared to me that the parties were talking past each other regarding which entities could be appropriately named as defendants for certain of Plaintiff \u2019s claims.  I ordered the parties to \n\u201cmeet and confer to discuss  (1) Defendants \u2019 position that the \nDelaware State University Board of Trustees is an inappropriate defendant for Plaintiff \u2019s claims that DSU violated Title IX and Title \n \n1 (D.I. 25; D.I.  26; D.I.  28; D.I.  43; D.I.  44; D.I.  45.)   \n \n2 (Tr. _.)  \n \n3 (D.I. 1.)  \n  \n4 (Id.) \n \n5 (D.I. 6.)   \n \n6 (D.I. 29.)  \n \n7 (D.I. 24.)  \n  \n8 (D.I. 30.)  3 \n VI and breached its contract with Plaintiff and (2) the parties \u2019 \nrespective positions on which entity is appropriately named as a \ndefendant to those claims.\u201d9   \n  I received a joint letter from the parties on January 11, 2022,  \nreporting that they had come to an agreement that the Board of Trustees was not an appropriate defendant for some of the counts.\n10 \nI held a status teleconference on January 13, 2022 to discuss the most appropriate and efficient way to proceed with the cas e and the \npending motion to dismiss in light of the fact that the C omplaint \nneeded to be amended.\n11   \n  On January 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, \nwhich, among other things, added Delaware State University as a defendant.\n12  That same day, I dismissed as moot the motion to \ndismiss the original C omplaint.13  On January 21, Defendants filed \na motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint.14  The same day, the \nparties submitted a stipulation agreeing that they would rely on the briefing on the prior motion to dismiss.\n15   \n  For purposes of analyzing the Amended C omplaint under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) I assume that the following alleged facts are true.  \n \nDSU has a policy titled \u201cPolicy and Procedures: Equal \nOpportunity, Harassment and N ondiscrimination\u201d (the \u201cPolicy\u201d).\n16  \nThe Policy is an exhibit to the Amended Complaint.  Among other things, the Policy states that DSU \u201c will not discriminate against any \n. . . student . . . on the basis of race, . . . sex, . . . ethnicity, national \n \n9 (D.I. 33.)   \n \n10 (D.I. 36.)  \n \n11 (D.I. 37;

To avoid confusion, the complainant (referred to in the Amended \nComplaint as \u201c Jane Doe \u201d) will be referred to as \u201cJane, \u201d and Plaintiff Juan Doe will be referred to \nas \u201cPlaintiff. \u201d   \n \n41 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 34 \u201335.)   \n \n42 (Id. \u00b6 38; D.I. 39 -5 (Ex. 4) .) \n   \n43 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 36 \u201340.)  \n \n44 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 50\u201351.)  \n  \n45 (Id. \u00b6 55.)   \n  \n46 (Id.) \n \n47 (Id. \u00b6 58.)   \n 8 \n to cross -examine Jane at the hearing because she was not in \nattendance.48  \n  \nThe ERP found that Plaintiff had engaged in sexual \nmisconduct and suspended him from DSU for one year.49  The ERP \ndid not consider Plaintiff \u2019s allegations against Jane at that time.50  \nPlaintiff appealed the ERP \u2019s decision.51  Plaintiff \u2019s appeal was \ndenied on December 19, 2019.52   \n Plaintiff \u2019s Amended Complaint has nine counts, alleging \nfederal and state law claims. Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.  \n I\u2019m not going to read into the record the  standard that applies \nto assessing motions to dismiss under Federal Rule 12(b)(6).  I have a standard that I use in my opinions, for example, in Truinject Corp. v. Nestle Skin Health, S.H., 2020 WL 70981, which I incorporate by reference.\n53 \n \n \n48 (Id. \u00b6 59.)  \n \n49 (Id. \u00b6 65.)   \n \n50 (Id.) \n \n51 (Id. \u00b6 68.)  \n  \n52 (Id. \u00b6 77 ; D.I. 39 -12 (Ex. 11) .) \n \n53 Truinject Corp. v. Nestle Skin Health, S.A., No. 19- 592-LPS-JLH, 2020 WL 70981, at \n*7 (D. Del. Jan. 7, 2020) .  A defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \nmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as  true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible \non its face.\u2019\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) ).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201cfactual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of rel ief is not enough.  \nId.  \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \n\u2018stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Id.  (quoting \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint under the plausibility standard, all \u201cwell -\npleaded facts\u201d are assumed to be true, but legal conclusions are not.  Id.  at 679.  \u201c[W]hen the \nallegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of enti tlement to relief, this basic \ndeficiency should be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (internal marks omitted).  9 \n [Title IX and  VI Claims (Counts 1\u20133)]  \nCounts 1, 2, and 3 of the Amended Complaint are claims \nunder Title IX and Title VI against DSU.  \n  \nTitle IX provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United States shall, \non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]\u201d\n54   \n  \nCounts 1 and 2 set forth different theories underlying \nPlaintiff \u2019s claim that DSU violated Title IX, but the Third Circuit \nhas declined to adopt particular doctrinal tests and instead has \nadopted a straightforward pleading standard for Title IX \nviolations.55  To state a claim under Title IX in the Third Circuit, the \nalleged facts must support a plausible inference that the school \ndiscriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of sex.56   \n  \nTitle VI provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United States shall, \non the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.\u201d57  In order to state a claim for race or national \norigin discrimination pursuant to Title VI , the alleged facts must \nsupport a plausible inference that the school purposely discriminated \nagainst the plaintiff on the basis of race.58    \n  DSU argues that the Amended Complaint fails to plausibly \nallege that DSU discriminated against Plaintiff on th e basis of his \nsex or race/national origin.  Plaintiff \u2019s Answering B rief is hardly a \nmodel of clarity, but I agree that Counts 1, 2, and 3 state claims \nunder Title IX and Title VI.   The Amended Complaint alleges facts \nplausibly suggesting that DSU was impr operly motivated by sex \nand/or race/national origin because it investigated Plaintiff for sexual misconduct but chose not to investigate Jane, a female \n \n54 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a ). \n \n55 Doe v.

Apr. \n16, 2015). 10 \n student of a different race/national origin, who also allegedly \nviolated the Policy.   \n The Policy prohi bits non- consensual sexual intercourse.  It \nstates that a person cannot consent if he or she is rendered disoriented or helpless from alcohol, and the other person cannot use as an excuse that they were themselves intoxicated.  The Amended Complaint allege s, among other things, that Plaintiff told DSU \u2019s \nTitle IX Coordinator that Jane sexually assaulted him while he was drunk.  It further alleges that DSU \u2019s Title IX Coordinator failed to \ninvestigate Plaintiff \u2019s allegation.  It also alleges that Plaintiff \nprovided evidence of text messages favorable to Plaintiff but that \nthe Title IX Coordinator failed to include them in the investigative file. And it alleges that, although Plaintiff identified witnesses to support his version of the events, the investigative file compiled by \nthe Title IX Coordinator did not contain any statements from those witnesses, notwithstanding the Policy\u2019 s promise that all \ninvestigations will entail interviews with all relevant witnesses.   \n  When those and the other alleged facts are t aken as true and \nviewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, one plausible explanation is that DSU enforced the Policy against Plaintiff and not against Jane because of sex and/or race/national origin bias.\n59 \n \nDSU argues that the Amended Complaint contains nothing \nmore than allegations concerning a procedurally flawed disciplinary proceeding. I agree with DSU that a procedurally flawed \ninvestigation alone cannot support a Title IX claim, but the \nAmended Complaint alleges more than that.  It alleges tha t Plaintiff, \na Latino male of Mexican origin, and Jane, a Black female, brought similar allegations of sexual misconduct to DSU but that DSU did \n \n59 See Univ. of Scis., 961 F.3d at 210\u201311 (reversing district court\u2019s dismissal of Title IX \nclaim where male plaintiff alleged that the university (1) \u201cinvestigated him but chose not to \ninvestigate three female students who allegedly violated the [sexual misconduct] Policy\u201d and (2) charged the pl aintiff because his accuser was intoxicated when they had sex, but failed to consider \nwhether the accuser should have been charged due to the plaintiff\u2019s intoxication); Schwake v. Arizona Bd. of Regents , 967 F.3d 940, 951 (9th Cir. 2020); Abraham v. Thomas  Jefferson Univ. , \nNo. 20- 2967, 2021 WL 4132566, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 10, 2021) ( denying motion to dismiss where \nthe male  plaintiff  alleged, among other things, tha t the university completely failed  to investigate \nthe plaintiff\u2019s report against his female colleague, but considered that same colleague\u2019s allegations \nagainst him); Doe v. Amherst Coll. , 238 F. Supp. 3d 195, 223 (D. Mass. 2017) (finding allegations \nsufficient to support Title IX claim where college encouraged a female student to file a formal complaint but did not encourage the plaintiff to file a formal complaint or investigate his allegations even though he alleged the same conduct as the female student).  11 \n not investigate Plaintiff \u2019s complaint, and either did not investigate \nor did not include in the investigative f ile evidence favorable to \nPlaintiff.  That suggests more than a procedurally flawed \ninvestigation; it suggests that DSU may have treated similarly situated individuals differently.  Whether Plaintiff will ultimately be able to prove that, I don \u2019t know, but  he states a claim.  \n DSU also contends that Plaintiff \u2019s factual allegations are not \nplausible because Plaintiff \u2019s story about the events in question has \nchanged.  Having thoroughly reviewed the allegations and documents attached to the Amended Complaint, I  can\u2019t disagree \nwith DSU that the documents attached as exhibits are not entirely supportive of Plaintiff \u2019s allegation that he told the Title IX \ncoordinator and the ERP panel that he was assaulted at the time they were investigating and assessing Jane\u2019s complaint of sexual assault.   Indeed, one inference that might be drawn from the exhibits is that Plaintiff didn\u2019t do that and that his story changed over time.  But it is not the role of the Court at this stage of the proceedings  to weigh \nthe evidence and choose between inferences.\n60  \n If the Amended Complaint contains false allegations of fact, \nthe Court will deal with that in an appropriate way at the appropriate time.   But it is not self -evident from the Amended Complaint and \nthe attached exhibits that Plaintiff\u2019s allegations are false.  They are \nwhat they are and, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Amended Complaint states claims under Title IX and Title VI.  \n Accordingly, I recommend that the Court deny the motion to \ndismiss with respect to Counts 1, 2, and 3. \n \n[\u00a7 1981 Claim (Count 4) ] \n \nCount 4 is a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against Defendant \nDSU and Defendant Young. \n Section 1981 provides that \u201c[a]ll  persons within the \njurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every \n \n60 See Doe v. Miami Univ., 882 F.3d 579, 594 (6th Ci r. 2018) ( \u201cAt the pleading stage, \nJohn\u2019 s allegations need only create the plausible inference of intentional gender discrimination; \nalthough alternative non- discriminatory explanations for the defendants \u2019 behavior may exist, that \npossibility does not bar J ohn\u2019s access to discovery. \u201d).  The Roe v. University of Cincinnati  case \ncited by Defendants is inapposite because that court was ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction.  No. 18- 312, 2018 WL 9944938, at *7 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 21, 2018).   \n 12 \n State and Territory to make and enforce contracts.\u201d61  However, \nthere is no private right of action under \u00a7 1981 against a state actor.62   \n  \nPlaintiff agreed during t he oral argument today that his \n\u00a7 1981 claim against DSU may be dismissed.  Moreover, Plaintiff \u2019s \nanswering brief acknowledges that Defendant Young is a state \nactor.63  Count 4 should therefore be dismissed.  \n \n[\u00a7 1983 ( Equal Protection ) Claim (Count 5) ] \n \nCount 5 is a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that \nDefendant  Board of Trustees and Defendant Young violated the \nEqual Protection Clause by discriminating against Plaintiff on the \nbasis of sex and/or race/national origin. \n A plaintiff can plead a violation of \u00a7 1983 for a denial of \nequal protection by plausibly alleging that a person acting under color of state law subjected the plaintiff to different treatment than others similarly situated.\n64  \n For the same reasons as discussed abo ve with respect to the \nTitle IX and Title VI claims, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Young treated him differently than Jane, who was similarly situated, on the basis of sex and race/national origin.   \n Defendant Young argues that the claim against he r in her \nindividual capacity should be dismissed because she has qualified immunity.  At the motion to dismiss stage, a government actor is shielded by qualified immunity if (1) the facts alleged show the actor \u2019s conduct did not violate a constitutional ri ght, or (2) the right \nviolated was not clearly established in light of the specific context of the case.\n65  A right is \u201cclearly established\u201d for qualified immunity \npurposes only if \u201c[t]he contours of the right\u201d are \u201csufficiently clear \n \n61 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.   \n \n62 DeMoss v. Del . State Univ., No. 16- 680-MN, 2018 WL 4955231, at *4\u20135 (D. Del. Oct. \n12, 2018) (citing Ford v. Se . Pa. Transp. Auth., 374 F. App\u2019 x 325, 326 (3d Cir. 2010)); see also \nMcGovern v. City of Philadelphia, 554 F.3d 114, 120\u201321 (3d Cir. 2009).   \n \n63 (See D.I. 26 at 5.)  \n \n64 See Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d 247, 273 (3d Cir. 2014).   \n \n65 Taylor v.

On the other hand, there is no requirement of a  prior [court decision]  \nprecisely on point.  In this case, Plaintiff contends that Young purposely treated him differently than Jane on the basis of Plaintiff \u2019s \nsex and race/national origin.  It cannot be seriously disputed that, at the time of Defendant Y oung\u2019 s alleged conduct, the law was \nsufficiently clear that, in the public education context, students have an equal protection right to be free from purposeful discrimination and selective enforcement of school policies based on their sex and race/national origin.  Indeed, well prior to the events of this case, the \nEqual Protection Clause was interpreted to prohibit any purposeful discrimination directed at an individual by state actors solely because of the individual \u2019s membership in a protected class.\n67  \n That is what the Amended Complaint alleges.  Only time \nwill tell whether Plaintiff can prove it.  Defendant Young is free to \nreraise her qualified immunity arguments at the summary judgment \nstage, when the record is further developed.  In the me antime, Count \n5 should proceed as to Defendant Young.   \n \nCount 5 also names the Board of Trustees.  Plaintiff agreed \nduring the oral argument today that his \u00a7 1983 claim against the \nBoard of Trustees may be dismissed.  \n \n[Contract Claim (Count 6) ] \n \n Count 6 is a breach of contract claim against DSU.  It alleges \nthat DSU breached its Policy.  \n  \nTo state a claim for breach of contract under Delaware law, \nthe plaintiff must allege the following: first, the existence of the \ncontract, whether express or implied; second, the breach of an \n \n66 Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).  \n \n67 See Miami Univ. , 882 F.3d at  604; see also Oona R.- S.- by Kate S. v. McCaffrey , 143 \nF.3d 473, 476 (9th Cir. 1998) ( \u201c[T]he right to be free from intentional gender discrimination by a \nstate actor was clearly established as early as 1988. \u201d). \n 14 \n obligation imposed by that contract; and third, the resultant damage \nto the plaintiff.68  \n DSU\u2019s briefing points out [in a footnote] that \u201cit is unsettled  \nunder Delaware law whether a student conduct policy at DSU, a public univers ity, could constitute a binding contract with its \nstudents.\u201d\n69  [To the extent DSU contends that its student conduct \npolicy cannot as a matter of law  constitute a binding contract , that \nargument ] was not squarely raised; regardless, I recommend \nrejecting it at this stage of the case.  As another judge sitting in this district recently acknowledged, \u201c In Delaware, \u2018 [t]he relationship \nbetween a student and the university he attends is one of \ncontract. \u2019\u201d\n70  Moreover, \u201c[T]o find the terms of an education \ncontract, Delaware courts have looked to documents like the \nschool \u2019s course catalog or student handbook.\u201d71 \n DSU next contends  that the Amended Complaint fails to \nadequately identify a specific term or provision of the contract that is alleged to have been breached.   I conclude that the Amended \nComplaint plausibly alleges that DSU breached the Policy.  As one \nexample, the Policy states that DSU will not discriminate against \nstudents on the basis of race, sex, or national origin.  Plaintiff has \nplausibly alleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of his race/national origin and sex.  Accordingly, Count 6 should \nproceed against DSU.  \n \n[Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress  Claim  (Count 7) ] \n  Count 7 is a state law negligent infliction of emotional \ndistress claim against DSU.  \n \n\u201cThere are three elements to the claim of negligent infliction \nof emotional distress [ ]: (1) negligence causing fright to someone; \n \n68 Greenstar, LLC v. Heller , 814 F. Supp. 2d 444, 450 (D. Del. 2011); VLIW Tech., LLC v. \nHewlett -Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003). \n \n69 (D.I. 25 at 15, n.9 (emphasis added) .) \n \n70 Ninivaggi v. Univ. of Del ., No. 20- 1478- SB, 2021 WL 3709765, at *2 (D. Del. Aug. 20, \n2021) (quoting Siebold v. Univ. of Del ., No. 4399, 1975 WL 4178, at *3 (Del. Ch. Mar. 12, 1975)).  \n \n71 Id. (citing Virgili v. Wesley Coll., Inc., No. 711- K, 1981 WL 88268, at *2 (Del. Ch. Mar. \n23, 1981) ); Swanson v. Wesley Coll., Inc., 402 A.2d 401, 403 (Del . Super. Ct. 1979) . \n 15 \n (2) that the plaintiff was within the \u2018 zone of danger \u2019; and (3) that the \nplaintiff suffered physical harm as a result.\u201d72   \n \nThis claim should be dismissed for multiple reasons, not the \nleast of which is that the Amended Complaint fails to plead facts plausibly suggesting that DSU breached a tort duty in a way that caused a fright to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff \u2019s brief devotes one paragraph \nto this claim, but Plaintiff cites no case law and does not even attempt to explain how the allegations in the Amended Complaint plausibly suggest that the elements of the claim might be met.    Count 7 should be dismissed.  [Negligent Hiring Claim  (Count 8) ] \n  Count 8 alleges a negligent hiring claim against DSU.  \nPlaintiff says that DSU acted negligently when it hired and retained its police force, its Title IX Coordinator, and the members of the ERP.  \n \nAn employer may be liable for negligent hiring/retention \nwhere it was foreseeable that an employee would engage in tortious behavior.  This claim should also be dismissed for multiple reasons.   \nFor one thing, the Amended Complaint fails to plausibly allege that any of the alleged wrongful conduct on the part of DSU employees was foreseeable to DSU.    \n Moreover, the Amended Complaint alleges that the \nwrongful conduct committed by DSU employees was  breach of \ncontract and violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.   Plaintiff \u2019s \nclaim s (if any) that DSU  employees breached DSU \u2019s contract with \nPlaintiff lie in contract, not in a tort claim for negligent hiring.\n73  \nLikewise, Plaintiff \u2019s claims that DSU employees violated federal \nanti-discrimination laws do not give rise to a negligent hiring \nclaim.74  Plaintiff cites no case law suggesting otherwise.   \n \n72 Spence v. Cherian, 135 A.3d 1282, 1289\u201390 (Del. Super. Ct. 2016) (quoting Armstrong \nv. A.I. duP ont Hosp. for Child., 60 A.3d 414, 423 (Del. Super. Ct. 2012)).   \n \n73 \u201cAs a general rule under Delaware law, where an action is based entirely on a breach of \nthe terms of a  contract  between the parties, and not on a violation of an independent  duty imposed \nby law, a plaintiff must sue in contract  and not in tort.\u201d  Pinkert v. Olivieri, No. 99- 380-SLR, 2001 \nWL 641737, at *5 (D. Del. May 24, 2001).  \n \n74 Williams v. P a. State  Univ. , No. 20- 298, 2020 WL 5291985, at *9 (M .D. Pa. Sept. 4, \n2020) (rejecting plaintiff\u2019s argument that \u201ca violation of Title IX\u2019s standards constitutes a violation of a duty for negligence purposes\u201d  and, accordingly, dismissing negligent hiring/training claims ).  \n 16 \n  \nAt oral argument today, Plaintiff suggested for the first time \nthat the underlying tortious conduct committed by the DSU employees was actually their negligent infliction of emotional distress.  Not only is that a new theory not raised in the briefing, \nthat\u2019s not what is pleaded in the A mended C omplaint.  Regardless I \nreject that argument for the same reason I reject the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim.  \n Count 8 should be dismissed.  \n[Premises Liability Claim (Count 9) ] \n \nFinally, Count 9 alleges a premises liability claim against \nDSU.  Plaintiff \u2019s claim is based on his allegation that Jane sexually \nassaulted Plaintiff on DSU \u2019s campus.  \n Under Delaware law, a unive rsity may be liable to its \nstudents for injuries caused by the criminal acts of third persons if the acts were foreseeable and subject to university control.\n75   \n \nBut the Amended Complaint does not plausibly suggest that \nDSU\u2019 s negligence in maintaining or monitoring its premises or in \ncontrolling its students contributed to the alleged assault of Plaintiff.  Nor does the Amended Complaint suggest that DSU had any reason \nto suspect that Jane in particular would commit a sexual assault.  \n \nPlaintiff appears to contend that the mere foreseeability that \nsexual assaults will occur on a university campus is, without more, \nenough to give rise to negligence liability.  Plaintiff \u2019s briefing cited \nno case law from Delaware or any other jur isdiction to support that \nproposition, and I recommend that it be rejected.\n76 \n \nAt oral argument this morning, Plaintiff cited for the first \ntime the Third Circuit\u2019 s recent opinion in Hall v. Millersville \nUniversity .77  I reviewed that case during the reces s.  It is inapposite \nand doesn\u2019 t inform the Court \u2019s consideration of Plaintiff \u2019s state law \npremises liability claim.  \n \n75 Furek v. Univ. of Del ., 594 A.2d 506, 521 (Del. 1991). \n   \n76 See Hernandez v. Baylor Univ., 274 F. Supp. 3d 602, 619 (W.D. Tex. 2017) ( \u201cCourts \nacross the country have determined . . . that the general foreseeability of sexual assault on campus \nis insufficient to warrant negligence liability. \u201d). \n \n77 22 F.4th 397 (3d Cir. 2022)  17 \n  \nI recommend that the Court dismiss Count 9.  \n \n \nII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Defendant s\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 44) \nbe GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART  as follows:  \n1.  The motion to dismiss should be DENIED with respect to Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6.  The \nmotion should also be DENI ED with respect to Count 5 as to Defendant Young. \n2.  The motion to dismiss should be GRANTED with respect to Counts 4, 7, 8, and 9.  The \nmotion should also be GRANTED with respect to Count 5 as to Defendant Board of Trustees.   \nThose claims should be dismissed with out prejudice.  I further recommend that Plaintiff be granted \nleave to amend to address the identified deficiencies within 14 days. \n This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B),(C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and l imited to \nten pages.   Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten \npages.
