Counsel for\nDefendants\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\na\nFebruary (4 , 2023\nWilmington, Delaware\ndudiuy\u2014\ndudes dG ud Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Marcus J. Johnson appears pro se and proceeds in forma pauperis.\n(D.I. 1). On June 24, 2021, he filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.! (D.I. 2).\nBefore the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. (D.I. 20). Plaintiff has filed a\nresponse in opposition. (D.!. 22).\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff's allegations took place in May 2020, during which time he was\nincarcerated at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (\u201cJTVCC\u201d) in Smyrna,\nDelaware. He named as defendants Centurion of Delaware, LLC, which was the\nhealth service provider for JTVCC, and Matthew Wofford, who was employed by\nCenturion as the health service administrator at JTVCC.\n\n| take the factual allegations of the Complaint as true and construe them in the\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff. In June 2019, Plaintiff was diagnosed with keratoconus\n\n. and \u201cprimary open-angle glaucoma, bilateral.\u201d (D.1. 2 at 5). He was prescribed\n\nlatanoprost by an \u201ceye doctor,\u201d to be used nightly before going to sleep. (/d.). On May\n1, 2020, Plaintiff requested a refill of latanoprost. (/d.). The policy and practice of the\nmedical department was to refill medication prescriptions within seventy-two hours.\n(/d.). Plaintiff used his last daily dose of latanoprost on May 8, 2020, but he did not\nreceive his refill until June 1, 2020. (/d.). During the approximately three weeks in\nwhich he did not have latanoprost, he suffered from severe pain in both eyes, daily\ndizziness, loss of acuity within his eyes, and mental anguish. (/d. at 7). Plaintiff filed a\n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived\n\nhim of a federal right, and the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of\nstate law. West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\n{\ngrievance, which was upheld by the medical department bureau chief, who agreed that\n\u201cpatient should be given his eye drops refill in a timely manner. Medical to make every\neffort to provide timely refills to patient.\u201d (/d. at 5). This incident represented the fourth\ntime there was a delay in providing Plaintiff with a latanoprost refill. (/d.). For relief,\nPlaintiff seeks $100,000 in damages. (/d. at 7). He also, without elaboration, requests\nappointed counsel. (/d.).?\n\nOn February 25, 2022, | screened and reviewed the Complaint and allowed\nPlaintiff to proceed on his claims. (D.1. 16). On April 12, 2022, Defendants filed a\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure. (D.I. 20). Plaintiff opposes the motion to dismiss. (D.I. 22).\nil. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), | must accept all\nfactual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds\npro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded,\nmust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d /d.\nat 94. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the\ncomplainant, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\n\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\n2 Plaintiff's request for appointed counsel will be denied without prejudice to renew,\n\ngiven that he has not addressed any of the relevant factors that must be considered in\n\nassessing such a request. See Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 155-56 (3d Cir. 1993).\n2\n\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of\na cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). | am \u201cnot required to credit bald assertions or\nlegal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.\u201d /n re Rockefeller Ctr. Props.,\nInc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed,\nhowever, \u201cfor imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014) (per curiam).\n\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \u201csubstantive\nplausibility.\u201d /d. at 12. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint.\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the\n[complainant] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\ninference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d /d. Deciding\nwhether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing\ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d. at 679.\n\nlll. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff claims that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs.\nThe Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment requires that\nprison officials provide inmates with adequate medical care. Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 103-05 (1976). In order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege\n(i) a serious medical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate\ndeliberate indifference to that need. /d. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197\n(3d Cir. 1999). A prison official is deliberately indifferent if he or she knows that a\n\n3\nprisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to\navoid the harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).\n\nAlthough Plaintiff was allowed to proceed on his deliberate indifference claims\nfollowing screening (D.1. 16), | now have the benefit of adversarial briefing, and | now\nconclude that the facts alleged in the Complaint fail to state an actionable constitutional\nclaim against either Defendant.\n\nCorporations such as Centurion that contract with government entities to provide prison\nmedical services cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 based on theories of respondeat\nsuperior or vicarious liability. See Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575,\n583 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978)); see\nalso Miller v. Corr. Med. Sys., Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1126, 1131-32 (D. Del. 1992).\n\nInstead, a corporation\u2019s liability for constitutional violations under \u00a7 1983 may be\nestablished only if the plaintiff provides evidence of a \u201crelevant [] policy or custom, and\nthat the policy caused the constitutional violation they allege.\u201d Natale, 318 F.3d at 584;\nsee also Price v. Kozak, 569 F. Supp. 2d 398, 413 (D. Del. 2008).\n\n\u201cTo satisfy the pleading standard, [Plaintiff] must identify [the] custom or policy,\nand specify what exactly that custom or policy was.\u201d McTernan v. City of York, 564\nF.3d 636, 658 (3d Cir. 2009). Plaintiff fails to meet this requirement. To the contrary,\nPlaintiff identifies the existence of a Centurion policy and practice that would have\nprevented his injuries (prescriptions are to be filled within seventy-two hours), but he\nalleges that unidentified individuals failed to follow the policy (in May 2020 and on three\nother occasions that are not the immediate subject of this action). Plaintiff underlines\nthis point by alleging that the medical department bureau chief, in upholding Plaintiff's\n\n4\ngrievance, reiterated that he should be timely given his refills, and that \u201cevery effort\u201d will\nbe made to ensure that they are timely refilled. (D.I.2 at 5). Accordingly, given the\nabsence of allegations of an unconstitutional Centurion policy.or practice, | conclude\nthat Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Centurion.\n\nAs to Defendant Wofford, liability in a civil rights action cannot be based on\nrespondeat superior alone and defendants in such actions must be alleged to have had\npersonal involvement in the wrongs complained of. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845\nF.2d 1195, 1207-08 (3d Cir. 1988). \u201cPersonal involvement can be shown through\nallegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence.\u201d /d. at\n1208. Most of Plaintiffs allegations against Wofford are purely based on his\nsupervisory role, which allegedly made him \u201cwell aware of the various delays within the\nmedical dept. and years of it.\u201d (D.l. 2 at 6). The Third Circuit has explained that\n\u201c[plersonal involvement must be alleged and is only present where the supervisor\ndirected the actions of supervisees or actually knew of the actions and acquiesced in\nthem.\" Jetter v. Beard, 130 F. App\u2019x 523, 526 (citing Rode, 845 F.2d at 1207). In\nJetter, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of allegations that officials violated a\nplaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights because they allegedly \"knew or should reasonably\nhave known\" that the prison doctor's actions would cause unnecessary pain and further\ninjury. /d. at 525. Such is the tenor of Plaintiffs allegations against Wofford here,\nwhich are accordingly subject to dismissal. Although Plaintiff additionally alleges that\nWofford \u201cis/was strategically causing the plaintiff mental/physical harm,\u201d (D.I. 2 at 6),\nthis conclusory assertion is lacking in any factual support pleaded with particularity, and\nthus is not enough to save his claim against Wofford.\n\n5\n\nSince it is plausible that Plaintiff may be able to articulate a deliberate\nindifference claim, | will dismiss the Complaint without prejudice.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, | will grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and deny Plaintiff's request for appointed counsel. Plaintiff will\nbe given leave to file an amended complaint.\n\nA separate order shall issue.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nMARCUS J.
