Mattison (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019) commenced this action on October 8,\n2021. (D.I.2) She appears pro se and was denied leave to proceed in forma\npauperis on October 14, 2021. (D.I.4) On October 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a\nletter/motion for reconsideration. (D.I. 6)\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff \u201cappeals\u201d the order denying her leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n(D.I. 6) She states that she has not had any income in 12 months, let alone the\n$78,000 that was referred to in the order. (Id.) She also states that she and her\nhusband live together \u201cbut they are separate\u201d. (/d.)\n\nThe standard for obtaining relief under Rule 59(e) is difficult for Plaintiff to meet.\nThe purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to \u201ccorrect manifest errors of law or fact\nor to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v.\n\nQuinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. 1999). \u201cA proper Rule 59(e) motion . . . must rely\n\n1\non one of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the\navailability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to\nprevent manifest injustice.\u201d Lazaridis v. Wehmer, 591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir. 2010)\n(citing N. River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reinsurance Co., 52 F.3d 1194, 1218 (3d Cir. 1995)).\nA motion for reconsideration is not properly grounded on a request that a court rethink a\ndecision already made. See Glendon Energy Co. v. Borough of Glendon, 836 F. Supp.\n1109, 1122 (E.D. Pa. 1993). Motions for reargument or reconsideration may not be\nused \u201cas a means to argue new facts or issues that inexcusably were not presented to\nthe court in the matter previously decided.\u201d Brambles USA, Inc. v. Blocker, 735 F.\nSupp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990). Reargument, however, may be appropriate where\n\u201cthe Court has patently misunderstood a party, or has made a decision outside the\nadversarial issues presented to the court by the parties, or has made an error not of\nreasoning but of apprehension.\u201d Brambles USA, 735 F. Supp. at 1241 (D. Del. 1990)\n(citations omitted); See also D. Del. LR 7.1.5.\n\nPlaintiff was denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis based upon her answers\nand the combined income of Plaintiff and her spouse (i.e., $129,600). A review of the\norder indicates that the Order incorrectly stated Plaintiffs annual income as $78,000.\nThe correct amount is $6,500; the annual amount of unemployment compensation that\nPlaintiff received. The combined annual income of Plaintiff and her spouse totals\n$58,100. Plaintiff does not qualify for in forma pauperis status when taking into\nconsideration the combined income and the value of their home - $178,000. (See D.I.\n\n1)\nUpon review of the filings in the case, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed\nto demonstrate any of the necessary grounds to warrant a reconsideration of the Court\u2019s\nOctober 14, 2021 Order. Plaintiff must pay the $402 filing fee in full. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1914.\n\nlll. \u00a9 CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will deny the letter/motion for reconsideration.\n\n(D.I. 6)\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\nlL A\n\nChief Judge\n\nDecember 17, 2021\nWilmington, Delaware\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nTAMARA M.
