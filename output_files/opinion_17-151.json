Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 24 \nF.4th 242, 255 (3d Cir. 2022) (\"Crystal/ex IF').2 \nIn this Opinion, the Court addresses , and rejects, what the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, Petr6leos de Venezuela , S.A. (\"PDVSA\"), PDV Holding, Inc. (\"PDVH\"), and \nCITGO Petroleum Corporation ( collectively, the \"Venezuela Parties\") describe as \"the \n1 For example, on August 9, 2018, this Court authorized the issuance of a writ of \nattachment. See generally Crystal/ex Int'! Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 333 F. \nSupp. 3d 380 (D. Del. 2018) (D.I. 79). The Third Circuit affirmed that decision. See generally \nCrystal/ex Int'! Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 932 F.3d 126 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(\"Crysta/lex I\"). The Supreme Court subsequently denied a petition for a writ of certiorari. \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Crystal/ex Int'! Corp., 140 S. Ct. 2762 (2020) (mem.). \n2 On January 14, 2021, this Court issued an opinion denying a motion to quash a writ of \nattachment and a motion for relief from final judgment. See generally Crysta/lex Int 'l Corp. v. \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2021 WL 129803 (D. Del. Jan. 14. 2021) (D.I. 234). The \nCourt also announced at that time that it would appoint a Special Master to design and \nimplement the sale process. See id at * 17. \nIn Crystal/ex 11, the most recent appeal to be generated by this litigation, the Third Circuit \ndismissed the Venezuela Parties' appellate challenge to this Court's denial of the motion to \nquash and the Court's decision to begin developing sale procedures. Applying a \"practical test\" \n-which, in this post-judgment context, asks whether \"all that remains is for a non-judicial officer \nto take and dispose of the defendant 's property\" -the Third Circuit concluded that this Court had \nnot yet reached a final, appealable decision. Crysta/lex 11, 24 F.4th at 249 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The Third Circuit explained: \"The District Court must, at the very least, still \nrule on pending legal objections to the special master's recommended judicial sale procedures. \nThe District Court's judicial involvement is ongoing ... [and] there is no practical finality.\" Id \nThe Third Circuit additionally held that this Court's \"decision to determine sale procedures in the \nfuture with the advice of a special master\" was non-final and unappealable. Id at 256. \n1 fundamental problems \" with the Proposed Sale Procedures Order (\"Proposed Order\")3 submitted \nby the Special Master. (D.I. 423 at 1) These objections have been the subject of extensive \nbriefing (see, e.g., D.I. 316,317,319,339,340,341,343,385,406,408,418,419,421 ,423) and \nnearly a full day of oral argument on November 8, 2021 (see D.I. 409) (\"Tr.\").4 \nI. Neither Evercore Nor The Special Master Has A Disqualifying Conflict Of Interest \nThe Venezuela Parties contend that the role played to date by the Special Master's \ninvestment bank advisor, Evercore Group L.L.C. (\"Evercore\"), and the Special Master's \nproposed role for Evercore in implementing the Proposed Order, create a nonwaivable, incurable \nconflict of interest for Evercore (and perhaps also for the Special Master). In particular , the \nVenezuela Parties point to the Proposed Order's inclusion of a contingenc y fee, or success fee, \nthat could result in payments in excess of $30 million to Evercore. (See D.I. 303 at 11-12)5 In \n3 The most recently-filed version of the Proposed Order is the Third Revised Proposed \nSale Procedures Order. (D.I. 411-1; see also Tr. at 20 (Special Master describing Proposed \nOrder as \"quite lengthy,\" which is unsurprising given that it involves \"a multi-billion dollar \nenterprise \" and reflects input from multiple parties having their own competing \"parochial \ninterest[s]\")) In response , the Venezuela Parties filed an Updated Summary and Status of the \nSales Process Parties' Objections to Sale Procedures Order. (D.I. 423-2) With respect to the \n\"fundamental\" issues addressed by the Court in the instant Opinion, the differences between the \nmultiple versions of the Proposed Order and the various iterations of the Venezuela Parties' \nobjections are largely immaterial. \n4 The Court reviews all objections involving factual or legal issues de nova. (D.I. 277 at \n7; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(\u00b1)(3)) \n5 More specifically , the Venezuela Parties contend: \nEvercore advised the Special Master's design of a proposed sale \nprocedures order while anticipating that it would receive a \ncontingency fee based on the total amount sold. That conflict is \nparticularly acute given that Evercore's fee will also include 0.35% \nof all of the debt of PDVH and its direct and indirect subsidiaries if \n2 the Venezuela Parties' view, Evercore has an interest that could be substantially affected by the \noutcome of the instant proceedings , resulting in Evercore 's impartiality being reasonably \nquestioned. (See D .I. 317 at 16-18) The Venezuela Parties reason that, if the Proposed Order is \nadopted and implemented, \"Evercore will, for [its] own personal gain, encourage [the Special \nMaster] to recommend to the Court a process that ensures the sale of 100% of the PDVH \nShares.\" (D.I. 303 at 12; see also D.I. 317 at 16-18) According to the Venezuela Parties, then, \nEvercore (and possibly the Special Master) must be disqualified under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) and \n(b)(4), and the effort to craft a Proposed Order must begin again. (See Tr. at 47; see also D.I. \n385 at 6 (\"The only way to cure Evercore 's conflict of interest is to reject the Special Master's \nrecommendation and instruct him to conduct a new process after retaining an unconflicted \nfinancial advisor.\"); D.I. 423 at 7) \nThe Court concludes that neither Evercore nor the Special Master suffers from a conflict \nof interest. The Venezuela Parties' requests that Evercore be disqualified and that the Proposed \nOrder be discarded due to a conflict of interest are rejected. Their objections on these points are \noverruled. \nThe judicial impartiality requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 extend to special masters. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 53(a)(2). A special master must be disqualified if he has \"any ... interest that \ncould be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding .\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(4). \nAdditionally , a special master must be disqualified if \"his impartiality might reasonably be \n100% of the shares are sold - a powerful incentive for Evercore to \nstructure and implement a process designed to achieve that result -\neven for a fire sale price -rather than a sale of a minority stake of \nPDVH. \n(D.I. 385 at 2-3) (footnote omitted) \n3 questioned.\" Id. \u00a7 455(a). The relevant inquiry is whether an \"objective, reasonable \nlayperson ,\" who is aware of all the facts, would determine that the judicial officer's impartiality \nmight reasonably be questioned. In re Kensington Int'! Ltd., 368 F.3d 289, 301-03 (3d Cir. \n2004). \nAs an initial matter, a key factual premise underlying the Venezuela Parties' objection is \nnot correct. For the alleged conflict to exist, it is necessary that Evercore be retained not just at \nthe first stage of the Court's process (the design of the Proposed Order) but also at the second \nstage (the implementation of the sale process). (See Tr. at 142, 145, 157-58) Although the \nVenezuela Parties and their financial advisor assert that Evercore has been retained for ( or at \nleast promised) the second-stage assignment , 6 the record does not support this contention . \nInstead, the Special Master has proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and the Court finds, \nthat Evercore has not been promised a contingenc y fee at the implementation stage as partial \ncompensation for work that it has already performed at the design stage. (See, e.g., Tr. at 161-\n62)7 \n6 The Venezuela Parties allege that \"Evercore assumed the roles of advisor, proposer, and \nimplementer of the process, even granting itself a 'success'fee based on the size of the \ntransaction .\" (D.I. 317 at 4) (emphasis added) That is inaccurate, as explained in this section \nof the Opinion. The Venezuela Parties' declarant , Randall J. Weisenburger , has the same \nmisunderstanding. (See, e.g., D.I. 317-1 at 6) (\"Where the Special Master's process went astray \nwas in tasking Evercore with assisting with due diligence and with designing a transaction \nprocess that Evercore itself would eventually run and collect enormous fees for completing.\") \n(second emphasis added) \n7 The Court's conclusion is based on and entirely supported by the record. (See, e.g., Tr. \nat 142 (Venezuela Parties agreeing that Evercore performed work during design stage forfu:ed \nfee); see also id. at 161-62 (Special Master confirming that Evercore was not paid contingency \nfee for work to date)) In an abundance of caution, the Court conferred with the Special Master \non this point. (The parties are reminded that the Court may meet, has met, and expects to \n4 For example, the record includes a declaration from William 0. Hiltz, a Senior Managing \nDirector at Evercore. Mr. Hiltz states: \nOn June 2, 2021, Evercore was engaged to provide investment \nbanking and advisory services in connection with the Special \nMaster's design of a plan for the sale of shares ... as necessary to \ncontinue to meet ex parte with the Special Master. See generally D.I. 277 at 5 (\"The Special \nMaster may communicate ex parte with the Court, any Party, any Party's attorneys, \nConocoPhillips, and ConocoPhillips ' attorneys at the Special Master's discretion as necessary to \ncarry out his duties.\")) The Special Master provided a copy of the June 2, 2021 engagement \nletter between himself, in his capacity as Special Master, and Evercore. (The Court understands \nthat this document was previously provided to all the Sale Process Parties. For the \ncompleteness of the record, the Court will be docketing the engagement letter under seal.) It \nconfirms the Court's finding that Evercore has, to date, been retained to perform only the first\u00ad\nstage work of designing the Proposed Order and not also the second-stage work of implementing \nit. \nThe engagement letter provides : \nThe Special Master acknowledges that the scope of Evercore's \nservices pursuant to this engagement is solely limited to all actions \nreasonably requested by the Special Master in connection with \nobtaining entry of the Sale Procedures Order, including (i) the \ndesign of the Sale Procedures Order, (ii) any testimony or related \nservices to be provided in connection with obtaining entry of the \nSale Procedures Order, and (iii) assisting the Special Master and \nhis counsel to ascertain , pursuant to the Order Regarding Special \nMaster of the Court entered on May 27, 2021 [Docket No. 277], \nthe total amounts of the outstanding judgment owed to Crystallex \nInternational Corp. by the Republic of Venezuela and the total \namount of the outstanding judgment owed to Phillips Petroleum \nCompany Venezuela Limited and ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. \nby PDVSA, it being understood that, absent prior agreement by \nEvercore , Evercore 's services hereunder shall not include \nconducting or facilitating due diligence , contacting or otherwise \ncommunicating with potential buyers , preparing marketing \nmaterials, creating or maintaining a data room or any other \nsubstantive services customaril y rendered by a financial advisor in \na sale process. \n(D.I. 442 at 1-2) (emphasis added; abbreviations omitted) The engagement letter goes on to set \nthe fixed \"work fee\" that Evercore earned for the design stage. \n5 satisfy the outstanding judgment of Crystallex ... and/or devise \nsuch other transaction as would satisfy such outstanding \njudgment(s) while maximizing the sale price of any assets to be \nsold .... \n(D.I. 303-1 Ex. A at 1-2 ( emphasis added); see also id. at 4 (\"I have worked closely with the \nSpecial Master and his other Advisors to assist him with, among other things, designing a sale \nprocess in accordance with his mandate and which balances many competing interests while \nseeking to provide the best opportunity for achieving a value-maximizing Sale Transaction. \") \n(emphasis added)) \nIt is clear that Mr. Hiltz hopes Evercore will obtain the implementation assignment as \nwell. For instance, he notes, \"Evercore has developed relevant experience and expertise \nregarding the Crystallex Case, PDVH, and CITGO that makes it well-suited to advise the Special \nMaster and the Court in connection with entry of the Sale Procedures Order and the ultimate \nimplementation thereof.\" (Id. at 5) But touting Evercore's experience and reputation -which \nthe Venezuela Parties acknowledge (see D.I. 341 at 20)-is not nearly the same as believing (or \nknowing) that the job has already been won. \nWhile the Special Master has recommended that the Court permit him to retain Evercore \nto implement the Proposed Order, and while he has negotiated several drafts of a retention \nagreement with Evercore , he needs the Court's approval to hire Evercore for this assignment. \nLike the Sale Process Parties, 8 he knows that the Court will not grant such approval until after \nconsidering any objections . \n8 The Sale Process Parties are Crystallex and the Venezuela Parties as well as Phillips \nPetroleum Company Venezuela Limited and ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (together, \n\"ConocoPhillips \"). The Sale Process Parties have all contributed to funding the Special \nMaster's work. \n6 Relatedly , in designing the Proposed Order, Evercore knew that the Special Master's \nproposal would be heavily scrutinized and subject to an objections process, after which the Court \nwould decide what to include in the Sale Procedures Order. Accordingly , Evercore knew that if \nEvercore included a provision in the Proposed Order that was based on its self-interest, rather \nthan on what Evercore genuinely believed to be appropriate to the process the Special Master \nwill undertake, one or more of the Sale Process Parties would object, and the Court would likely \nbe persuaded to strike any such provision. At that point, Evercore would also have reasonably \n(and rightly) expected that the Court would disqualify it from any further participation in this \nprocess. The scenario of self-interest posited by the Venezuela Parties is simply implausible. \nWhile the Special Master is subject to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, the parties have not directed the \nCourt to any cases applying the statute to a special master who has been tasked with \nimplementing a judicial sale to satisfy a judgment. Nor has the Court found any such case. \nThus, there appears to be no case law directly supporting the Venezuela Parties' position. \nThe Venezuela Parties' efforts to analogize the circumstances presented here to those in \ncases in which courts have found conflicts of interest are unavailing. For example, in \nKensington , 368 F.3d at 303-04, the Third Circuit determined that supposedly neutral advisors \nappointed to assist a District Judge in asbestos-related matters operated under a \"structural \nconflict of interests\" because they were simultaneousl y serving as advocates for asbestos \nclaimants in a separate, related bankruptc y case. Because that conflict tainted the District Judge, \nhe was disqualified under\u00a7 455. By contrast, here, neither the Special Master nor Evercore \nowes competing fiduciary duties to any person or entity. Evercore's sole job is to maximize the \nvalue of the assets being sold (the PDVH Shares). Moreover , while in Kensington the District \n7 Judge was continuing to rule on the merits of applicable disputes, the merits of the dispute \nbetween Crystallex and the Venezuela Parties were long ago reduced to a final judgment . In this \nposture, the Court is engaged in a post-judgment enforcement proceeding; the Special Master \nand his advisors -like the Court itself -have no occasion to adjudicate the merits of claims \nagainst the Venezuela Parties. \nSimilarly , in In re Kempthorne , 449 F.3d 1265, 1270 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the D.C. Circuit \nrejected a special master's work product because his advisor \"stood to gain financially from\" the \nspecial master reaching a particular result. Kempthorne is not binding on this Court and, more \nimportantly , is inapposite. In that case, the special master hired an advisor who worked for one \nof the players in the underlying dispute against the Department of the Interior. See id. at 1267. \nIn fact, the advisor and his company had accused the Department of wrongdoing, and the \ncompany had unsuccessfully moved to intervene to pursue its own claims against the \nDepartment. See id. Given his employment , the advisor was not impartial in his view of the \nunderlying dispute. Therefore, the D.C. Circuit ordered the suppression of the special master's \nreports, noting that his advisor \"colored the way in which [the special master] approached his \ntask, and ultimately his ... recommendations to the district court. \" Id. at 1270 (internal \nquotation marks and brackets omitted). The relationships among the players in the instant case \nare entirely different. No party has suggested that when Evercore was retained, it had reason to \nfavor one of the Sale Process Parties over the others. Evercore does not stand \"to gain \nfinancially from\" the sale of the PDVH Shares in the way that the Kempthorne advisor would \nhave benefitted from a ruling for his own employer. \nThe Court's procedures provide additional protections against purported conflicts or \n8 misguided incentives tainting the sale process. Those procedures include both those that the \nCourt has followed to date, such as extensive briefing and argument on the Sale Process Parties' \nobjections to the Proposed Order, and those the Court will follow during a similar period of \nobjections and argument after the bidding process has concluded and the Special Master has \nmade whatever recommendations he will make regarding which bid (if any) the Court should \naccept. The Venezuela Parties insist that \"(t]he mere fact that a party may object to tainted \nrecommendations stemming from a conflicted advisor does nothing to obviate the structural \nproblem of having a conflicted advisor in the first place.\" (D.I. 385 at 4) (citing In re Brooks, \n383 F.3d 1036, 1045-46 (D.C. Cir. 2004))9 Whether or not this Court agrees with this \nproposition , the important point is that the Venezuela Parties' argument presupposes that the \nSpecial Master's advisor is conflicted -yet, as explained above, there is no such conflict. \nThe Court agrees with the Special Master that these proceedings have not been tainted by \na proposed contingency fee that has been disclosed and is still being vetted, subject to the parties' \nobjections, and to which all parties other than the judgment debtor have agreed. (See Tr. at 150) \nIn preparing the Proposed Order, the Special Master conducted an open and transparent process, \nengaging repeatedly with the Sale Process Parties and iteratively modifying his proposal in an \neffort to accommodate as many competing concerns as possible while still fulfilling the mandate \ngiven to him by the Court. (See, e.g., D.I. 303 at 18-19) (describing initial engagement with \n9 In Brooks, 383 F.3d at 1046, the D.C. Circuit suppressed the special master's work \nproduct because his advisor \"had personal knowledge of the parties ... from prior dealings with \nthem.\" Here, by contrast, there is no record of any prior dealings between Evercore and the Sale \nProcess Parties. Nor does the Court discern any basis to believe that Evercore's \nrecommendations may have been tainted by \"selection bias\" that might leave \"no trace in the \nrecord.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \n9 Sale Process Parties) As the Special Master has explained, he and his advisors \"have \nendeavored to develop a sale process for the PDVH Shares with two guiding objectives \": \"(i) to \ndesign a process that will result in a sale transaction that is fair, open, and maximizes the value of \nthe PDVH Shares to be sold, and (ii) to ensure the diverse, and frequently conflicting , views of \nthe Sale Process Parties are solicited and considered in the development and implementation of \nsuch a process.\" (D.I. 341 at 1) The challenges of this process are heightened by the fact that \nthis case arises, as the Special Master accurately states, \"in a dynamic and internationall y \nsensitive set of circumstances. \" (D.I. 303 at 1) In other words, the Special Master's task is a \nmonumental and challenging one, as even the Venezuela Parties observe. (See, e.g., D.I. 317 at \n1) (\"The size and complexity of the assets to be sold in this Delaware execution sale are ... \nunprecedented. \")10 It is one that the Court would not be able to undertake successfully without \nthe Special Master's assistance. This context is important and would be known to a reasonable \nlayperson evaluating the Special Master's (and Evercore's) process. \nIt is notable, as well, that everything Evercore has done is consistent with industry \nstandards . (See, e.g., Tr. at 149, 151) Importantl y, nothing Evercore has done to date would, in \nthe Court's view, cause a reasonable layperson, armed with the facts, to question Evercore 's (or \nthe Special Master's) impartiality. Instead, the Court agrees with Crystallex : \"[T]here is nothing \nimproper with compensating the Special Master's financial advisors by paying a properly \ncalibrated Sale Fee based on the outcome of the auction as such a fee can incentivize the \n10 The Venezuela Parties' declarant , Mr. Weisenburger , likewise recognizes that the \nSpecial Master has been given \"an extraordinaril y difficult and unprecedented assignment. \" \n(D.I. 317-1 at 9; see also D.I. 339 at 5 (ConocoPhillips noting that these proceedings are \n\"occurring in an extraordinary legal and foreign policy landscape \")) \n10 financial advisors to obtain the maximum price possible from the sale of a complicated asset.\" \n(DJ. 343 at 6) \nThe Court will order the Special Master to continue his negotiations regarding Evercore 's \npossible retention for the implementation of the Court's Sale Procedures Order.11 As part of that \neffort, the Special Master will be instructed to try to obtain an agreement that Evercore's \ncompensation will not be contingent on the successful sale of the PDVH Shares. (See D.I. 303 \nat 16 n.11; see also Tr. at 148, 152) The realistic prospect of eliminating that provision further \nundermines the Venezuela Parties' claim of a disqualifying conflict of interest. \nAs a final protection, if the Venezuela Parties ( or any of the other Sale Process Parties) \nbelieve that they have a good-faith basis to do so, they may object to the retention of the \ninvestment bank that the Special Master recommends for the implementation stage following his \nnegotiations. To be clear, the Court has overruled the Venezuela Parties' objection that the \nprocess to date has been tainted by an incurable conflict of interest, and the Court does not intend \nto hear additional argument on that issue. Nonetheless , the Sale Process Parties will have an \nopportunity to object to the execution of whatever final retention agreement, with whichever \ninvestment bank, the Special Master recommends after his forthcoming negotiations. \nIn sum, the Venezuela Parties' argument that the process to date is already so tainted by \nconflict that the Court must scrap the Special Master's work and begin again lacks merit. The \nVenezuela Parties acknowledge that Evercore has not yet been paid a contingency fee. (See Tr. \n11 The Court additionally agrees with Crystallex that the Court can \"mitigate [any] \npotential conflict by requiring that any engagement agreement with a financial advisor contain \nprovisions requiring the financial advisor to justify the reasonableness of their fees before they \nare paid.\" (D.I. 343 at 19 n.6) The Special Master will be directed to use his best efforts to \ninclude such a provision in the next version of the retention agreement negotiated with Evercore. \n11 at 142-43) The Venezuela Parties also concede that payment of a contingency fee to an \ninvestment bank that runs the second-stage implementation of the sale is not, per se, a problem. \n(Id. at 144) The problem that the Venezuela Parties are concerned about could be eliminated by \nthe Special Master retaining , for the second stage, an investment bank other than Evercore, or \nretaining Evercore on a non-contingency basis.12 The Special Master will attempt to negotiate a \nnon-contingency retention with Evercore and will thereafter make an updated recommendation \nto the Court as to which investment bank to retain for the implementation stage -and on what \nterms. The Venezuela Parties will have an opportunity at that point to object to that \nrecommendation if they feel that they have a new, meritorious basis to do so. \nAccordingly, for the reasons stated above, nothing that has occurred to date creates either \na disqualifying conflict of interest or even the appearance of partiality for either Evercore or the \nSpecial Master. The Venezuela Parties' objection on this point is overruled. \nII. An OFAC License Is Not Necessary To Continue With The Sale Process, \nAnd The Court Will Not Wait For One \nAs the Special Master writes, one thing all the Sale Process Parties appear to agree on is \nthat \"the most crucial and most polarizing issue for the Court to decide at this stage is when the \nMarketing Process should be launched in relation to obtaining approval or guidance from the \nUnited States Government.\" (D.I. 341 at 3) The parties vehemently disagree with one another \nas to when the Court may, or should, adopt a Sale Procedures Order and begin implementing it. \n12 To the extent the Venezuela Parties argue that the problem cannot be completely \neliminated because Evercore designed the sale process while it was expecting a contingency fee \nfor work performed during the second stage, that argument rests on the faulty premise that the \nSpecial Master already promised to retain Evercore to implement the sale process. As explained \nabove, the Court rejects that premise. \n12 Crystallex requests that the Court adopt a Sale Procedures Order immediately and begin \nthe sale process as soon as possible. In Crystallex's view, the law -and in particular, the \nsanctions regime imposed by the United States on Venezuela -does not preclude the Court from \nadopting a Sale Procedures Order and taking steps in accordance with it, short of executing a \nsale. Crystallex has always agreed that the execution of the sale (but only that last step of the \nsale process) requires a specific license from the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (\"OF AC\").13 As Crystallex writes: \nThe Court should enter a sale procedures order that immediately \ncommences the process of preparing for, advertising, and \nconducting a contingent bidding process for the shares of PDVH to \nfinally satisfy Crystallex's affirmed judgment. Because the \nprocess would only transfer Venezuela 's property after OFAC's \napproval, none of the proposed procedures would violate federal \nsanctions regarding foreign property. \n(D.I. 421 at 1; see also D.l. 343 at 5 (\"OFAC regulations do not prohibit the development of a \nsale process, merely its completion.\")) \n13 Throughout this lengthy litigation, Crystallex has maintained that the completion of \nany sale process (i.e., the transfer of the PDVH Shares) cannot occur unless and until OFAC \nissues a specific license. (See, e.g., D.I. 343 at 14 (\"To be clear Crystallex recognizes that no \nsale can take place without an OFAC license.\"); see also D.l. 234 at 15 (\"All involved in this \nlitigation, including Crystallex, recognize that (under current law and policy) a specific license \nwill be required from OFAC before a sale of PDVSA's shares of PDVH can close.\")) Given \nCrystallex's repeated recognition of this reality, the Court reads Crystallex's most recent \nacknowledgement that \"it will likely need a specific license from OFAC before the PDVH shares \ncan be transferred\" as a clumsy reiteration of its consistent position, not as a first step in a retreat \nfrom it. (D.I. 406 at 4) (emphasis added) \nThe Third Circuit shares the Court's understanding of Crystallex's position. As that \nCourt recently wrote, \"Crystallex ... [has] moved for a contingent auction of PDVSA's shares \npending a license from OFAC.\" Crystallex 11, 24 F.4th at 248; see also id. at 255-57 (containing \nadditional references to Crystallex's request for \"contingent auction\") . \n13 Crystallex further believes that initiating the sale process without a license and without \nany further guidance from OFAC will not necessarily lead to a lack ofrobust participation or the \ndeflation of the PDVH Shares' value. In any event, even if Crystallex is wrong with respect to \nthis prediction, it still believes the process must begin now, given that Crystallex is an affirmed \njudgment creditor who has been waiting to get paid for a decade. (See, e.g., Tr. at 25) (\"We \nhave been waiting for ten years. . . . We're trying to finally get what is due to us.\") \nThe Venezuela Parties see things much differently. In their view, \"launching the \nProposed Sale and Bidding Procedures now would violate federal law, undermine the clearly \nexpressed policy interests of the Executive Branch, and almost certainly result in a foe sale of \nthe PDVH shares in violation of Delaware law.\" (D.I. 408 at 1 (internal citation omitted); see \nalso id. at 3 (suggesting that Proposed Order \"would authorize steps by private parties that are \nunambiguously prohibited under the regulations \") ( emphasis omitted); id. at 6 (\"Without a \nspecific license from OFAC, the Sale Process contemplated by the Special Master cannot be \nlaunched consistent with federal law.\"); D.I. 340 at 2 (\"[C]ommencing the sale process proposed \nby the Special Master without an OFAC specific license is unequivocally barred by OFAC \nregulations at this time, and any participation by bidders, Sale Process Parties, or any third \nparties needed for support in a sale process now would be unlawful.\")) \nThe Venezuela Parties object to adopting a Sale Procedures Order because, in their view, \nthe Court cannot, as a matter of law, take any further steps toward effectuating a sale of the \nPDVH Shares while those shares are blocked property under the current U.S. sanctions regime. \n(See, e.g., D.I. 408 at 11 (\"[T]he Sale Process is barred by the plain meaning of the text of the \nexecutive orders and published regulations .... \"); Tr. at 58 (\"[O]ur fundamental position with \n14 respect to whether the process should go forward is it shouldn't go forward because the sanctions \nregime bars it.\")) According to the Venezuela Parties, the sanctions prohibit not only the final \ntransfer of blocked property, but also all steps that are in any way related to, or undertaken for \nthe purpose of, transferring such property. \nSecond, the Venezuela Parties argue that even if a specific license were not necessary to \nlaunch the sale process, without such a license the market will have so much uncertainty as to \nwhether OFAC will approve an eventual sale that any sale process will be doomed to fail. That \nis, \"moving forward with the Sale Process now would chill bidding and sabotage the ultimate \nsale.\" (D.I. 419 at 9) In other words, proceeding without an OFAC license will result in a \nwinning bid that so undervalues the PDVH Shares that the Court will be required, under \nDelaware law, to reject it. Hence, the Venezuela Parties believe that launching the sale process \nwithout an OFAC license \"would at best be wasteful and unnecessary , and at worst result in a \nviolation of Delaware law.\" (Id. at 10) \nFor his part, the Special Master agrees with Crystallex that the sanctions regime does not \nnecessarily preclude the Court from adopting a Sale Procedures Order and beginning to \nimplement it. (See Tr. at 15) The Special Master does not believe a specific license from \nOFAC is required to launch the sale process. (See, e.g., D.I. 411-1 at 9-10) (proposing launch \nupon receipt of additional \"guidance \" from OFAC) However , the Special Master also believes, \nas an empirical matter, that if the sale process were to begin without more guidance from OFAC, \nthe result is unlikely to be a value-maximizing transaction. \nMore particularly , the Special Master proposes that the Court not launch the sale process \nuntil OFAC provides at least some additional guidance on whether OFAC believes that the sale \n15 process is permissible under current law or whether a specific license to effectuate an eventual \nsale is likely to be granted. \"The Special Master believes that a written statement , or otherwise \npublishable or disclosable information , from OFAC, reflecting authorization or its non-objection, \nwith proceeding with the Marketing Process will be necessary before Potential Bidders will be \nwilling to participate in the Marketing Process.\" (D.I. 411-3 at 8) He adds: \"Uncertainty \nsurrounding what, if any, transaction OFAC will ultimately license creates an overhang that ... \nwill materially chill bidding.\" (D.I. 303 at 35) On this point, the Special Master is supported \nby his financial advisor, Mr. Hiltz of Evercore. (D.I. 303-1 Ex. A at 8) The Special Master \nrecommends that the Proposed Order be adopted and that it include a \"trigger\" such that \nimplementation of the sale process will begin only when the Special Master receives additional \nassurance from OFAC that he can share with the market. (See, e.g., Tr. at 14) (Special Master \nproposing that sale process be launched \"once we get publishable information or guidance from \nOFAC regarding their support [or] non-objection \") \nThe Court has also heard from ConocoPhillips , which does not take a position on the \nlegality of adopting a Sale Procedures Order and implementing it. (See generally D.l. 418; see \nalso Tr. at 62 (ConocoPhillips noting that it successfull y \"worked through [its] issues with the \nSpecial Master\")) ConocoPhillips insists, however, that the parties' disputes on these legal \nissues \"amply demonstrate that launching the sales process without written guidance from OFAC \nwould be a waste of the Court's time and the Sale Process Parties' money.\" (D.I. 418 at 1) \nConocoPhillips supports the Special Master's \"thoughtful compromise ,\" which would defer \nlaunch of the sale process until OFAC issues additional guidance (if it ever chooses to do so). \n(See id.) \n16 After carefully considering the positions of the Sale Process Parties and the Special \nMaster, which have been thoroughl y briefed and argued, the Court has concluded that: (i) the \nlaw, including the current sanctions regime, does not prevent the Court from taking prefatory \nsteps toward a sale of the PDVH Shares, including the adoption a Sale Procedures Order and its \nimplementation; (ii) to reduce the risk that uncertainty about the sanctions regime will deter \nvalue-maximizing bids, the Court will provide the Special Master with a period ofup to six \nmonths after entry of the Sale Procedures Order to recommend that implementation begin ( or \nnot); (iii) during that six-month window, the Special Master will be directed to use his best \nefforts to obtain guidance from OFAC that may be shared with the market expressing OFAC's \nview of the process and the likelihood that it will issue a specific license for a sale to close; and \n(iv) once the Special Master has had an opportunity to seek OFAC input, and after the Special \nMaster makes a recommendation as to whether the sale process should begin , the Sale Process \nParties will have a final opportunity to provide their views on whether the Court should proceed \n-and then the Court will decide whether to do so.14 \nA. Current Law Does Not Prohibit The Court From Launching A Sale Process \nEven Without A Specific License From OFAC For Any Participant \nIn January 2021, the Court stated, as a general matter, that the time had come \"to set up \nthe sales procedures and then to follow them to the maximum extent that can be accomplished \n14 The Court does not believe that proceeding in this manner is likely to be wasteful, \nnotwithstanding the contrary views of the Venezuela Parties and ConocoPhillips. Even if the \nCourt lacked confidence on this point (and it does not), it would still proceed in this manner for \nthe reasons stated throughout this Opinion. Moreover , the Third Circuit recently rejected the \nnotion that the potential for wasteful proceedings should stop this litigation at this point. See \nCrystallex II, 24 F.4th at 255 (enforcing finality requirement despite possibility of wasteful \nproceedings). \n17 without a specific license from OFAC.\" (D.I. 234 at 32-33) Nonetheless , the Venezuela Parties \nare correct that the Court has \"never adjudicated whether the acts, transactions , or agreements \n[specifically] contemplated in the [Special Master's proposed] Sale Process may move forward \nbefore an OFAC license is granted.\" (D.I. 408 at 1) Now that the Special Master has presented \nthe Court with a detailed Proposed Order, and now that the parties have made their objections , \nthe time has come for the Court to address whether the current sanctions regime prohibits \nadoption of a Sale Procedures Order and the launch of the sale process. The Court concludes \nthat nothing prohibits it from taking such actions, even if no party has obtained a specific license \nfrom OFAC. The Court has not been pointed to any legal authority or any other aspect of the \nsanctions regime that bars the Court from proceeding with a sale process, up to and including the \nselection of a winning bidder, provided that legal title to the PDVH Shares is not transferred until \nafter the winning bidder obtains a specific license. \nTo explain the Court's conclusion , it is necessary to first describe the current sanctions \nregime. In March 2015, the President issued an executive order (\"E.O.\") declaring a national \nemergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\"IEEPA\"), 50 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1701 et seq., regarding the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. See generally E.O. 13,692, 80 \nFed. Reg. 12,747 (Mar. 8, 2015). OFAC later promulgated a regulation under which \"[a]ll \ntransactions prohibited pursuant to\" that executive order or any subsequent, related executive \norders \"are prohibited.\" 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.201. A related regulation similarly prohibits \"the \nenforcement of any lien, judgment , arbitral award, decree, or other order through execution , \n18 garnishment, or other judicial process purporting to transfer or otherwise alter or affect property \nor interests in property blocked pursuant to \u00a7 591.201.\" Id \u00a7 591.407.15 \nFrom this starting point, several additional executive orders are potentially relevant. The \nfirst, E.O. 13,808, 82 Fed. Reg. 41,155 (Aug. 24, 2017), provides that \"[t]he purchase, directly or \nindirectly, by a United States person or within the United States, of securities from the \nGovernment of Venezuela ... is prohibited. \" \u00a7 l(b). The Court agrees with Crystallex that this \nprovision \"merely prohibits the actual, complete 'purchase' of securities, and no purchase will be \ncomplete here without an OFAC license.\" (D.I. 421 at 7) Moreover , it is not clear in this case \nthat securities would be purchased \"from the Government ofVenezuela,\"16 as the executive \norder requires, because arguably the PDVH Shares will be purchased from this Court in a forced \njudicial sale. (See D.I. 421 at 6) Regardless , the Venezuela Parties have withdrawn their \nreliance on E.O. 13,808. (See generally D.l. 422) Thus, E.O. 13,808 poses no impediment to \nthe procedures outlined in the Proposed Order. \nThe next potentially relevant executive orders are E.O. 13,850, 83 Fed. Reg. 55,243 \n(Nov. 1, 2018), and E.O. 13,884, 84 Fed. Reg. 38,843 (Aug. 5, 2019). These orders provide that \ncertain property and interests in property related to Venezuela in the United States \"are blocked \nand may not be transferred , paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.\" E.O. 13,850 \n15 For reasons more fully explained below, the Court agrees with Crystallex that, \"[s]ince \nno transfer of blocked property will occur without a license,\"\u00a7 591.407 is \"not implicated. \" \n(D.I. 406 at 7 n.l) \n16 The executive order defines the \"Government of Venezuela \" to include any \n\"instrumentality thereof, including ... PdVSA, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting \nfor or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela. \" E.O. 13,808 \u00a7 3(d); see also E.O. 13,857 \n\u00a7 1, 84 Fed. Reg. 509 (Jan. 30, 2019) (broadening definition to include members of Maduro \nregime). \n19 \u00a7 l(a); E.O. 13,884 \u00a7 l(a). These prohibitions do not apply \"to the extent provided by statutes, \nor in regulations, orders, directives , or licenses that may be issued.\" E.O. 13,850 \u00a7 l(b); E.O. \n13,884 \u00a7 l(c). In relation to these executive orders (as well as E.O. 13,835, as described below), \nthe Court agrees with Crystallex 's logic (D.I. 406 at 7): \"the regulations only prohibit 'transfers' \nthat are 'prohibited pursuant to' an Executive Order\" ( quoting 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.201 ), and \"the \nrelevant Executive Order allows any transfer 'to the extent provided by' a 'licens[e]\"' (quoting \nE.O. 13,850 \u00a7 l(b)). The Proposed Order presented by the Special Master expressly \ncontemplates that no transfer will occur unless and until OFAC provides a specific license to the \nwinning bidder. Accordingly , the Proposed Order does not contemplate any prohibited transfer. \nThe Court, therefore, reaches the same conclusion as Crystallex : \"If OFAC ultimately denies the \nwinning bidder a license at the end of the process, Venezuela retains full ownership of PDVH \nsubject to Crystallex 's existing lien, and no payment flows to Venezuela or any other entity \nblocked by the sanctions - so no violation occurs.\" (D.I. 406 at 7) \nAnother potentially relevant executive order is E.O. 13,835, 83 Fed. Reg. 24,001 (May \n21, 2018), which prohibits transactions related to \"the sale, transfer, assignment , or pledging as \ncollateral by the Government of Venezuela of any equity interest in any entity in which the \nGovernment of Venezuela has a 50 percent or greater ownership interest.\" \u00a7 l(a)(iii) (emphasis \nadded).17 As in E.O. 13,850 and E.O. 13,884, the prohibition in E.O. 13,835 does not apply \"to \nthe extent provided by statutes, or in regulations , orders, directives , or licenses that may be \nissued.\" \u00a7 l(b). In the Venezuela Parties' view, E.O. 13,835 must be read to reach, and \n17 Like E.O. 13,808, the definition for \"Government of Venezuela \" in\u00a7 3(d) of E.O. \n13,835 explicitly includes PDVSA. See also E.O. 13,857 \u00a7 1. \n20 therefore prohibit, much of what is contained in the Proposed Order because\u00a7 1 prohibits \"[a]ll \ntransactions related to\" any \"sale\" or \"transfer\" of the PDVH Shares. (See, e.g., D.I. 408 at 7 \n(\"[T]he Sale Process would violate federal law because it includes numerous transactions \n'related to the sale [or] transfer ... of any equity interest in' PDVH.\") (quoting E.O. 13,835 \n\u00a7 l(a)(iii)); see also id. at 8 (discussing regulatory definition of\"transfer\")) On this view, the \nProposed Order involves \"untold numbers of transactions and interactions by unknown third \nparties that will be related to the eventual sale of blocked property\" that \"require authorization \nfrom OFAC.\" (D.I. 408 at 14) The Venezuela Parties suggest, for example, that a bank \nperforming a wire transfer to effectuate the Venezuela Parties' payment to the Special Master's \nfinancial advisor, without a specific license, might violate the sanctions because that payment \nwould be \"related to\" the eventual \"transfer\" of PDVH Shares. (See Tr. at 60) \nThe Court disagrees with the Venezuela Parties' overly broad interpretation . The \nVenezuela Parties' readings of the .terms \"transfer\" and \"related to\" are not required by the plain \nlanguage of any regulation and have never been formally adopted by OFAC. \nAn OFAC regulation defines \" transfer\" to mean an \"act or transaction \" having the \n\"purpose, intent, or effect\" to \"create, surrender , release, convey, transfer, or alter, directly or \nindirectly, any right, remedy, power, privilege , or interest\" with respect to blocked property. 31 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 591.310.18 The Court agrees with Crystalle x that entering and implementing the \nProposed Order does not involve any \"transfer\" meeting this regulatory definition. Rather, it is \n18 The regulation expressly identifies certain acts and transactions as transfers, including \n\"the appointment of any agent,\" \"the fulfillment of any condition, \" \"the making, execution , or \ndelivery of any ... agreement,\" and \"the making of any payment,\" provided that the definition 's \nother criteria are met. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.310. \n21 the last step of the sale process -i.e., the actual transfer of ownership of the PDVH Shares -that \nwould \"create, surrender, release, convey, transfer, or alter\" any right or interest in the PDVH \nShares, so it is this last step that cannot be taken without the issuance of a specific license from \nOFAC. As Crystallex writes: \"The proposed procedures do not have th[e] prohibited purpose, \nintent, or effect\" required to meet the regulatory definition of \"transfer\" because \"they would \nonly affect rights in blocked property after that property becomes un-blocked.\" (D.I. 421 at 9) \nThe regulations need not, and should not, be read to sweep as broadly as the Venezuela \nParties advocate. Importantly , OFAC has not (at least to date) adopted the broad reading \nespoused by the Venezuela Parties. Instead, in the Court's view, the sanctions regime bars only \n\"agreements,\" \"payments, \" and other acts called out in\u00a7 591.310 that have the imminent or \nactual \"purpose, intent, or effect\" of altering blocked property rights without a license. The \nVenezuela Parties have pointed to no regulatory language that requires their broader \ninterpretation. \nHence, as suggested above, the Court does not agree with the Venezuela Parties that the \n\"Sale Process is replete with acts, agreements , and transactions that meet the regulatory \ndefinition of a 'transfer' of an interest in blocked property, as defined in 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.310 and \nin violation of Executive Order 13850.\" (D.I. 408 at 10; see also D.I. 317 at 15 (\"The concrete \nsteps set out in the Proposed Order have the purpose of creating rights or interests in blocked \nproperty, and many of those steps actually have the effect of creating contingent interests in that \nproperty, all of which are contrary to the text of OFAC regulations.\")) Instead, the Court agrees \nwith Crystallex that none of the specific acts the Court has taken -and none of the specific acts \nthe Proposed Order contemplates being taken, short of executing the sale -\"provide for\" or \n22 \"have the purpose or effect\" of \"altering any interest in blocked property.\" (D.I. 406 at 8) \nThese past and future acts which are permissible absent a specific license include appointing a \nspecial master, retaining an investment bank to implement the sale, advertising the sale, allowing \nCrystallex to credit bid, executing or delivering agreements , and making deposits. (See id. at 8-\n11)'9 \nAs Crystallex argues, \"the regulation is clear that only acts with the 'purpose, intent, or \neffect' of actually altering blocked property rights without a license are prohibited.\" (D.I. 406 at \n2) ( quoting \u00a7 591.310) Moreover , \"the subsequent granting of a license can validate even an \notherwise unlawful transaction. \" (Id.) (citing\u00a7 591.202(c)) Under the Proposed Order, as even \nCrystallex agrees, \"no rights would change hands unless and until a license is ultimately granted\" \nby OFAC. (Id.) Thus, as Crystalle x writes: \"What matters, therefore , is whether a license is \nultimately obtained, not when.\" (Id. at 8)2\u00b0 \nThe breadth of the Venezuela Parties' interpretation of the sanctions might, if correct, \nprevent the Court from proceeding with this litigation. For example, according to the logic of \nthe Venezuela Parties, all of the following acts could not occur without a specific OFAC license, \nbecause all are intended to eventuall y lead to the sale of the presently blocked PDVH Shares: \n19 As noted by ConocoPhillips , the issuance of new certificates for the PDVH Shares \nwould potentially raise additional issues. (See D.I. 418 at 2-3) The Court agrees with \nConocoPhillips that it need not resolve any such potential issues now. (See id.) \n20 A \"transfer ... in violation of' the regulation s is \"null and void,\" but \"a license ... \nissued by OFAC before, during, or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or make it \nenforceable .\" 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.202(a ), (c) (emphasi s added). Contrary to the Venezuela Parties' \ncontention, this regulation does not \"make[] clear that you need a license to move forward.\" \n(Tr. at 52) Instead, by allowing for a license to authorize a transfer even after the fact, the \nregulations contemplate that a process intended to lead ultimately to a transfer can be undertaken \nwithout a license. \n23 \u2022 the Court's appointment of a Special Master; \n\u2022 the Special Master answering inquiries from potential bidders \nfor the PDVH Shares; \n\u2022 Crystallex's filing of a motion or brief or presentation of oral \nargument by in the course of this litigation; and \n\u2022 the issuance of this Opinion by the Court. \nOFAC has given no indication that it reads the regulations as preventing the Court from \nproceeding as it deems fit with the instant case and other related litigation. As Crystallex rightly \nemphasizes, to give the regulations the broad reach sought by the Venezuela Parties would \nunnecessarily implicate serious separation-of-powers concerns. (See, e.g., D.I. 406 at 11) (citing \nPeacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349,356 (1996) (noting courts' \"inherent power to enforce [their] \njudgments\") Again, the Court perceives no reason to read the regulations nearly as expansively \nas the Venezuela Parties would have the Court do. \nAnother argument made by the Venezuela Parties is that the regulations establish that a \n\"grant of a contingent interest in property 'alters' and 'creates' a property interest as soon as it is \nexecuted.\" (D.1. 419 at 3) (brackets omitted) (quoting 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.310) They base this \ncontention on 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.305, which defines \"interests\" to include interests \"of any nature \nwhatsoever, direct or indirect,\" as well as 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.309, which defines \"property \" to \ninclude \"future[] or contingent \" property interests. The Court agrees with Crystallex, however, \nthat these definitions are \"meant to capture transfers of interests that could ripen into a present \nproperty interest without an OFAC license-for example, a 'contingent reversionary interest' in \nfunds that would revert to [ a foreign] government unless its contractor proved performance.\" \n(D.I. 406 at 7-8) (emphasis added) (citing Consarc Corp. v. Iraqi Ministry, 27 F.3d 695, 702 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994)) \"The definition thus prohibits a class of transactions that would otherwise \n24 escape OF AC oversight.\" (Id. at 8) The Proposed Order does not create, or envision the \ncreation of, any such interests. \nThe Venezuela Parties point to a regulation that permits OF AC to \"otherwise provide[]\" \nprospective authorization for a transaction while still maintaining that the transaction was null \nand void before a license issued. (See D.I. 419 at 2-3) (citing 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.202(c)) \nAccording to the Venezuela Parties, \"Crystallex ' s interpretation would rob OF AC of its power to \n'otherwise provide[]' for such a determination -and render this regulatory text meaningless -\nbecause [Crystallex] considers all transactions lawful if they are contingent on an OFAC \nlicense.\" (Id. at 3) The Court is not persuaded by this criticism of Cry stall ex' s position. \nThere is no guarantee that OF AC will retroactively authorize any transaction undertaken without \na license (even though the Court agrees with Crystallex that the regulations empower OFAC to \ndo so if it chooses). By contrast, a prospective authorization by OFAC would provide near\u00ad\ncertainty that the transaction could close. In other words, the interpretation the Court is \nadopting, which permits the sale process to proceed at the risk that OF AC will never permit the \nsale to close, does not deprive OF AC of its power to preapprove a process that is highly likely to \nclose. \nIn sum, the sanctions regime does not require a specific license from OF AC before the \nCourt may adopt a Sale Procedures Order. The Sale Procedures Order that the Court adopts will \ninclude a provision that could allow the sale process to be launched even without a license. \nB. FAQ 809 Does Not Alter The Court's Conclusion \nFrequently Asked Question ( \"FAQ\") 809, which the Venezuela Parties have sometimes \nrelied on (see, e.g., D.I. 408 at 9-10; D.I. 419 at 4-5; id. at 5 n.3), does not alter the Court's \nconclusion . Issued by OFAC on December 9, 2019, FAQ 809 asks whether a U.S. entity with a \n25 writ of attachment for blocked shares is \"authorized to prepare for and hold an auction or other \nsale of the shares, contingent upon the winning bidder obtaining a license.\" (D.I. 150-1 at 2) \nOFAC answers that question as follows: \n(Id.) No. Parties who have attached shares of an entity whose property \nand interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Venezuela \nSanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 591) must obtain a specific \nlicense from OFAC prior to conducting an auction or other sale, \nincluding a contingent auction or other sale, or taking other \nconcrete steps in furtherance of an auction or sale. More \ngenerally, OFAC urges caution in proceeding with any step in \nfurtherance of measures which might alter or affect blocked \nproperty or interests in blocked property. OFAC would consider \nlicense applications seeking to authorize such activities on a case\u00ad\nby-case basis. \nAt the _most recent hearing, the Venezuela Parties expressly told the Court that they \"are \nnot asking this Court to defer to FAQ 809.\" (Tr. at 97) This representation, alone, is sufficient \nfor the Court to hold that FAQ 809 poses no impediment to proceeding even in the absence of \nany specific license authorizing the sale process. The Venezuela Parties offer no persuasive \nreason why, after waiving their reliance on deference to FAQ 809, the Court should now feel \nbound to read FAQ 809 as imposing any hindrance to proceeding as the Court deems warranted . \nIn any event, even if the Venezuela Parties are still advocating for deference to FAQ 809, \nas it appears they may be (see D.I. 419 at 5 n.3), the Court would not defer to this informal \nOFAC statement. Instead, the Court agrees with Crystallex that, under Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. \nCt. 2400 (2019), FAQ 809 lacks the force oflaw and is not entitled to deference , as \"the relevant \nterms of the regulations, such as 'transfer or otherwise alter or affect property,' are clear by \nthemselves and do not require OFAC's guidance , nor implicate its substantive expertise. \" (D.I. \n26 421 at 9) Agencies cannot use interpretive guidance to expand the scope of an unambiguous \nregulation and thereby \"create de facto a new regulation. \" Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2415 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Kisor requires courts to \"give[] agencies their due, while also \nallowing -indeed, obligating -courts to perform their reviewing and restraining functions .\" Id. \nThe Court has performed its reviewing function, disagrees with FAQ 809, and finds no basis to \naccord any deference to FAQ 809. \nGuidance that does not implicate an agency's \"substantive expertise\" is entitled to little, if \nany, deference. See id. at 2417. FAQ 809 is addressing whether an Article III court can move \nforward with a process that may ultimately lead to a transfer of blocked property. This subject, \nand the litigation process in general, is outside the \"substantive expertise \" of OFAC and the U.S. \nTreasury Department. By contrast, the power to enforce judgments is among the core functions \nof the federal judiciary. As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[a]bsent the clearest command to the \ncontrary from Congress ,\" courts retain power to enforce their judgments . See Califano v. \nYamasaki. , 442 U.S. 682, 705 (1979); see also Peacock, 516 U.S. at 356 (\"Without jurisdiction to \nenforce a judgment entered by a federal court, the judicial power would be incomplete and \nentirely inadequate for the purposes for which it was conferred by the Constitution.\") (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nFinally, agency statements are not entitled to significant deference when they do not \nreflect the \"fair and considered judgment \" of the agency. Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2417. As OFAC \nhas explained , its FAQs \"are intended only as general information to assist persons subject to \nUnited States jurisdiction to comply with legal requirements and to facilitate an understanding of \nthe scope and purposes of sanctions programs. \" Note on Frequently Asked Questions , OFAC, \n27 https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions /frequently-asked-questions/note-on\u00ad\nfrequently-asked-questions (last visited Feb. 28, 2022). Moreover, the Court has the benefit of \nOFAC's \"fair and considered judgment\" about this very litigation, as discussed below. \nFor all these reasons, OFAC's FAQ 809 does not prevent the Court from moving forward \nwith the sale process.21 \nC. OFAC's Denial Of Crystallex's License Application Does Not Alter The \nCourt's Conclusion \nOFAC's September 10, 2021 decision to deny Crystallex's application for a specific \nlicense does not alter the Court's conclusion. To the contrary, OFAC's view, as expressed in the \ndenial letter, is entirely consistent with the Court's view. In particular, OFAC appears to agree \nthat, as long as the Court continues to ensure that no actual transfer of the PDVH Shares will \noccur unless and until OFAC issues a specific license permitting such a transaction, OFAC \ncannot stop the Court from taking prefatory steps that are necessary and helpful to selecting a \nwinning bidder for the PDVH Shares so that Crystallex's judgment may be satisfied.22 As the \n21 The Venezuela Parties assert that many additional published FAQs \"and other \nauthorities predating this litigation\" state that \"prohibited transactions cannot be made legal by \nmaking them contingent on an OFAC license.\" (D.l. 419 at 4; see also id at 4 n.2 (citing other \nFAQs); D.I. 420-1 (Hall Deel.) at 1) The Court has reviewed the other cited sources, and they \ndo not alter the Court's analysis. In particular, the Venezuela Parties point to an enforcement \naction in which OFAC concluded that Aero Sky violated the Iranian sanctions regime when it \nentered into a memorandum of understanding with Mahan Air, an Iranian commercial airline \ncompany, even though the agreement was \"contingent, in part, upon Mahan Air being removed\" \nfrom OFAC's list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons. (D.I. 420-1) The \nCourt will not defer to OFAC's interpretation of different sanctions in an unrelated case, \nparticularly when the accused violator in that case never had a chance to defend itself before the \nagency. See generally Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2415-17. \n22 In the summer of 2020, the United States submitted a statement of interest and a \nsupplemental brief in support of that statement, asking the Court not to proceed with a sale \n28 Court previously recognized, OFAC has \"not taken the position that the Court is blocked from \nmoving forward.\" (D.I. 234 at 34 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also D.I. 226 at 105 \n(U.S. stating \"the Court can do whatever it wants\"); see also Crystal/ex II, 24 F.4th at 248 \n(quoting same government statement))23 As evidenced by the recent OFAC letter denying \nCrystallex's license application, OFAC continues to adhere to this view. \nWhile Crystallex's application for a specific license is not in the record, Crystallex and \nthe Venezuela Parties agree that Crystallex sought express OFAC approval for not only the \nexecution of a final sale, but also the initiation and undertaking of the sale process. (See, e.g., \nprocess, due to concerns of foreign policy and national security. (See generally D.I. 212,220) \nThe Court chose to proceed, notwithstanding these policy concerns. (See D.I. 234 at 14-15) \nAlthough the United States has opted not to submit any additional filings, the Court presumes \nthat the Executive Branch still prefers that the Court cease its progress toward a sale, unless and \nuntil OFAC issues a specific license. OFAC appears to recognize that it can make this request, \nbut cannot compel the Court to grant it. \n23 The Venezuela Parties are wrong to suggest that the Executive Branch has advocated \nbefore this Court that a specific license is required for the Court to proceed with the sale process. \nFor example, the Venezuela Parties write: \nWhen the United States Government appeared before this Court in \nSeptember 2020, it clarified that a license was necessary before \nmoving forward with a sale process, and that \"setting a sales date\" \nfor the PDVH shares \"is exactly the kind of thing Special \nRepresentative Abrams has said, speaking for the United States, \nwould imperil U.S. foreign policy interests.\" \n(D.I. 408 at 2) (quoting D.I. 226 at 103-04) While the second part of this statement is correct \nand the Executive Branch has espoused the view that the Court should not move forward \n(because of U.S. foreign policy and national security interests) , the Court is not aware of the \nExecutive Branch telling this Court that it cannot proceed with a sale process unless and until \nOFAC issues a specific license (i.e., that a license is \"necessary\"). The Venezuela Parties \nconflate purported legal constraints (a position OFAC has not advocated in this Court) with \npolicy considerations (which fall squarely within the Executive Branch's discretion and which \nthe Court continues to recognize as vitally important). \n29 D.I. 182 at 7 (Venezuela Parties characterizing Crystallex's application as being for \"formal \napproval of the commencement of the sale process\") ; Tr. at 48 (Venezuela Parties: \"That license \nrequest was not just to sell the shares. It was to effect the sale of the shares, and in Crystallex 's \nown words, it was to launch the sales process.\"); D.I. 212-2 at 1 (OFAC Director: \"Crystallex \nsubmitted a specific license application requesting OFAC 'to provide Crystallex [with] a Specific \nLicense to allow [this Court] ... to pursue all activities necessary and ordinarily incident to \norganizing and conducting a judicial sale of the [PDVH] shares .... \"'))24 In other words, \nCrystallex filed a two-part license application , seeking approval for both (i) the initiation and \nconducting of the sale process and (ii) the actual sale of the PDVH Shares. OFAC's rejection of \nthe requested two-part license tells the Court essentially nothing about whether OFAC would \nhave rejected a narrower application seeking approval for only the initiation and conducting of \nthe sale process. \nThis conclusion is fully supported by a careful analysis of the OFAC letter, the \noverwhelming majority of which is devoted to addressing Crystallex's request for approval to \nsell the PDVH Shares (as opposed to its request merely to initiate and conduct the sale process). \nBy the Court's count, the OFAC letter contains at least 23 references to a \"sale\" of the PDVH \nShares.25 These references confirm that OFAC was focused on the portion of Crystallex's \n24 But see D.I. 406 at 13 (Crystallex explaining that it \"was merely asking for permission \nfor activities necessary to effectuate the final sale -not permission to even prepare for a sale\"). \n25 For example, the letter contains the following statements: \n\u2022 \"Absent a license from OFAC, any sale of the PDVH shares is \nprohibited pursuant to OFAC's Venezuela-related sanctions \nauthorities,\" including E.O. 13,808, E.O. 13,835, E.O. 13,850, and \n30 application seeking approval for the transfer of ownership of the PDVH Shares; at no point in the \nletter did OFAC express any concern about the Court undertaking a process that could ultimatel y \nE.O. 13,884. (D.I. 346-1 at 1) (emphasis added) \n\u2022 \"[A]uthorizing the sale of the PDVH shares at this time would be \ninconsistent with United States foreign policy interests .... \" (Id.) \n( emphasis added) \n\u2022 \"A request for a specific license for the sale of the PDVH shares is \ntherefore denied without prejudice to reconsideration at a later time \nif the foreign policy consideration s change.\" (Id.) ( emphasis \nadded) \n\u2022 \"The United States will reassess whether the sale of the PDVH \nshares is consistent with United States foreign policy, as the \nsituation in Venezuela evolves.\" (Id. (emphasis added); see also \nid. at 5 (similar)) \n\u2022 The \"State Department 's assessment\" was that \"aforced sale of \nVenezuela's U.S.-based assets (particularly the CITGO assets) at \nthis time would be inconsistent with U.S. foreign policy interests.\" \n(Id. at 2) ( emphasis added) \n\u2022 \"Crystallex 's license request here is not for a similar negotiated \nagreement with the Government of Venezuela, but instead for a \nforced sale .... \" (Id.) ( emphasis added) \n\u2022 The letter announces OFAC's \"determination to deny the license \nfor the sale at this time.\" (Id. (emphasis added); see also id. \n(\"[O]ur view [is] that a license for the sale of the PDVH shares \nshould be denied at this time.\") (emphasis added) \n\u2022 \"Crystallex's proposed sale is prohibited under U.S. law, unless \nauthorized by an OFAC license.\" (Id. at 5) (emphasis added) \n\u2022 \"[D]enying Crystallex 's request to sell the PDVH shares will [not] \nnecessarily have the consequences Crystallex predicts .... \" (Id.) \n( emphasis added) \n31 lead to executing a sale.26 (See, e.g., D.I. 346-1 at 1) (\"[D]enying the license at present and \ncontinuing the blocking of these shares is particularl y important at this time.\") (emphasis added) \n26 The Court perceives an argument (which no party has made) that the letter's many \nreferences to \"sale\" are intended to refer to the \"sale process,\" not just \"execution of the sale\" \n(i.e., the actual transfer of the shares). The word \"sale\" has more than one meaning. For \ninstance, a \"sale\" of shares could refer to (a) the process of trying to reach the point at which an \nactual transfer of ownership and title in the shares passes from one entity to another, or (b) the \nactual transfer of ownership and title in the shares from one entity to another. The first usage \nencompasses the \"sale process,\" while the second usage refers to a \"transaction. \" A popular \ndictionary recognizes both usages of the word \"sale\" as proper: \n1 : the act of selling \nspecifically : the transfer of ownership of and title to property from one person to \nanother for a price [ usage (b) above] \n2 a : opportunity of selling or being sold [ usage ( a) above] \nSale, Merriam-Webster , Inc., https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary /sale (last visited Feb. \n28, 2022). \nIn context, it is clear that the many instances of the word \"sale\" in the OFAC letter are \ndirected to the \"transaction ,\" not the \"sale process.\" In addition to what the Court has already \nsaid on this point, it is noteworth y that the letter references Crystallex 's contention that \n\"'significant benefits\"' will flow to Venezuela if Crystalle x's license application were granted , \nincluding that \"'[a] sale of PDVH would generate funds for Venezuela. \"' (D.I. 346-1 at 7) \nThis instance of the word \"sale\" indisputably refers to a transaction involving the exchange of \nmoney and not just the sale process. While OFAC rejected as \"not persuasive \" Crystallex 's list \nof other purported benefits for Venezuela if a license were granted, those benefits could flow \nonly from a completed transaction , not from the process of trying to find a winning bidder. (Id) \nOFAC's letter uses \"sale\" only once to refer to the \"sale process,\" and in context, that \nusage is also clear. (See id at 1) (referring to \"all activities necessary and ordinarily incident to \norganizing and conducting a judicial sale of shares\") ( emphasis added) This one instance \nillustrates that OFAC's denial was about Crystallex's request to execute a sale transaction and not \nabout conducting a sale process. \n32 Most pertinently, the OFAC letter contains a section with the heading \"U.S. court \njudgments.\" (Id. at 4-5) Like the rest of the letter, this section is entirely consistent with the \nCourt's view that it may proceed with prefatory steps toward a sale, as long as the sale does not \nclose. In this part of the letter, OFAC's Director, Andrea M. Gacki, notes Crystallex's complaint \nthat denying its license '\"will render the legitimate judicial orders of several federal courts \nineffectual.\"' (Id. at 4) OFAC \"disagree[s] with Crystallex's characterization,\" suggesting that \nits denial of Crystallex's application does not conflict with this Court's decision to proceed. \n(Id.) Director Gacki goes on to explain: \"we are mindful of the Judicial Branch's interest in \nenforcing its judgments , and we have carefully weighed that consideration in making our \nlicensing decision. At the same time, we have also considered the Executive Branch's foreign \npolicy and national security interests.\" (Id.) This explanation balances, on one hand, the role \nof this Court to proceed so that it may, eventually , enforce its judgment and, on the other hand, \nthe role ofOFAC to evaluate policy considerations and bring them to bear on the timing of any \nenforcement involving the sale of blocked property. That balance is entirely consistent with the \napproach that this Court has taken and will continue to take. \nThe harmonious relationship between OFAC's view and the Court's view is confirmed by \nthe next paragraph of Director Gacki's letter, which quotes this Court without any suggestion of \na disagreement: \nOn July 16, 2020, the U.S. government filed a Statement of \nInterest in the Crystallex litigation before the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Delaware, explaining the U.S. government 's \ncurrent foreign policy and national security view. After \nconsidering that statement, the Court elected to proceed with \n33 prefatory steps toward a judicial sale,[27] but the Court made clear \nthat \"the OFAC licensing process provides the [appropriate] \nmechanism through which the Executive Branch can bring to bear \nthe foreign policy and national security interests on which \nCrystallex's collection efforts might have an impact.\" Crystallex , \n2021 WL 129803, at * 16. The Court further stated that all parties \nto the litigation \"recognize that (under current law and policy) a \nspecific license will be required from OFAC before a sale of \nPdVSA's shares of PDVH can close.\" Id. Thus, it appears to us \nthat the Court recognized that the Executive Branch's foreign \npolicy and national security interests, if asserted through the OFAC \nlicensing process, could properly necessitate a delay in \neffectuating court judgments . Accordingly , OFAC has \nconsidered the foreign policy and national security interests in \nconnection with Crystallex 's license request, and OFAC's denial of \na license for the sale reflects those interests at this time. \n(Id. at 5) (emphasis added) The letter demonstrates that OFAC clearly understands that the \nCourt has been undertaking -and will continue to undertake -prefatory steps toward a sale, but \nit does not go on to say anything else about those prefatory steps. Instead, the letter expresses \nOFAC's seeming contentment with the Court's recognition that a specific license will be required \nto execute a sale and that OFAC has discretion to consider foreign policy and national security in \ndeciding whether to grant such a license. The best reading of Director Gacki's letter is that \nOFAC does not view any law or other authority as precluding the Court from proceeding with \nthe sale process. As Crystallex correctly observes: \"Despite expressly acknowledging the \nCourt's decision to proceed with prefatory steps toward a sale, OFAC lodged no policy or legal \nobjections to any steps the Court is currently taking or considering to prepare for a sale once a \nlicense is granted.\" (D.I. 406 at 2; see also id. at 12 (\"OFAC expressed no concern on policy or \n27 Here, OFAC seems to agree with the distinction the Court has made between \"steps in -\na sale process\" and the final \"sale\" itself. \n34 sanctions grounds with any of the steps the Court is taking or considering at this time to prepare \nfor an eventual sale once a license is granted.\")) \nThe OFAC letter concludes: \"Accordingly , your request for a specific license to effect the \nsale of the PDVH shares is denied at this time.\" (D.I. 346-1 at 8) (emphasis added) The Court \nreads this conclusion as limited to the portion of Crystallex 's request for a specific license to \neffectuate the transfer of the PDVH Shares to a winning bidder. OFAC's conclusion does not \ndeny (or even substantially address) Crystallex 's related request merely to initiate the process \nthat would ultimately result in effectuating the sale of the PDVH Shares. Indeed, OFAC writes: \n\"In light of this denial, we are not addressing the other aspects of your request at this time, which \nOFAC will continue to consider\" under the same application number. (Id.) \nThe OFAC letter also states repeatedly that the license denial is \"without prejudice\" and \nmay be reconsidered if the foreign policy considerations change. (Id. at 1, 5, 8) Indeed, the \nletter concludes: \"OFAC emphasizes that this determination is made without prejudice to \nreconsideration of a specific license request to sell the PDVH shares at a later time if the foreign \npolicy considerations change.... The United States will reassess whether the sale of the PDVH \nshares is consistent with United States foreign policy, as the situation in Venezuela evolves.\" \n(Id. at 8) ( emphasis added) \nAs a final indication of OFAC's and the Court's harmonious views, the Court will now \nquote Director Gacki's use of a quotation from the Court's January 14, 2021 Opinion, which \nevidently accurately describes OFAC's own apparent view of its own discretion: \nOFAC's discretionary authority to issue or withhold licenses is \nessential to the U.S. government's ability to tailor sanctions to \nevolving foreign policy and national security needs. As the Court \nhas noted, \"the OFAC licensing process provides the [appropriate] \n35 mechanism through which the Executive Branch can bring to bear \nthe foreign policy and national security interests on which \nCrystallex's collection efforts might have an impact.\" \n(D.I. 346-1 at 3) (quoting D.I. 234 at 34) Again, the Court discerns no disagreement between it \nand OFAC. The Court has received no indication from OFAC that it believes the Court lacks \nthe authority to proceed with a sale process ( excluding the execution of an actual sale \ntransaction) in the absence of a specific OFAC license. (See D.I. 341 at 5) (Special Master \nstating that, in his interactions with government personnel , \"they have at no point ... asked \n[him] to or suggested that [he] should delay the process\")28 \nIn light of OFAC's discretionary authority , and the absence of any indication from any \nU.S. governmental entity (including OFAC) that this Court cannot proceed, the Court will \nproceed with the sale process, up to and including selecting a winning bid.29 The Court will not, \nhowever, permit the sale to be executed unless and until OFAC grants a specific license (or \nunless and until the sanctions regime is materiall y changed) . \nD. The Current Sanctions Regime Does Not Prohibit The Sale Process \nThe Court's interpretation of the sanctions regulations as set out in this Opinion is \nconsistent with what the Court previously stated: the interests of the Executive Branch (including \nthe President's power to determine foreign policy and to protect national security) are fully and \n28 Just as OFAC seems to acknowledge, the Third Circuit also recognizes that this Court \n\"agree[s] that OFAC's approval would be necessary to complete the transaction and transfer \ntitle.\" Crystallex II, 24 F.4th at 256; see also id. at 257 (\"The District Court said it would go \nonly as far as OFAC's regulations allow and acknowledged that OFAC's approval will be needed \nto complete a sale.\"). \n29 As always, the Court's current plan may change if there are material developments in \nthis case. \n36 adequately implemented through the OFAC licensing process, which will determine when-if \never -the sale of the PDVH Shares can actually close. (See, e.g., D.I. 234 at 34 (\"[T]he OFAC \nlicensing process provides the better mechanism through which the Executive Branch can bring \nto bear the foreign policy and national security interests on which Crystallex's collection efforts \nmight have an impact.\"); D.I. 408 at 2 (Venezuela Parties: \"In its January 14, 2021 Order, this \nCourt found that OFAC's licensing process was the appropriate method for the Executive Branch \nto effectuate its policy interests .... \") The Court understands the Third Circuit to hold the same \nposition. See Crysta/lex I, 932 F.3d at 151 (\"Though the U.S. State Department has not sought \nto provide a statement of interest, it is nonetheless conceivable that short-or long-term U.S. \nforeign policy interests may be affected by attachment and execution of PDVSA's assets. The \n[OFAC] sanctions provide an explicit mechanism to account for these.\"). \nThe Court presumes that OFAC remains free to say that it will never issue a specific \nlicense to allow the PDVH Shares to be sold. If that is the case, it would be helpful for all \ninvolved in this case (and in related litigation) for OFAC to say so. Without an express \nindication that this is OFAC's view, the Court has an obligation to work toward execution of \nCrystallex's judgment, and it will continue do so. \nThe Venezuela Parties warn: \"Marching forward in the absence of an OFAC license will \nnot just risk potential civil and criminal liability for those private parties [ who participate in the \nsale process], it could also prompt further litigation over the validity of the acts and transactions \nexecuted, here and perhaps in other courts.\" (D.I. 408 at 9)30 The Court agrees with \n30 See, e.g., 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.202(a), (e) (declaring \"null and void\" certain actions with \nrespect to blocked property taken in contravention of sanctions regime). \n37 Crystallex , however, that liability requires a \"willful\" violation of the sanctions and, given the \nCourt's view of the sanctions , the participation of private parties in a judicially ordered process \ncannot constitute a willful violation of the law. (See D.I. 406 at 14-15) While the Court is not \neager to embrace the prospect of \"further litigation\" about the validity of this same litigation , \nthere is plainly no lack of litigation related to Venezuela 's debts. This Court cannot, and will \nnot, be deterred from fulfilling its judicial function by the threat or risk of further litigation . \nThe Venezuela Parties are correct that, under IEEPA, \"the political branches have \nconstitutional authority to stop courts from attaching, or disposing of attached, foreign-owned \nproperty in the United States.\" (D.I. 408 at 11) (citing Bank Markazi v. Peterson , 136 S. Ct. \n1310, 1328 (2016); Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654,674,686 (1981); Behring Int'/, Inc. \nv. Imperial Iranian Air Force, 699 F.2d 657,660 (3d Cir. 1983)) To date, the Executive Branch \nhas not, however, stopped this Court from undertakin g the sale process (short of executing the \nsale) for property that was attached before it became blocked. That is, the Executive Branch has \nnot exercised any authority it may have under the Constitution and/or IEEPA to stop something \nthat this Court has done or is doing. Unless the Executive Branch takes such an explicit action \n(which the Court would then evaluate), or unless an appellate court directs this Court otherwise , \nthe Court will continue to understand that the Executive Branch will act through the OFAC \nlicensing process .31 The Court agrees with Crystalle x: \"Given the significant separation-of-\n31 The Venezuela Parties write: \"If the Executive Branch may block, nullify, and void a \n_ sale of blocked property in a judicial proceeding , it plainly can require Crystallex to obtain a \nlicense from OFAC before proceeding with such a sale process.\" (D.I. 419 at 8) Even \nassuming this legal analysis is correct, the fact remains that OFAC has not expressly required \nCrystallex to obtain such a license at this time (i.e., just to proceed with a sale process), \nnotwithstanding that it had an opportunity to say so when it denied Crystallex 's license \n38 powers implications of curbing the judicia.ry's ability to enforce its judgments, the President \nwould at least need to speak clearly before his executive orders could have th[ e] effect\" of \nstopping this Court's sale process. (D.I. 421 at 7; see also Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, \n857-58 (2014) (explaining that, absent \"a clear indication, \" courts generally avoid reading \nfederal statutes as \"dramatically intrud[ing]\" on other entities' jurisdiction) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nFinally, the Venezuela Parties contend that \"[a]llowing PDVH shares to be sold at a fire\u00ad\nsale for a fraction of [their] value would sap the Guaid6 government of its economic power, deal \na serious blow to its goal ofrepaying its predecessors ' global debts ... and undermine its \nlegitimacy.\" (D.I. 340 at 5) All that may be so (and would be regrettable), but those concerns \nare not properly before this Court. The Executive Branch has the power to prioritize foreign \npolicy and national security interests over the property interests of an affirmed judgment creditor \nin the U.S. courts. If that is how the Executive Branch weighs those considerations, it may \nmake its decision known, and no sale of the PDVH Shares will close. In the meantime, this \nlitigation proceeds, and the Court will continue with its work. \nThe Court reiterates the view it announced approximately a year ago: the \"most \nreasonable\" course of action is to establish the sale procedures and then \"follow them to the \nmaximum extent that can be accomplished without a specific license from OFAC.\" (D.I. 234 at \n32-33; see also D.I. 406 at 13 (Crystallex: \"The regulation has not changed since January 2021 \nwhen this Court recognized that preparatory steps were allowed.\")) Today, the Court adds that \napplication . Moreover, OFAC has never indicated that this Court may not proceed in the \nabsence of any party having a license. \n39 the \"maximum extent\" includes all necessary and helpful steps in the process for selling the \nPDVH Shares, short of execution of the sale. \nIII. The Proposed Sale Procedures Order Will Include A Six-Month Window Trigger \nBased on his expertise and the recommendations of his advisors, the Special Master has \nstated he \"would not recommend nor ... intend to launch the Marketing Process until [he is] \nsatisfied with the posture of OFAC because of the likelihood that Potential Bidders would be \nunwilling to participate in the process.\" (D.I. 341 at 4) (emphasis added)32 The Court \nwelcomes the Special Master's assessment as to the opportune time to launch the sale process, \nincluding, in particular , his view on whether OF AC has provided or will provide a statement that \ncould give potential bidders sufficient confidence to expend the time and money necessary to \nparticipate in the process. The Court is not agreeable , however, to an indefinite delay of the \nstart of the process without (a) requiring the Special Master to make a recommendation on \nwhether and when to start and (b) providing the Sale Process Parties with an opportunity to \nobject to that recommendation. \nAccordingly, the Sale Procedures Order the Court will enter will include a Six-Month \nWindow Trigger. That is, the Sale Procedures Order will provide for a period, of no more than \nsix months from the date of the order's entry, for the Special Master to: (i) attempt to obtain \ngreater clarity from OF AC, in a form he can share with the market, of its support for ( or at least \nnon-opposition to), the sale process; and (ii) make a recommendation to the Court as to when, \nand whether, the Court should launch the sale process. \n32 There is no inconsistency between the Special Master's position on this empirical point \n(regarding the best time to start the sale process) and the Court's holding that it has the legal \nauthority to begin the process at any time the Court chooses. \n40 All parties will have an opportunity to object to whatever recommendation the Special \nMaster makes, at whatever point within (and no later than at the end of) the Six-Month Window , \nto launch (or not launch) the sale process. The Court will carefully evaluate any objections and \nmake an independent determination of how to proceed. Any outcome is possible: the Special \nMaster may recommend that the Court launch the sale process and the Court may do so or not, or \nthe Special Master may recommend that the Court not launch the sale process and, again, the \nCourt may or may not launch it. \nThe Court expects there will be many beneficial consequences from the Six-Month \nWindow Trigger. First, as noted, it will give the Special Master time to communicate with \nOFAC -and for OFAC to review further, if it wishes, the status of this (and related) litigation -\nwhich will hopefully provide greater clarity to the market as to the risks and likely licensing \noutcome of the sale process, thereby encouraging more participation and making a value\u00ad\nmaximizing bid more likely.33 Second, it puts the Sale Process Parties on notice that the Court \nwill be making a determination as to whether to start the sale process later this year -not \nimmediately , as Crystallex wishes, but not never (or at some distantly indeterminate date), as the \n' \nVenezuela Parties appear to prefer. Third, the Six-Month Window will inform others holding \njudgments against the Venezuela Parties that this Court is on the cusp of launching the sale \nprocess, which may inform their litigation activities. Fourth, the Court is hopeful that during the \nSix-Month Window the parties will engage with the Special Master (or any other individual they \n33 The Special Master reports that \"as things stand today, there is enough uncertainty that \nPotential Bidders will likely discount their bids in light of such uncertainty or not even \nparticipate in the process at all.\" (D.I. 341 at 4) \n41 prefer) in a good faith attempt to resolve this case through mediation. Fifth, as further described \nbelow, the Court may use the six-month period to certify an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit in hopes of obtaining a definitive , binding legal \ndetermination as to the impact of the current sanctions regime on the sale process. Sixth, it is \nalways possible that there will be developments in Venezuela , or an evolution in U.S. foreign \npolicy and/or the sanctions regime, that could have a material impact on how the Court should \nproceed.34 \nNotwithstanding these benefits, the Court recognizes that the pace at which the Court \nforesees moving will likely disappoint the parties. It is quite possible that the Special Master \nwill determine , at the end of the Six-Month Windo w, that conditions are not auspicious for \n34 OFAC itself has observed : \"As the situation in Venezuela has continued to evolve, U.S. \nforeign policy has also evolved.\" (D.I. 346-1 at 4) The Court is aware that in January 2022, \nthe U.S. government reiterated its recognition of \"the authority of the democratically elected \n2015 National Assembly as the last remaining democratic institution and Juan Guaid6 as \nVenezuela's interim president.\" Ned Price, US Recognition of Venezuela s 2015 National \nAssembly and Interim President Guaid6, U.S. Department of State (Jan. 4, 2022), \nhttps://www.state.gov /u-s-recognition-of- venezuelas-2015-national-assembly-and-interim\u00ad\npresident-guaido / (last visited Feb. 28, 2022). The Court further understands that on January 20, \n2022, OFAC issued General License 51 and, according to the Venezuela Parties, extended a \nprohibition on \"transactions related to the sale or transfer of' the CITGO Holding, Inc. shares \nserving as collateral for certain 2020 Bondholders. (D.I. 434) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) The parties have provided the Court with competing prognostications as to how U.S. \nforeign policy may or may not change, and as to whether the political situation in Venezuela \n( e.g., as between the Guaid6 administration and Maduro regime) will imminently change. \n(Compare , e.g., D.I. 429 (\"U.S. foreign policy towards Venezuela has not changed, and is \nunlikely to do so in the foreseeable future.\") with D.I. 406 at 13 (Crystallex predicting that \"the \ngovernment anticipates more than routine reevaluation\" early in 2022, which \"could be an \ninflection point for a policy change\") and D.I. 431 at 1 (\"[T]he situation in Venezuela \nundoubtedly will continue to evolve [through] the coming year and there is no reasonable basis \non which to speculate that OFAC is unlikely to change its position.\")) The Court's decisions are \nmade with an understanding of current policy and not based on any predictions of what may or \nmay not happen in the future. \n42 proceeding (for reasons that may or may not include a lack of progress in his interactions with \nOF AC). In that event, it is also quite possible that Crystallex will object to his recommendation \nthat the Court not launch the sale process, and it would take additional time for the Court to \nevaluate and resolve such an objection . \nOn the other hand, the Court has also squarely rejected the view of the Venezuela Parties \n(and ConocoPhillips) that the sale process may not be launched until after OFAC issues a \nspecific license. The Court's legal holding sets up the very real possibility that the Court will \nlaunch the sale process without a specific license -even if the Special Master recommends that \nthe Court not do so. In other words, even if it turns out that OF AC will not provide an \nindication of non-objection to the sale procedures , and if it appears that the market may not fairly \nvalue PDVH, the Court may nonetheless proceed with initiating the sale process. \nThe litigation before the Court simply cannot be permitted to continue forever. The \nCourt is not persuaded today, and it is unlikely to be persuaded , that any set of circumstances \nwill necessarily and inevitably doom the sale process to conclude with a result that cannot \nsatisfy Crystallex 's judgment in full and/or will yield such an inequitable result that the Court \nwill have to reject it. Moreover , as Crystalle x persuasively points out, \"any such risk\" is \"a risk \nof Venezuela 's own making, given its stout refusal to pay its lawful debt or cooperate in the \nOFAC licensing process.\" (D.I. 406 at 2; see also D.I. 421 at 10 (\"[I]fthe OFAC sanctions they \nseek depress the value of the shares, their own efforts will be the source of their asserted \ninjury.\")) \nAccordingly, the Special Master is directed to include in the final version of the Sale \nProcedures Order provisions setting out a Six-Month Window Trigger and a brief opportunity for \n43 the Sale Process Parties to object to whatever recommendation the Special Master makes \npursuant to such provisions. \nIV. The Court Is Inclined To Certify An Interlocutory Appeal \nThe Third Circuit's most recent opinion in this case does nothing to alter this Court's \nview that, for all the reasons explained throughout this Opinion, it can and should proceed with \nthe sale process to the maximum extent permissible under the current sanctions regime. \nHowever , the Third Circuit's recent opinion also suggests to the Court that it might now be an \nappropriate time to seek the Third Circuit's view on whether this Court's analysis of the \nsanctions is correct. In other words, it seems to the Court that it might be wise to certify one or \nmore questions to the Third Circuit for an interlocuto ry appeal. \nAs the Third Circuit observed in Crysta/lex II, \"OFAC's rule looms large in this case.\" \n24 F.4th at 247. While the Court of Appeals was expressly referencing 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.407 \n( discussed above), this Court also understand s the Third Circuit to be making a general \nobservation that the sanctions regime has enormous implications for how (and whether) this \nlitigation should proceed, and how the market is likely to react once a sale process is launched. \nHaving presided over this litigation and related cases for more than six years, see \ngenerally Crysta/lex Int'! Corp. v. Petr6leos de Venezuela, SA., C.A. No. 15-1082-LPS (D. Del.) \n(filed Nov. 23, 2015), the undersigned Judge believes that the most appropriate next step might \nbe to certify an interlocutory appeal, seeking appellate guidance as to the impact of the sanctions \nregime on the Court's ability to launch the sale process, as envisioned in this Opinion.35 This \n35 In a separate opinion being issued today in related actions, the Court is raising the \nsame suggestion of an interlocutory appeal relating to the impact of the sanctions regime on the \n44 Court has done its best to evaluate the parties' competing arguments and to explain its reasoning \nfor concluding that it has the authority, consistent with the sanctions, to adopt a Sale Procedures \nOrder and to implement that order to the point at which a winning bidder for the PDVH Shares is \nselected, while also not permitting execution of the sale until OF AC issues a license ( or the \nsanctions regime is materially changed). As explained above, the Court is prepared, subject to \nthe Six-Month Window Trigger provisions, to launch its sale procedures, perhaps before the end \nof 2022. Rather than doing so without knowing whether the Court of Appeals agrees with this \nCourt's analysis of the sanctions regime, it might be preferable -while the Six-Month Window \nperiod is running -to ask the Third Circuit to review this crucial legal issue. If the Court of \nAppeals disagrees with this Court, it could prevent this Court from undertaking a costly, \nunnecessary, and legally invalid sale process. Alternatively , if it agrees with this Court, the \nCourt of Appeals could provide greater comfort to market participants that this Court's process is \nlawful, thereby improving the chances of obtaining a fair value for the PDVH Shares to be sold. \nThe Court is not suggesting that today's decision constitutes a final judgment. As the \nThird Circuit has explained , \"a post-judgment order is final when it leaves nothing to be done in \nthe cause save to superintend, ministerially, the execution of the decree.\" Crystallex II, 24 F.4th \nat 255 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted); see also id. at 254-55 (\"Generally , the \ndispositive question, then, is whether there is anything left for the district court to do with respect \nto execution of the judgment.\") (internal quotation marks omitted)). This case has not reached \nsuch a stage; it is not even close. Nor does this Court wish to invite \"piecemeal review of every \nCourt's ability to authorize the issuance of writs of attachment to other judgment creditors of \nVenezuela or other entities of the Venezuelan government. See, e.g., OJ Eur. Grp. B. V v. \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Misc. No. 19-290-LPS D.I. 109 (D. Del. Mar. 2, 2022). \n45 post-judgment order en route to a final sale.\" Id. Instead, it welcomes the \"room to manage \ncomplex litigation \" that comes from the final judgment rule. Id. at 250. All that said, the Court \nperceives a possibility that this case (and the related litigation) may have reached a point at \nwhich a detour to the Court of Appeals would be beneficial to all involved. \nThe Court recognizes that just about six weeks ago, the Third Circuit explained: \n\"Venezuela 's assertion that a contingent auction would violate OFAC's regulations is ... unripe \nfor resolution in this appeal. We reject Venezuela 's attempt to inject this premature issue into \nthis appeal.\" Id. at 257 (citation omitted). Much has changed, however, in the intervening \ntime. Most importantly , when the Third Circuit issued its opinion, this Court \"ha[d] not \napproved a contingent auction,\" id., but now, in this Opinion, it has. When the Third Circuit \nissued Crystal/ex 11, it understood that this Court had not yet decided \"how far [it] can go toward \na final sale\" and rightly predicted that this Court would \"decide how far is too far in the \nforthcoming order on sale procedures. \" Id. at 258. Now, the Court has made these decisions , \nhaving exercised its \"judgment \" and resolved the \"legal objection[s]\" relating to the impact of \nthe sanctions. Id. at 255. While not constituting a final order, the Court's decision may well \nmake these important, formerly \"unripe\" issues no longer premature for appeal. \nAdditionally, unlike an appeal from a recalcitrant judgment debtor, which the Court of \nAppeals confronted in Crystal/ex 11, a certified interlocutory appeal would come with this \nCourt's backing. If the Court proceeds in this manner, it would, as required by 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1292(b), express in an order its view that \"such order involves a controlling question oflaw as \nto which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from \nthe order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" Such an order \n46 might then lead the Third Circuit to exercise its discretion to permit an interlocutory appeal. \nDuring such appeal, the proceedings in this Court, including the opening ( and potential closing) \nof the Six-Month Window, would not be stayed. \nThe Court is inclined to certify an interlocutory appeal. Before deciding whether to do \nso, the Court will solicit and carefully consider the views of the Special Master and the Sale \nProcess Parties on this point. \nCONCLUSION \nAs the Court noted at the outset of this Opinion, while all involved with this case have \nundertaken a tremendous amount of work to date, much additional work lies ahead. The \nimmediate next steps will include the Sale Process Parties -and the Special Master, if he wishes \n-providing their positions on whether the Court should certify an interlocutory appeal to the \nThird Circuit relating to the impact of the sanctions regime on the Court's ability to undertake a \nsale process (but not execute an actual sale) in the absence of a specific license from OF AC. \nThe Sale Process Parties and the Special Master will also be directed to attempt to resolve any \nremaining ripe objections to the Proposed Order that are not expressly resolved in this Opinion -\nand, in the event they cannot do so, to file briefs (preferably short briefs) to allow the Court to \nrule on any such objections. The Special Master will also be required to work with the Sale \nProcess Parties to prepare a version of the Proposed Sale Procedures Order consistent with the \nCourt's rulings in this Opinion and on any objections to be briefed, as just explained . \n47 Thereafter , the Court anticipates signing a version of the Proposed Order that is consistent with \ntoday's and any forthcoming decisions , thereby opening the Six-Month Window.36 \nAn appropriate Order follows. \n36 The Third Circuit further anticipates that \"[m]ore appeals will likely follow the final \norder on sale procedures.\" Crystallex II, 24 F.4th at 255. \n48 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCRYSTALLEX INTERNATIONAL \nCORPORATION , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA , \nDefendant. \nORDER Misc.
