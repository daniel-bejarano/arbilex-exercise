TIM BOULOS, et al.\n\nDefendants.\n\nRoger L. Dennis, Howard R. Young Cortectional Institution, Wilmington, Delaware. Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJune 13, 2022\nWilmington, Delawate\nturd P. bos\n\nST. US. Circuit Judge:\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Roger L. Dennis, an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in\nWilmington, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (DL. 2) Plaintiff appears pro\nse and has been gtanted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 4,7) The Court ptoceeds to screen\nthe Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A@a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\nEighth Amendment to the United States Constitution when he was housed at HRYCTI; excessive\nforce was used against him, he tested positive for COVID-19 on December 28, 2020, and the\nDepartment of Correction did not respond to his grievances. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages.\nIll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sva sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 US.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted, ot seeks monetaty telief from a defendant who is immune from\nsuch relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglo, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(\u20ac)(2) (i forma\npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and tale them in the light most\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff, See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nErickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally\nconstrued and the Complaint, \u201chowever inattfully pleaded, ssa be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\n1\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Willams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989); see\nalso Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d ot \u201cfantastic or\ndelusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d Dooley \u00bb. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d\n523, 530 (2003) and Neitke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a\nplaintiff leave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayniew\nState Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Be//_At Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do\nmore than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a\ncause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 165 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\nstate a claim to telief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306,\n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Asheroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).\n\n2\nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect\nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency\nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they ate no more than conclusions, ate not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume\ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See\nConnelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements ate sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to telief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task\nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial expetience and common sense.\u201d Id.\nIv. DISCUSSION\n\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, a prisoner must pursue all available\navenues for relief through the prison\u2019s grievance system before bringing a federal civil tights action.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 n.6 (2001) (\u201c[A]n inmate must exhaust\nirrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u201d). Section\n1997(e) provides that \u201c[nJo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section\n1983 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, or any other Federal law, by a ptisoner confined in\nany jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available ate\nexhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e). The exhaustion requirement is mandatory. See Williams v. Beard,\n482 F.3d 637, 639 (3d Cir. 2007); Booth, 532 U.S. at 742 (holding that exhaustion requirement of\nPLRA applies to grievance procedures \u201cregardless of the relief offered through administrative\n\n3\nprocedures\u201d). The limitations period for filing a \u00a7 1983 action is tolled during the period that a\nprisoner spends exhausting his administrative remedies. See Jones v. Unknown D.O.C. Bus Driver &\nTransportation Crew, 944 F.3d 478, 480 (3d Cir. 2019).\n\nThete is no futility exception to \u00a7 1997e\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See Nyhuis v. Reno, 204\nF.3d 65, 75-76 3d Cir. 2000). An inmate must fully satisfy the administrative requirements of the\ninmate grievance process before proceeding into federal court. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218 3d\nCir. 2004); see also Oriakhi v. United States, 165 F. App\u2019x 991, 993 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[T]here appears to\nbe unanimous circuit court consensus that a prisoner may not fulfill the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion\ntequitement by exhausting administrative remedies after the filing of the complaint in federal\ncourt.\u201d). Courts have concluded that inmates who fail to fully, or timely, complete the prison\ngtievance process ate batred from subsequently litigating claims in federal court. See \u00a2.g., Booth v.\nChurner, 206 F.3d 289 (3d Cit. 2000); Bolla v. Strickland, 304 F. App\u2019x 22 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nIf the actions of ptison officials directly caused the inmate\u2019s procedural default on a\ngtievance, the inmate will not be held to strict compliance with this exhaustion requirement. See\nCamp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279 (3d Cir. 2000). In addition, an inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust will be\nexcused \u201cunder certain limited circumstances,\u201d Harris v. Armstrong, 149 F. App\u2019x 58, 59 (3d Cir.\n2005), so an inmate can defeat a claim of failure to exhaust by showing \u201che was misled or that there\nwas some exttaordinary reason he was prevented from complying with the statutory mandate,\u201d Davis\nv. Warman, 49 F. App\u2019x 365, 368 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Ross v Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 642-44 (2016)\n(administrative procedure is not available when it operates as simple dead end, it is so opaque that it\nbecomes incapable of use, and when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of\ngtievance process through machination, misinterpretation, or intimidation.). Also, \u201cadministrative\nremedies are not \u2018available\u2019 under the PLRA where a prison official inhibits an inmate from resorting\n\n4\nto them through serious threats of retaliation and bodily harm.\u201d Rinaldi v. United States, 904 F.3d\n257, 267 (3d Cir. 2018).\n\nWhile exhaustion is an affirmative defense, the Court may swa sponte dismiss an action\npursuant to \u00a7 1915A when the failure to exhaust defense is obvious from the face of the complaint.\nSee Caiby v, Haidk, 785 F. App\u2019x 64, 65 (3d Cir. 2019). Here, Plaintiff admits that the grievance\nptocess was not complete when he filed his Complaint. (D.I. 2 at 9) He states that his grievances\nate being forwarded to the unit commander and it has been two months since he requested action.\n(id) Given Plaintiff's admission in the Complaint that the grievance process was not complete when\nhe filed this action, dismissal for failure to exhaust is warranted. The Complaint will be dismissed\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Coutt will dismiss the Complaint without prejudice pursuant to\n\n28 U'S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nROGER L. DENNIS,\na/k/a Abdul a.m. Shakur,\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nv. Civ. No. 21-655-LPS\n\nDR.

The Complaint is DISMISSED without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1915(\u20ac)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(1) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required under\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act.\n\n2. Plaintiff is given leave to file an amended complaint on those claims that are\nadministratively exhausted.
