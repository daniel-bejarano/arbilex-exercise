Attorney for Respondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nANDREWS, TE STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPetitioner Dwight L. Shivers, Jr. is an inmate in custody at the James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware. Petitioner filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas\nCorpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, followed by an amended Petition. (D.I. 2; D.I. 11) The\nState filed a Motion for Leave to File a Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 20), which the Court granted\nafter considering Petitioner\u2019s Response (D.I. 25). (See D.I. 29) The Court now grants the State\u2019s\nMotion to Dismiss (D.I. 30), and dismisses the Petitions as barred by the limitations period\nprescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.\n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\nIn October 2016, Petitioner stabbed his male and female roommates and then fled the\nscene in his female victim\u2019s car. (D.I. 19-10 at 6-7) Petitioner stabbed his female victim one\ntime and his male victim fifteen to twenty times. Both victims survived the attacks. Petitioner\nwas taken into custody after he arrived at the Maryland State Police barracks driving the female\nvictim\u2019s car. (Id.)\n\nIn January 2017, a Sussex County grand jury returned an indictment charging Petitioner\nwith attempted first degree murder, second degree assault, theft of a motor vehicle, and two\ncounts of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony (\u201c\u201cPDWDCF\u201d). (D.L\n19-1 at Entry No. 2) On August 25, 2017, Petitioner entered a \u201cRobinson\u201d plea to attempted first\ndegree murder and second degree assault, and the State dismissed the remaining three charges.\n(D.I. 19-1 at Entry No. 14; D.I. 19-2) The Superior Court immediately sentenced Petitioner to\nfifteen years of incarceration followed by decreasing levels of supervision. (See D.I. 19-10 at\n13-22) On August 31, 2017, the Superior Court corrected its sentence to add a no contact\n\nprovision. (D.I. 19-1 at Entry No. 15; see D.I. 19-10 at 18-22) Petitioner did not appeal.\nOn September 14, 2017, Petitioner filed a motion for modification of his sentence, which\nthe Superior Court denied on September 21, 2017. (D.I. 19-1 at Entry Nos. 16, 17) On October\n10, 2017, Petitioner filed his first motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior\nCourt Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d). (D.I. 19-3; see D.I. 19-1 at Entry No. 18) The\nSuperior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on December 20, 2017. (D.I. 19-5) Petitioner did not\nappeal.\n\nOn April 13, 2020, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion. (D.I. 19-6) The Superior\nCourt denied the second Rule 61 motion as successive under Rule 61(d)(2) on April 30, 2020.\n(D.I. 19-1 at Entry No. 27) Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the\nSuperior Court\u2019s judgment on June 4, 2021. See Shivers v. State, 253 A.3d 1048 (Table), 2021\nWL 2310361 (Del. Jun. 4, 2021).\n\nIn October 2021, Petitioner filed a Petition in this Court, and he filed an amended Petition\nin February 2022 (collectively referred to as \u201cPetition\u201d). (DL. 2; D.I. 11) The Petition asserts\nthree grounds for relief: (1) the Superior Court abused its discretion by not ordering a\ncompetency hearing or a pre-sentence investigation despite being aware of Petitioner\u2019s long\nhistory of mental health issues (D.I. 2 at 5; D.I. 11 at 6); (2) defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress Petitioner\u2019s statement to the police,\nwhich was made while he was under the influence of morphine (D.I. 2 at 7; D.L. 11 at 5); and (3)\ndefense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to investigate Petitioner\u2019s mental\nhealth issues and to request a competency hearing (D.I. 11 at 1-3) The State filed a Motion for\nLeave to File a Motion to Dismiss, to which Petitioner filed a Response. (D.I. 20; DI. 25) The\nCourt granted the State\u2019s Motion for Leave to File a Motion to Dismiss. (D.L 29) The Petition\nand the State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 30) are ready for review.\n\n2\n\nI. ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u2018AEDPA\u201d) prescribes a one-\n\nyear period of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which begins to run\nfrom the latest of:\n\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion\n\nof direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\n\nreview;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created\n\nby State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United\n\nStates is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such\n\nState action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable\n\nto cases on collateral review; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims\n\npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due\n\ndiligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling.\nSee Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\n(statutory tolling). A petitioner may also be excused from failing to comply with the limitations\nperiod by making a gateway showing of actual innocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4\" 133,\n151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual innocence exception).\n\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court cannot see, any facts triggering the application of\n\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D). Therefore, the one-year period of limitations began to run when\n\nPetitioner\u2019s conviction became final under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Pursuant to\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner does not appeal a state court judgment, the judgment of\nconviction becomes final, and the statute of limitations begins to run, upon \u201cthe expiration of the\n\n3\ntime for seeking [direct] review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); see Kapral v. United States, 166\nF.3d 565, 577 (3d Cir. 1999); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 Gd Cir. 1999). In this case,\nsince Petitioner did not file a direct appeal, his judgment of conviction became final on\nSeptember 25, 2017, the day on which the thirty-day appeal period expired.! Applying the one-\nyear limitations period to that date, Petitioner had until September 25, 2018, to timely file a\nhabeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 (3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)\napplies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D.\nDel. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is calculated according to the\nanniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the date it began to\nrun). Petitioner, however, did not file the instant Petition until October 21, 2021,\u201d approximately\nthree years after that deadline. Thus, the Petition is time-barred and should be dismissed, unless\nthe limitations period can be statutorily or equitably tolled, or Petitioner demonstrates a\nconvincing claim of actual innocence excusing his untimely filing. The Court will discuss each\n\ndoctrine in turn.\n\n'The thirty-day filing period actually expired on September 24, 2017, which was a Sunday.\nTherefore, the appeal period extended through the end of Monday, September 25, 2017. See Del.\nSupr. Ct. R. 11(a).\n\nPursuant to the prison mailbox rule, a pro se prisoner\u2019s habeas petition is deemed filed on the\ndate he delivers it to prison officials for mailing. See Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761\n(3d Cir. 2003) (the date on which a prisoner transmitted documents to prison authorities for\nmailing is to be considered the actual filing date). Here, the certificate of mailing in the Petition\nis dated October 21, 2021. (D.I. 2 at 15) Consequently, the Court adopts October 21, 2021 as\nthe date of filing.\nA. Statutory Tolling\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA\u2019s\nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post-\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). The\nlimitations period is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction\ndecision could be filed even if the appeal is not eventually filed. Jd. at 424. The limitations\nperiod, however, is not tolled during the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state post-\nconviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att\u2019y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\nThe limitations clock started to run on September 26, 2017,? and ran for fourteen days\nuntil Petitioner filed his first Rule 61 motion on October 10, 2017. The Superior Court denied\nthe Rule 61 motion on December 20, 2017, and Petitioner did not appeal that decision.\nTherefore, the Rule 61 motion tolled the limitations period from October 10, 2017 through\nJanuary 22, 2018,* which includes the thirty-day appeal period.\n\nThe limitations clock started to run again on January 23, 2018, and ran the remaining 351\ndays without interruption until the limitations expired on January 9, 2019. Petitioner\u2019s second\n\nRule 61 motion, filed on April 13, 2020, does not toll the limitations period because it was filed\n\n3Petitioner filed a motion for modification of sentence on September 14, 2017, which the\nSuperior Court denied on September 21, 2017, five days before the limitations period began to\n\nrun.\n\u2018The last day of the thirty-day appeal period fell on Saturday, January 20, 2018. Therefore, the\n\ntime to appeal extended through the end of the day on Monday, January 22, 2018. See Del. Sup.\nCt. R. 6(a)(iii).\n\u2018 5\nafter the limitations had expired. Accordingly, the instant Petition is time-barred, unless\nequitable tolling applies or Petitioner establishes a gateway claim of actual innocence.\n\nB. Equitable Tolling\n\nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare circumstances\nwhen the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that\nsome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560\nUSS. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the\nlate filing is due to the petitioner\u2019s excusable neglect. Jd. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary\ncircumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be\nextraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to\nmeeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011).\nAn extraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal\nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner\u2019s failure to\nfile a timely federal petition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013).\n\nPetitioner asserts that his mental illness constitutes an extraordinary circumstance\nwatranting equitable tolling. (See D.I. 25 at 2) He contends that he has been \u201ctaking psychiatric\nmedication as far back as the 3 grade\u201d and that his \u201cwell documented irreversible mental\ndisability is severe enough that [he] was not able to understand and comply with AEDPA\u2019s filing\nrequirements and deadline.\u201d (D.I. 25 at 2-3)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s argument is unavailing. \u201c[MJental incompetence is not a per se reason to toll\na statute of limitations. Rather, the alleged mental incompetence must somehow have affected\nthe petitioner's ability to file a timely habeas petition.\u201d Nara v. Frank, 264 F.3d 310, 320 (3d\nCir. 2001), overruled in part on other grounds by Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214 (2002).\n\n6\nAlthough Petitioner\u2019s medical records provide evidence of continuing mental illness, the records\ndemonstrate that Petitioner\u2019s mental health issues were not so severe that he would have been\nincapable of filing a timely habeas petition during the time period extending from the end of the\nstatutorily tolled time \u2014 January 2018 \u2014 to the date on which the limitations period expired in\nJanuary 2019. See, e.g., Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F.4\" 133, 145-47 (3d Cir. 2021) (focusing \u201con\nwhat the records show about the changes and fluctuations [of the petitioner\u2019s] condition over the\ndecade-plus period for which he seeks tolling\u201d to determine if petitioner\u2019s mental illness\nconstituted an extraordinary circumstance for equitable tolling purposes). In fact, Petitioner\u2019s\nmedical records indicate that, once he received medication for mental illness, he experienced\nsignificant periods of relative stability from December 2017 through at least November 2018.\n(D.I. 22-2 at 15-16, 22-23, 32-33, 38-39) Since Petitioner\u2019s medical records demonstrate that his\n\u201cmental condition was sufficiently stable to have allowed him to pursue his legal rights\u201d during\nthe relevant period, the Court concludes Petitioner\u2019s mental illness does not constitute an\nextraordinary circumstance triggering equitable tolling. Wallace, 2 F.4\" at 148.\n\nPetitioner does not assert that any other extraordinary circumstance prevented him from\ntimely filing a habeas petition. To the extent Petitioner\u2019s late filing was due to a mistake or\nmiscalculation of the one-year filing period, such a mistake does not warrant equitably tolling the\nlimitations period. See Taylor v. Carroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May 14, 2004).\n\nGiven these circumstances, the Court concludes that the doctrine of equitable tolling is\nnot available to Petitioner on the facts he has presented.\n\nC. Actual Innocence\n\nA credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that can\novercome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. See McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S\n\n7\n383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F 4th at 150-51. A petitioner satisfies the actual innocence\nexception by (1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his innocence; and (2) showing \u201cby a\npreponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201ca reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his\nguilt[] in light of the new evidence.\u201d Jd. at 151.\n\nIn this case, Petitioner does not allege that he is actually innocent. To the extent the Court\nshould construe Petitioner's argument that he was mentally ill at the time of his plea colloquy as\nan attempt to trigger the actual-innocence equitable exception to AEDPA's limitations period, his\nattempt is unavailing. Courts that have considered the issue have found that a petitioner's\nallegation of incompetency to enter a guilty plea does not state a claim of actual innocence for\npurposes of the actual innocence gateway exception, because a petitioner's mental state at the\ntime of a guilty plea does not bear on his mental state at the time of the crime. See Williams v.\nCovello, 2021 WL 6551280, at *7 n. 7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2021) (collecting cases). Therefore,\nthe Court concludes that Petitioner has not presented a gateway claim of actual innocence\nsufficient to excuse his untimely filing.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will grant the State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Petition\nIl. REQUEST FOR COUNSEL\n\nIn his Response to the State\u2019s Motion for Leave to File a Motion to Dismiss, Petitioner\nasks the Court to appoint counsel to \u201cinvestigate [Petitioner\u2019s] mental condition and explore the\ncontents of prior counsel\u2019s file and formulate an explanation for delay that might provide a basis\nfor equitable tolling.\u201d (D.I. 25 at 4) Having determined that Petitioner\u2019s mental health issues do\n\nnot trigger equitable tolling, the Court will dismiss Petitioner\u2019s request for counsel as moot.\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nWhen a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the\nunderlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability\nunless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the\npetition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was\ncorrect in its procedural ruling. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court concludes that the instant Petition is time-barred. In the Court\u2019s view,\nreasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Therefore, the Court will not\nissue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the instant Petition as time-barred without\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing or issuing a certificate of appealability. An appropriate Order\n\nwill be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nDWIGHT L.
