Background. Plaintiff is a flower delivery company offering nationwide floral\ndelivery through three floral networks. (D.I. 1 at ] 8) To provide flower delivery services,\nPlaintiff receives orders through its website and obtains flowers from various affiliates. (/d.)\nPlaintiff's business has a strong focus on customer service due to the perishable nature of its\nproduct, and Plaintiff maintains refund and replacement policies to ensure customer satisfaction.\n(Ud. at] 10) Plaintiff asserts the following facts in its complaint and motion. (D.I. 1; D.I. 5) The\ncourt accepts the averments as true for purposes of the pending motion, without making any\nfindings of fact.\n\n2. Defendant is an anonymous individual who runs the Facebook page \u201cAvas\nFlowers \u2014 Scam,\u201d which publishes statements accusing Plaintiff of defrauding its customers and\nallows Facebook users to publicly post comments regarding their customer experiences with\n\nPlaintiff. (D.I. 1 at ff 11-14; D.I. 5, Ex. A at 7) The Facebook page has been operational since\n2015 or 2016. (D.I. 1 at 11) Since that time, Defendant has encouraged commenters on the\nFacebook page to file formal complaints with the New Jersey Attorney General and to dispute\ncredit card charges from Plaintiff's business.\n\n3. Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit on July 9, 2021, asserting claims for defamation\nagainst Defendant, an anonymous individual who allegedly runs the Facebook page \u201cAvas\nFlowers -- Scam.\u201d (D.I. 1) The following month, Plaintiff filed a motion to subpoena Facebook\nin an effort to discover Defendant\u2019s identity. (D.I. 3) The court denied the motion without\nprejudice, finding that Plaintiff had not exhausted other means of identifying Defendant. (D.I. 4)\n\n4. Plaintiff filed the Amended Motion on August 31, 2021, less than two weeks after\nthe court denied the original motion. (D.I. 5) In the Amended Motion, Plaintiff asserts that the\ninformation sought will likely include an Internet Protocol address (\u201cIP address\u201d) that may either\ndirectly identify Defendant or, alternatively, trace to an Internet Service Provider (\u201cISP\u201d) who\ncan identify Defendant. (/d. at 3) Plaintiff also seeks leave to issue a subpoena to Defendant\u2019s\nemail provider in the event that the discovery reveals Defendant\u2019s email address. (Jd.)\n\n5. Legal Standard. \u201cA party may not seek discovery from any source before the\nparties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f), except . . . when authorized by these rules, by\nstipulation, or by court order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). Courts have broad discretion to manage\nthe discovery process, and can expedite or otherwise alter the timing and sequence of discovery.\nSee id.; see also Bank v. Doe, 2021 WL 2548990, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2021); Kone Corp. v.\nThyssenKrupp USA, Inc., C.A. No. 11-465-LPS-CJB, 2011 WL 4478477, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 26,\n2011). This discretion extends to the timing of service of a third-party subpoena under Rule 45.\n\nSee Dish Network L.L.C. v. Motasaki, 2020 WL 10786543, at *1 (S.D. Tex. June 26, 2020).\n6. Courts in this district have applied the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard in cases \u201cwhere\nexpedited discovery is sought in order to identify unknown or anonymous John Doe defendants.\u201d\nReybold Grp. of Cos., Inc. v. Does 1-20, 323 F.R.D. 205, 208 (D. Del. 2017); see Strike 3\nHoldings, LLC v. Doe, C.A. No. 18-895-LPS, 2018 WL 5024168, at *1 (D. Del. Oct. 17, 2018);\nVision Films, Inc. v. John Does 1-24, C.A. No. 12-1746-LPS-SRF, 2013 WL 1163988, at *4 (D.\nDel. Mar. 20, 2013). In the context of an ex parte motion for discovery, \u201c[g]ood cause may be\nfound where the need for expedited discovery, in consideration of the administration of justice,\noutweighs the prejudice to the responding party.\u201d Semitool, Inc. v. Tokyo Electron Am., Inc., 208\nF.R.D. 273, 276 (N.D. Cal. 2002). The court considers a non-exclusive list of three factors to\ndetermine whether good cause exists: \u201c(1) whether Plaintiff has established a prima facie\nshowing of [the asserted claim]; (2) whether Plaintiff \u2018has no other way to identify the alleged\nwrongdoers, aside from obtaining the discovery at issue;\u2019 and (3) whether \u2018expedited discovery\nis necessary because evidence identifying the defendants may otherwise be destroyed (e.g., as a\nresult of routine deletion by third party ISPs).\u201d\u201d Strike 3, 2018 WL 5024168, at *1 (quoting\nReybold, 323 F.R.D. at 208).\n\n7. Analysis. Plaintiff has not shown good cause to serve a third-party subpoena on\nFacebook, Inc. under the second factor because it has not remedied the deficiencies identified by\nthe court following the denial of its first motion for leave to serve a subpoena. In denying\nPlaintiffs original motion, the court explained it was \u201cnot convinced that Plaintiff has exhausted\nother means of identifying the individual (or information that could assist in identifying the\nindividual),\u201d citing case law in which the plaintiff hired a private investigator to determine the IP\naddresses of alleged copyright infringers. (D.I. 4 (citing Strike 3 Holdings, 2018 WL 5024168)).\n\nThe court indicated that Plaintiff could \u201crefile its motion with a recitation of the additional\nefforts and a showing of why Plaintiff has \u2018no other way\u2019 to identify Doe without the requested\nsubpoena.\u201d (D.I. 4)\n\n8. In the Amended Motion, Plaintiff fails to recite what additional efforts, if any, it\nhas employed to identify Defendant. Plaintiff has made no showing of why it has \u201cno other\nway\u201d to identify Defendant without the requested subpoena. Judge Noreika provided Plaintiff\nwith an example from the Strike 3 case wherein the plaintiff hired private investigators to\ndetermine the IP addresses of alleged copyright infringers. (D_I. 4 (citing Strike 3 Holdings,\n2018 WL 5024168, at *1)). Similarly, in Vision Films the plaintiff engaged a computer forensic\nvendor to identify alleged infringers who were using an online media distribution system to copy\nand share files of a copyrighted motion picture. See Vision Films, 2013 WL 1163988, at *1-2.\nThe vendor used publicly available databases to trace the identified IP addresses to general\ngeographic areas purportedly within Delaware. Jd.\n\n9. Here, Plaintiff does not explain how it has complied with the court\u2019s order dated\nAugust 19, 2021. (D.I. 4) There is no indication that it hired a private investigator or a vendor\nwith expertise in computer forensics to identify Defendant. Plaintiff provides no report or\ndeclaration from an investigator confirming there is no way to identify Defendant\u2019s IP address\nfrom any publicly available databases or forensic techniques, or that Facebook exclusively\ncontrols the identifying information. Instead, Plaintiff recites in conclusory fashion that it has\nmade reasonable efforts to obtain more information, without describing any steps it has taken to\nidentify the alleged wrongdoer short of seeking a third-party subpoena.\n\n10. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Amended Ex Parte Motion for\nLeave to Subpoena Facebook, Inc. and Related Third Parties is DENIED without prejudice.\n\n(D.I. 5) In the event Plaintiff renews its motion for ex parte discovery, Plaintiff shall provide a\ndetailed description of the additional efforts it has made to identify Defendant and explain why\n\u201cno other way\u201d exists to identify Defendant without the requested subpoena.\n\n11. | This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed.
