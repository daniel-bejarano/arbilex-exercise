No. 21-1124- RGA  \n       \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nPending before the Court is Defendant \u2019s Motion to Dismiss or Stay and Compel Arbitration \n(D.I. 30).  I heard oral argument on December 21, 2022.  As announced from the  bench , I \nrecommend  that Defendant \u2019s motion be  GRANTED and that the case be stayed pending \narbitration.   \nI. DISCUSSION  \nMy report and recommendation on Defendant \u2019s motion  was announced from the bench at \nthe conclusion of the hearing as follows:  \nI\u2019m prepared to give my report and recommendation on \nDefendant \u2019s motion to dismiss  or to stay and compel arbitration. \n(D.I. 30.)  I want to emphasize before I announce my recommendation  that while I \u2019m not issuing a separate written \nopinion, we have followed a full and thorough process for resolving \nthe pending motion.  The motion was fully briefed on both sides .  I \nalso heard oral argument today.  Everything submitted and argued \nhas been carefully considered.  If I do not mention a particular \nargument or case cited by a party , it\u2019s not because I did not consider \nit.  I will refer only to the cases and arguments raised by the parties \nto the extent necessary to resolve the pending motion.  For the reasons I \u2019m about to state , I recommend granting Defendant \u2019s \nrequest to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration.  \n 2 \n I assume the following facts alleged in the complaint to be \ntrue for the purpose of resolving the pending motion.  Defendant \nCenter for Excellence in Higher Educatio n, Inc. is a Delaware \ncorporation with headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah .  (D.I. 1 \u00b6 8.)  \nPlaintiff Tyson  Romero worked for Defendant  at its head quarters  \nfor seven years.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.)  On or  about August 2, 2021, \nDefendant terminated  Plaintiff and about 300 other employees from  \nits Salt Lake City and P hoenix locations  without notice.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 1, \n2, 7, 11.)  On the same day , Plaintiff  filed his complaint in this \naction.   Plaintiff \u2019s complaint is styled , \u201cClass A ction  Complaint for \nViolation o f WARN  Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101, et seq.\u201d  In it, Plaintiff  \npurports to be bringing an action on  behalf of himself and a class of  \nsimilarly  situated former employees for monetary relief under  the \nWARN Act .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 23\u201333.)   \n \n\u201cThe purpose of the WARN Act is to protect workers by \nobligating employers to give their employees advance [] notice of \nmass layoffs or plant  closings .\u201d 0F1  In general terms, it says that \ncovered employers must provide 60 days advance written notice of \na mass layoff or plant  closing to each affected employee or their \nunion representative and to the state and local  government. 1F2  Section  \n2104(a)(1) says that  employers are liable to each aggrieved \nemployee  for back pay and benefits for each day notice  is not \nprovided, up to a maximum of 60 days. 2F3  Section  2104(a)(3)  says \nthat employers are subject to civil penalties for failure to provide \nnotice to a local government. 3F4  Section 2104(a)(5)  specifies  who \nmay bring a n enforcement suit and where they may bring it : it \nprovides that \u201c[ a] person seeking to enforce such liability , including \na representative of  employees or a unit of local government  \naggrieved under paragraph ( 1) or (3), may sue either  for such person \nor for other persons similarly situated , or both, in any district court \nof the  United States for any district in which the  violation is alleged \nto have occurred, or in  which the employer transacts business. \u201d 4F5  \n \n1 In re APA Transp. Corp. Consol. Litig., 541 F.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir. 2008), as amended \n(Oct. 27, 2008).  \n \n2 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(a).   \n \n3 Id. \u00a7 2104(a)(1).   \n \n4 Id. \u00a7 2104(a)(3).   \n \n5 Id. \u00a7 2104(a)(5).   3 \n The term \u201crepresentative \u201d is defined elsewhere in the act and refers \nto labor organizations , i.e., union representatives. 5F6    \n \nPlaintiff \u2019s complaint  refers to [Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure]  23 and expressly requests certification of a class made \nup of employees that were terminated by Defendant  within 90 days \nof August 2, 2021.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13 \u201322.)   Defendant has not yet served \na responsive pleading.  On January 6, 2022, the parties jointly  \nrequested a stay so that they could pursue mediation.  (D.I. 14.)  The \nparties weren \u2019t able to resolve the case through mediation, and the \nCourt lifted the stay on August 2, 2022.  (D.I. 26.)  \n \nOn August 17, 2022, Defendant  filed the pending motion,  \nwhich seeks to stay or dismiss  the case so the parties can pursue \nresolution of this dispute in arbitration.  (D.I. 30.)  Defendant  \nsubmitted with its motion a copy of a two -page \u201cMediation and \nArbitration Agreement \u201d signed by Pl aintiff  when he started working \nfor Defendant  in 2014.  That document is set forth a s Exhibit A to \nD.I. 32, and I will refer to it as the \u201c Agreement.\u201d   \n \nThe Agreement outlines a three- step dispute resolution \nprocedure that , by its terms , applies to \u201c any and all disputes , \nconflicts , problems , controversies , or claims of any kind without \nexception arising from or connected to employment with the \nCompany.\u201d   (D.I. 32, Ex. A.)  In the first step , the employee must \ntake his complaint internally up the chain of command at the \ncompany.  (Id.)  In the second step , the parties must attempt \nresolution of the dispute in mediation.  ( Id.) \n \nDefendant \u2019s motion concerns the A greement \u2019s third step.  \nThe A greement states the following , in pertinent part : \n \nStep  Three:  Any and all disputes , conflicts , \nproblems , controversies , or claims of any kind \narising from or connected to employment with the Company, shall be submitted  to binding arbitration \nunder the substantive and procedural requirements of the Federal Arbitration Act , under the rules of the \nAmerican Arbitration Association . . . . All \ndeterminations as to the scope , enforceability  and \neffect of this arbitration agree ment shall be decided \nby the arbitrator , and not by a  Court. . . .  \n \n6 Id. \u00a7 2101(a)(4); see also United Food & Com. Workers Union Loc. 751 v. Brown Grp., \nInc., 517 U.S. 544, 548 (1996); In re APA Transp., 541 F.3d at 240.  4 \n Any dispute or claim shall be brought solely in that \nparty \u2019s individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or \nclass member in any purported class action, \nrepresentative proceeding, mass actio n or \nconsolidated action . \n \n(Id.) \n \nDefendant  contends , and Plaintiff  has not disputed, that the \nCourt should review the motion to compel arbitration under the same standard applicable to motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).   \nDefendant  also contends , and Plaintiff  has not disputed, that the \ncopy of the A greement submitted to the Court is  authentic and that \nthe Court may properly consider it.  Because Plaintiff  has not put \nthe Agreement to arbitrate at issue , nor has Plaintiff  identified any \nother disputed facts relative to the disposition of Defendant \u2019s \nmotion , the Court will proceed to a ssess it under the 12(b)(6) \nstandard.\n6F7   \n \n\u201cThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)  reflects the \u2018national \npolicy favoring arbitration and places arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.\u2019 \u201d\n7F8  Its primary substantive \nprovision says that \u201c[ a] written provision in . . . a contract evidencing \na transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy arising out of such contract  . . . shall be valid , \nirrevocable,  and enforceable , save upon such grounds as exist at law \nor equity for the revocation of any contract  . . . .\u201d\n8F9   It requires that \nthe Court , \u201cupon being satisfied\u201d  that an issue involved in the suit \nor proceeding is referable to arbitration under an arbitration agreement , \u201cshall on application of one of the parties sta y the  trial \nof the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the a greement. \u201d\n9F10  It also authorize s courts to issue \n \n7 See, e.g., Parker v. Briad Wenco, LLC, No. 18- 04860, 2019 WL 2521537, at *5 (E.D. Pa. \nMay 14, 2019) (\u201cIf a party attaches an authentic arbitration agreement in its motion to compel, the Court must apply the Rule 12(b)(6) standard unless the plaintiff responds to a motion to compel arbitration with additional facts sufficient to place the agreement to arbitrate in issue.\u201d (cleaned up)), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 2516059 (E.D. Pa. June 18, 2019) . \n \n8 In re Remicade (Direct Purchaser) Antitrust Litig. , 938 F.3d 515, 519 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 443 (2006)).  \n \n9 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.   \n \n10 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3.   5 \n orders compelling arbitration when one party has failed to com ply \nwith an  arbitration agreement. 10F11   \n \nTo determine whether [] an issue in a suit or proceeding is  \nreferable to arbitration within the meaning of \u00a7 2, courts \u201cmust \nconsider two gateway questions : (1) whether the parties have a valid \narbitration agreement at all ( i.e., its enforceability ), and (2) whether  \na concededly  binding arbitration clause applies to  a certain type of \ncontroversy ( i.e., its scope ).\u201d 11F12  \n \nDefendant  argues , and Plaintiff  does not dispute , that the \nAgreement is a valid arbitration agreement at least  as to some \ndisputes that may arise between the parties.   Defendant  further \npoints out , and Plaintiff  agreed during the argument today, that to \nthe extent that Plaintiff  has an individual WARN  claim , such a claim \nfalls within the scope of the A greement. 12F13  What \u2019s more , Plaintiff  \nacknowledged in his brief that the A greement has an express \nclass/representative action waiver and that class action waivers are \ngenerally enforceable, even for federal statut ory claims .  (D.I. 37 at \n8, 16.)  In other words , Plaintiff  recognizes that the plain terms of \nthe Agreement prevent him from pursuing a class arbitration of his \nand similarly situated employees \u2019 individual WARN  claims . \n \nIn light of all that, Defendant  says this case should be stayed \nso that arbitration can be had in accordance with  the terms of the \nAgreement.  I agree.  That outcome  should have been simple to \nreach.  Unfortunately, untangl ing Plaintiff \u2019s arguments against \nsending the case to a rbitration wasn \u2019t so simple.  I\u2019ll briefly \nsummarize what they are and my responses to them.  \n \nPlaintiff \u2019s main argument is that the arbitration a greement is \nunenforceable with respect to his WARN  Act claim because it \noperates  as a \u201c waiver \u201d of a substantive remedy.  (D.I. 37 at 2, 6\u20138.)  \nThe argument goes like this .  First, Plaintiff  says that , \nnotwithstanding the express reference to a class action and Rule 23 in his complaint he is not trying to bring a class action made up of individual employee claims under the WARN  Act.  According to \n \n11 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4.   \n \n12 Remicade,  938 F.3d at 519 ( cleaned up ). \n \n13 Defendant accurately points out, however, that even if there were  a dispute as to whether \nthe scope of the Agreement covered an individual WARN claim, that dispute should be resolved by the arbitrator, as the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.  ( See D.I. 32, Ex. A ( \u201cAll \ndeterminations as to the scope, enforceability and effect of this arbitration agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator, and not by a court.\u201d ).)   6 \n Plaintiff , what he is actually intending to bring is a  \u201crepresentative \naction .\u201d  (See D.I. 37 at 8.)   Plaintiff  says that his right to bring a \nrepresentative action is provided by 29 U.S.C.  \u00a7 2104(a)(5), which , \nas a reminder, says that a person seeking to enforce such liability\u2014\ni.e., the liability to employees for backpay and benefits under  \nparagraph (1) or liability to the local government under paragraph \n(3)\u2014including a representative of employees or a unit of local  \ngovernment aggrieved under paragraph (1) or (3), may sue either for  \nsuch person or for other persons similarly situated, or both, in federal \ncourt. 13F14  Plaintiff  concedes that the reference to a representative in \nthat paragraph refers only to the union (D.I. 37 at 2) , and Plaintiff  \ndoes not argue  that he is acting for the union.  Instead , Plaintiff  \nfocuses on the statutory language that permits an individual employee to sue for either \u201c such person  or for other persons \nsimilarly situated \u201d as the source of his alleged substantive right to \nbring a re presentative action.  \n \nPlaintiff  then cites the Supreme Court \u2019s opinion in Viking \nRiver Cruises, and other cases , for the proposition that the FAA  does \nnot require a court  to enforce a provision in an arbitration agreement \nthat operates as a waiver of a substantive right provided by a \nstatute .\n14F15  And because everyone agrees that the A greement \nexpressly prohibits Plaintiff  from pursuing class /representative \naction  claims in arbitration , Plaintiff  argues  that it operates as a \nwaiv er of his substantive right to bring a representative claim and \nshould not be enforced.  \n \nI reject that argument , for many reasons . For one thing, as \nDefendant  points out , the parties \u2019 Agreement delegates all disputes \nover the enforceability of the Agreement to the arbitrator. 15F16  To be \nclear , while Plaintiff  has raised challenges to the enforceability of \nthe class/representative action waiver in the Agreement , Plaintiff  \nhas never specifically challenged the validity of the parties \u2019 \nagreement to delegate arbitrability to the  arbitrator , nor has he \npersuasively explained why the Court should not enforce the parties \u2019 \nexpress agreement to arbitrate any disputes the  parties h ave over the \n \n14 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104(a)(5).   \n \n15 See, e.g., Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, 142 S. Ct. 1906, 1919, 1924 (2022).  \n \n16 See Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC v. Scout Petroleum, LLC , 809 F.3d 746, 753 (3d Cir. \n2016) (explaining that the presumption that courts should determine arbitrability can be overcome with \u201cexpress contractual language unambiguously delegating the question of arbitrability to the \narbitrator\u201d); Puleo v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., 605 F.3d 172, 187 (3d Cir. 2010) (acknowledging \nthat parties can contract to \u201c arbitrate arbitrability \u201d).    7 \n enforceability of the A greement , which would seem to include their \ndispute over the enforceability of the class/representative action \nwaiver. 16F17  That alone is enough to grant Defendant \u2019s motion and \nsend the case to arbitration. 17F18   \n But even if this  Court  did consider Plaintiff \u2019s contention that \nthe class/representative action waiver is unenforceable because it operates as a prospective waiver of a right to pursue a statutory  \nremedy , he cited no support for the proposition that \u00a7 2104(a)( 5) \nprovides a substantive remedy to an employee that is different than an employee \u2019s right to an individual remedy under \u00a7 2104(a)(1) .  \nSection 2 104(a)(5) merely says the plaintiff can enforce his and \nother individual employees \u2019 rights to such remedy provi ded by \n\u00a7 2104(a)(1) by suing on behalf of himself  and other employees .  It \ndoes not alter  the nature of the i ndividual plaintiff \u2019s substantive \nremedy under the statute , which is merely to recover the back pay \nand benefits owed to him under \u00a7 2104(a)(1).  \n \nPlaintiff suggest s that the  Supreme Court \u2019s decision in \nViking River Cruises  supports his argument that \u00a7 2104(a)(5)  gives \nhim a substantive  right to bring a representative claim , but that case \nis inapposite  for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that \nthe California state statute at issue there created a type of qui tam  \naction that allowed an employee plaintiff to sue as an agent or proxy  \nof the state , and the code provisions e nforced  through the statute \nestablished public duties  that were owed to the state, not private \nrights  belonging to employees in their individual  capacities .\n1 8F19    \nSection 2104(a)(5) bears no  resemblance to the representative claim \nprovision in Viking River .  Section 2104(a)(5) merely permits  an \nindividual plaintiff to pursue  a class/ representative action  to assert \nhis and other employees \u2019 individual  rights to the statutory remedies \nprovided in \u00a7 2104(a)(1).   \n \nFurther supporting my conclusion that \u00a7 2104(a)(5) does not  \nprovide a non- waiv able substantive right to some  type of \nrepresentative action is the fact that  its reference to actions for or on \n \n17 Under the FAA, a delegation provision is itself  \u201can additional, antecedent [arbitration] \nagreement ,\u201d and the FAA \u201c operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does any \nother .\u201d   Rent -A-Ctr., W., Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 70 (2010).   \n \n18 Id. at 72 (holding that when a litigant challenges the enforceability of an arbitration \nagreement with a delegation clause, the challenge must be submitted to the arbitrator  unless  the \nplaintiff has lodged a specific objection to the delegation clause  itself ). \n \n19 142 S. Ct. at 1914\u201315.  8 \n behalf of  others similarly situated is similar to the  portion of the A ge \nDiscrimination and  Employment A ct (\u201cADEA \u201d) that expressly \npermits  collective actions , and the Supreme Court has held that the \nright to bring a collective  action under ADEA  is a procedural right \nthat can  be waived in an arb itration agreement. 19F20   \n \nDuring oral argument today, Plaintiff  suggested that  the \nWARN  Act gave him a right to sue on behalf  of other individuals , \nwhich distinguishes it from the collective action procedure set forth \nin ADEA where  plaintiffs are required to opt in.  Maybe so , but that \ndoes not mean that the WARN  Act creates a substantive right .  \nPlaintiff still hasn \u2019t explained how the WARN Act \u2019s reference to \nsome type of representative action creates a substantive right as opposed to a procedural right , nor has  he provided any authority \nsuggesting that it is substantive.  A nd I don\u2019 t think it is .  The class \naction procedure set forth in Rule 23 talks about suing \u201c on behalf \nof\u201d members of a class , and that is a procedural right that can be \nwaived in an arbitration agreement.\n20F21 \n \nPlaintiff next suggest s that requiring employees to litigate \ntheir WARN  act claims individually would contravene the policies \nbehind the WARN  Act.  P laintiff points out that the Act \ncontemplates it will be  primarily enforced by employees and that it \nis not economically feasible for employees  to litigate their claims \nindividually.  T he problem with that argument is that federal \nstatutory claims are subject to the FAA , which requires enforcement \nof arbitration agreements , including class action waivers , unless the \nFAA \u2019s man date has been overridden by a contrary congressional  \ncomman d.  There is no such contrary congressional command here. \nPlaintiff contends that the \u201c native substantive statute \u201d (by which I \nassume he means \u00a7 2104(a)(5)) evinces  a congressional intent to \npreclude a waiver of class or representative action procedures.  I \ndisagree.  As already pointed out, \u00a7 2104(a)(5) contains text similar to the collective action provision in the ADEA, and the law is clear \n \n20 Compare  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104(a)(5) (WARN) ( \u201c[A] person seeking to enforce such liability \n. . . may sue either for such person or for other persons similarly situated\u201d ) with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) \n(ADEA) ( \u201cAn action to recover the liability prescribed in the preceding sentences may be \nmaintained . . . by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated. \u201d); see Am. Exp. Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 237 (2013) \n(\u201cIn Gilmer [v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 31\u201332 (1991)], we had no qualms in \nenforcing a class waiver in an arbitration agreement even though the federal statute at issue, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, expressly permitted collective actions. \u201d).   \n \n21 Italian Colors , 570 U.S. at 234 (\u201cNor does congressional approval of Rule 23 establish \nan entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of statutory rights.\u201d).  9 \n that the right to bring a collective action under  ADEA can be waived \nin an arbitration agreement.  \n \nTo conclude , I agree with Defendant  that the case is going to \narbitration .  If Defendant  is right that  the parties agreed to arbitrate \nthe enforceability of the class /representative action waiver , this case \nis going to arbitration.  But even if Plaintiff  is right that the Court \nshould assess the enforceability  of the class /representative action  \nwaiver,  this is going to arbitration because I would reject  Plaintiff \u2019s \nargument  that the waiver is unenforceable.  \n \nLastly , I will address Plaintiff \u2019s argument that Defendant  \nwaived his right to enforce the arbitration agreement altogether. 21F22  \nAccording to the Supreme Court in its recent case Morgan v . \nSundance , Inc., waiver \u201c\u2018is the intentional relinquishment or \nabandonment of a known right .\u2019\u201d 22F23  \u201cTo decide whether waiver has \noccurred , the court focuses on the actions of the person who held the \nright.\u201d 23F24  Sundance  abrogated the Third Circuit \u2019s longstanding  \nHoxworth test for assessing  whether a party waived its right [to \narbitrate]  by engaging in the litigation before switching course and \nasking for arbitration. 24F25   \n \nThis case is not an appropriate occasion to engage in the \nphilosophical exercise of figuring out how much of Hoxworth \nsurvived Sundance  because there is no basis on this record to \nconclude that Defendant  has acted  inconsistent with its right to have \nthe dispute resolved in arbitration as opposed to court.  Plaintiff  filed \nhis complaint in August 2021.  Defendant  has never answered the \ncomplaint.   In January 2022, the parties filed a joint motion to stay \nproceedings , and that motion expressly stated that \u201c[ p]rior to the \ncommencement of this litigation , Plaintiff  had executed a Mediation  \nand Arbitration Agreement with Defendant , which , Defendant  \n \n22 As a footnote, neither side argues that the question of waiver was delegated  to the \narbitrator.  Accordingly, I will address it.  Cf.  Ehleiter v. Grapetree Shores, Inc., 482 F.3d 207, \n217 (3d Cir. 2007) (observing that \u201c our Court has long decided questions of waiver based on \nlitigation conduct instead of referring the issue to an arbitrator \u201d). \n \n23 142 S. Ct. 1708, 1713 (2022)  (quoti ng United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993) ). \n  \n24 Id. \n  \n25 Compare Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., Inc., 980 F.2d 912, 925 (3d Cir. 1992) \n(\u201c[P]rejudice is the touchstone for determining whether the right to arbitrate has been waived \n. . . .\u201d ) with Sundance , 142 S. Ct. at 1714 ( \u201c[T]he usual federal rule of waiver does not include a \nprejudice requirement , [and] prejudice is not a condition of finding that a party, by litigating too \nlong, waived its right to stay litigation or compel ar bitration under the FAA. \u201d).   10 \n contends , precludes Plaintiff \u2019s litigation of his claims against \nDefendant  before this Court at this time. \u201d  (D.I. 14 \u00b6 1.)  The parties \nthen proceeded with mediation (D.I. 21, 23, 25) , which was not \ninconsistent with the A greement , as it required the parties to attempt \nmediation before going to arbitration .  The Court lifted the stay on \nAugust 2, 2022, and Defendant  filed its  motion  to compel two weeks \nlater.  (D.I. 26, 30.)  Plaintiff \u2019s contention that Defendant  waived its \nright to arbitration through litigation conduct is meritless .  \n \nIn the  section of his brief dealing with waiver , Plaintiff  says \nhe is concerned about Defendant \u2019s ability and intention to pay \narbitration fees , and he requests discovery into Defendant \u2019s finances \nand/or an order requiring Defendant  to post  bond with the Court .  \nPlaintiff  has cited no authority supporting either of those requests , \nand they should be denied.  The parties contracted to have their \ndisputes  resolved in arbitration, and the FAA requires the Court to \nstay the case and send the parties to arbitration.   \nII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Defendant s\u2019 motion (D.I. 30) be \nGRANTED and that  the case be stayed  pending arbitra tion.  \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limited to \nten pages.  Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten pages. \nThe failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.    11 The parties a re directed to the Court \u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed.
