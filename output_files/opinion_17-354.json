The Court presided over a three -day jury trial from June 30, 2021 to July 2, 2021.  ( See \nD.I. 128, 129 & 130).  At the end, t he jury found that Defendant Paul DeVilbiss was an employer \nunder the FLSA  and that he and Defendant DeVilbiss Landscape Architects, Inc. d/b/a  DeVilbiss \nLandscape Architects  (\u201cDeVilbiss Landscape\u201d) (collectively , \u201cDefendants\u201d) were liable for unpaid \novertime  to a number of employees because the agricultural exemption provided by the FLSA  did \nnot apply.  Presently before the Court are Defendants \u2019 renewed motion  for judgment as a matter \nof law (D.I. 133)  and motion to alter  or amend  the judgment (D.I. 135), as well as Plaintiff \u2019s motion \nto amend  the judgment (D.I. 131).  For the reasons set forth below, the Court will DENY  \nDefendants\u2019 motions  for judgment as a matter of law  and to alter or amend the judgment , and the \nCourt will GRANT -IN-PART and DENY- IN-PART  Plaintiff \u2019s motion to amend the  judgment . \nI. BACKGROUND \nSubject to certain exceptions, t he FLSA requires employers to pay overtime to employee s \nwho work more than forty hours in any given workweek.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207; see also  id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 216(b) & (c) ( providing private cause of action for overtime pay violations, as well as Secretary \ncause of action  for the same).  Plaintiff , Secretary of Labor  for the  United States Department of \nLabor (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cthe Secretary\u201d) , filed this case against Defendants  for violations of the \novertime pay requirements of the FLSA .1  (See generally  D.I. 1).  In particular, Plaintiff sought  \nunpaid overtime wages  owed to ten  employees of DeVilbiss Landscape.   Plaintiff alleged that, \nfrom at least April 18, 2014 to April 15, 2016, Defendants  willfully  failed to pay the overtime due \n \n1  Plaintiff also claimed that Defendants violated the recordkeeping provi sions of the FLSA  \n(i.e., \u00a7 211(c) ), but that was not a standalone violation that Plaintiff pursued. 2 under the FLSA to the following employees :  Fernando Garcia Sanchez, Javier Garcia Sanchez, \nLuis Enrique Garcia Sanchez, Paulino Garcia Sanchez, Jose Guadalupe Rodriguez Cano, Juan \nManuel Rodriguez Cano, Lazaro Rodriguez Cano, Salomon Rodriguez Cano, Andres Sanchez \nCano and Marcelino Sanchez Cano.  ( See i d. \u00b6 6; see also id., Schedule A ( list of  employees at \nissue  attached to Complaint) ).  Plaintiff also sought to enjoin Defendants from committing  future \nviolations of the FLSA overtime provisions and from withholding any overtime backpay due.  (D.I.  1 at 4-5).  Defendants defended  against the allegations primarily on the grounds that  the \nemployees at issue were exempt fro m the FLSA overtime pay requirements because they were \nengaged in agriculture.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 8 at 35; D.I. 30 at 4 ; D.I. 91 at 3).\n2 \nFrom June 30, 2021 to July 2, 2021, the Court presided over a jury trial .  (See D.I. 128, 129 \n& 130) .  The jury found that Mr. DeVilbiss was an employer within the meaning of the FLSA such \nthat he could be liable for failure to pay overtime wages  and that the ten employees at issue were \neither engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce or employed in an \nenterprise engaged  in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce .3  (D.I. 123 at 1).  \nThe jury further found that De fendants had failed to prove that those  ten employees were exempt \nfrom the FLSA\u2019s overtime pay requirements under the agricultural exemption for any relevant \n \n2  Defendants also repeatedly argued that the action was time -barred because Plaintiff did not \nname the individual employees as plaintiffs in the case caption .  (See, e.g., D.I. 19 at pg. 6 \nof 7 (Joint Status Report listing Defendants\u2019 argument) ; D.I. 30 at 3 ( Answer including \nDefendants\u2019 argument as Defense No. 2); D.I. 47 at 4- 11 (Defendants\u2019 premature request \nfor summary judgment on this issue) ; D.I. 53 (D efendants\u2019 Rule 12(c) motion on this \nissue) ).  The Court rejected this argument .  (D.I. 144 at 38:2- 39:8).  Defendants raised the \nissue again in the proposed pretrial order, and the Court again rejected Defendants\u2019 \nposition.  ( See D.I. 91 at 10- 11 (proposed pretrial order) ; see also  D.I. 103 a t 24:6- 10 (ruling \nat final pretrial conference)).   Defendants make the same argument in one of their  post-trial \nmotion s, which the Court addresses infra . \n3  The parties had stipulated that the entity \u2013 DeVilbiss Landscape \u2013  and its employees were  \nsubject to the overtime pay requirements of the FLSA.  ( See D.I. 123 at 1) .   3 time period .  (Id. at 2; see also id. at 3-5).  The jury also found that Defendants \u2019 failure to pay \novertime wages was not willful.  ( Id. at 6).  The jury did not  render a damages  award  because t he \nparties had agreed to calculations for the amounts of overtime backpay due in the event that \nliability was found.  ( See D.I. 126 at 1- 2; see also Tr.  at 386:15- 396:4 & 459:4- 7).4  \nOn July 19, 2021, the Court entered judgment on the jury verdict under Rule 58(b) of the \nFederal Rules  of Civil Procedure.  ( See D.I. 127).   On August 16, 2021, Plaintiff moved to amend  \nthe judgment  under Rule 59(e)  (see D.I. 131 & 132), and Defendants filed a renewed motion for \njudgment as a matter of law  under Rule 50(b)  (see D.I. 133 & 134) and a separate  motion to amend \nor alter the judgment under Rule 59(e) ( see D.I. 135 & 136) .  Briefing on post -trial motions was \ncompleted on September 13, 2021.  ( See D.I. 138, 139, 140, 141, 142 & 143).      \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Judgment as a Matter of Law  \nJudgment as a matter of law may be entered  against a non-moving party if the Court \u201cfinds \nthat a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on \n[an] issue.\u201d  FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1).   Judgment as a matter of law  is appropriate \u201c only if, viewing \nthe evidence i n the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair \nand reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability. \u201d  Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166  (3d C ir. 1993).  Entry of \njudgment as a matter of law is a remedy to be invoked only \u201csparingly.\u201d  CGB Occupational \nTherapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs. Inc., 357 F.3d 375, 383 (3d Cir. 2004). \nFollowing a jury trial, a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) \nmay be granted only if the movant demonstrates \u201cthat the jury\u2019s findings, presumed or express, \n \n4  Citations to \u201cTr.\u201d are citations to the trial transcript.  ( See D.I. 128, 129 & 130). 4 are not supported by substantial evidence or, if they were, that the le gal conclusion(s) implied [by] \nthe jury\u2019s verdict cannot in law be supported by those findings.\u201d  Pannu v. Iolab Corp., 155 F.3d \n1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Substantial \nevidence is such relevant  evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the \nfinding under review.  See Enplas Display Device Corp. v. Seoul Semiconductor Co., 909 F.3d \n398, 407 (Fed. Cir. 2018).   In determining whether substantial evidence  supports the jury verdict , \nthe Court may not make credibility determinations, weigh the evidence or substitute its own conclusions  for that of the jury where the record evidence supports multiple inferences .  \nSee Lightning Lube , 4 F.3d at 1166. \nB. Altering or Amending Judgment  \nRule 59(e) provides that a party may make a motion to alter or amend a judgment within \n28 days after the entry of judgment.  F ED. R. CIV. P. 59(e).  To succeed on a motion to alter or \namend a judgment, the moving party must show :  \u201c(1) an intervening change in the controlling \nlaw; (2) the availability of new evidence that was not available when the court [issued its order]; \nor (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d  Max\u2019s \nSeafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou -Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros , 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. 1999).  The purpose \nof such a motion is to \u201ccorrect manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d  Id.  A motion to alter or amend a \njudgment \u201cthat advances the same arguments already thought through and rejected by the court \u2013  \nrightly or wrongly \u2013 should be denied.\u201d  Lopez Garza v. Citigroup Inc., 2016 WL 7297364, at *1 \n(D. Del. Dec. 9, 2016) (citing Lazaridis v. Wehmer , 591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir. 2010)).  \u201c[T]he \nstandard for obtaining relief under Rule 59(e) is a difficult one to meet.\u201d  Siemens Medical. Sols. \nUSA, Inc. v. Saint Gobain Ceramics & Plastics, Inc., 2009 WL 4891774, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 16, \n2009).   5 III. DISCUSSION  \nA. Defendants\u2019  Post -Trial Motion s  \nAs set forth  above, t he jury found that Defendants \u2019 employees were not exempt from the \novertime pay requirements under the FLSA based on the agricultural exemption  and, as such,  \nDeVilbiss Landscape and Mr. DeVilbiss were liable for unpaid overtime .  (See D.I. 123 at 2- 5).  \nDefendants\u2019 post -trial motions are not focused on whether substantial evidence supported the \njury\u2019s findings as to the agricultural exemption.  Rather, D efendants\u2019 renewed motion for judgment \nas a matter of law under Rule 50(b) argues that  Mr. DeVilbiss is not  liable for the overtime wages \ndue because he is not a  covered employer within the meaning of the FLSA.  ( See D.I. 133 & 134).  \nDefendants separately move under Rule 59(e) to alter the judgment , arguing that  the Court cannot  \nenjoin Mr. DeVilbiss  because he is not an employer under  the FLSA  and, further, that  the Court  \nlacks \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d to enjoin DeVilbiss Landscape .  (See D.I. 135 & 136) .  Also in \nthe same Rule 59(e) motion, Defendants request  reconsideration of their motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings  on the basis that the action is time -barred because Plaintiff failed to name each \nemployee in the case caption.  ( See D.I. 136 at 1-7).  The Court addresses each motion  in turn.   \n1. Defendants\u2019 Renewed Judgment as a Matter of Law t hat Mr. DeVilbiss \nIs Not an \u201cEmployer\u201d Under the FLSA  \nThe parties agreed that DeVilbiss Landscape was an employer within the meaning of the \nFLSA and its employees were covered by the overtime requirements.  ( See D.I. 123 at 1 (\u201cThe \nparties have an agreement that DeVilbiss Landscape Architects is an employer and its employees \nare covered.\u201d) ; see also  Tr. at 311:21- 312:2 & 412:21- 25).  Indeed, Defendants stipulated that the \nSecretary made out his overtime claim under \u00a7 216(c) as to DeVilbiss Landscape and the only issues submitted to the jury were related to Mr. DeVilbiss and the agriculture exemption.  (Tr. at 343:25- 344:6) .  As to Mr. DeVilbiss, t he jury was asked  to decide whether he  was an employer 6 within the meaning of the FLSA  and whether his employees5 were either engaged in commerce \n(or the production of goods for commerce) or employed in an enterprise e ngaged in commerce (or \nthe production of goods for commerce).  ( See D.I. 123 at Question Nos. 1 & 2).  The jury answered \nyes to both \u2013 i.e., that Mr. DeVilbiss was an employer under the FLSA and his employees satisfied \nthe threshold commerce requiremen t to be e ligible for overtime.  ( Id.).  Defendants challenge the \njury\u2019s findings , arguing that \u201c Plaintiff failed to carry its burden of proving that any of \nMr. DeVilbiss\u2019 employees were \u2018engaged in commerce\u2019 so as to hold him liable as an employer \nunder \u00a7 207(a).\u201d   (D.I.  134 at 5) .  In Defendants\u2019 view, this necessarily means that Mr. DeVilbiss \nis not a \u201ccovered\u201d employer under the FLSA  (because Plaintiff purportedly failed to prove \nMr. DeVilbiss\u2019s  employees  were covered) .  (Id. at 4 (\u201cMr. DeVilbiss is Not a \u2018Covered\u2019 \nEmployer.\u2019\u201d)).  Plaintiff argues that Defendants are confusing the concept  of \u201ccoverage\u201d (which \napplies to employees  and gives them  protection under the FLSA ) with the definition  of \u201cemployer\u201d \n(which gives rise to liability  under the FLSA ).  (See  D.I. 138 at 1).  The Court agrees with Plaintiff.  \nThis dispute first arose in connection with jury instructions .  Defendants argued that \nPlaintiff had to prove that Mr. DeVilbiss was not just an employer under the FLSA, but also a \n\u201ccovered\u201d employer under the FLSA.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 101 at 18- 21 (Defendants\u2019 proposed \ninstruction  on coverage )).  Although the parties  struggled to present the issue in a coherent manner , \nthe Court ultimately concluded that Plaintiff did not have to separately prove Mr. DeVilbiss was a \n\u201ccovered\u201d employer within the meaning of the FLSA .  (See Tr. at 199:5- 200:21, 310:1- 339:7 & \n385:13- 4).  Rather, based on the relevant statutory language in connection with the definitions \nprovided in \u00a7 203, the Court found that Mr. DeVilbiss could be  liable for unpaid overtime under \n \n5  The employees at issue with respect to Mr. DeVilbiss are the same ten employees at is sue \nwith respect to  DeVilbiss Landscape.  7 the FLSA as long as (1) he was found to be an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined therein and (2) the employees \nat issue were either engaged in commerce or employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce .  \n(Tr. at 385:21- 386:4).  The jury was instructed accordingly6 and answered both questions in the \naffirmative.  (D.I. 123 at Question Nos. 1 & 2 ; see also  D.I. 121 at 12- 13 (final jury instructions) ).   \nIn ruling on Defendants\u2019 motion under Rule 50(b)  here, t he Court reiterate s its conclusion \non the question of \u201cemployer\u201d versus \u201ccoverage\u201d as it relates to Mr. DeVilbiss .  The relevant FLSA \novertime provision is as follows :  \nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall \nemploy any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in \ncommerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is \nemployed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in \nexcess of the hour s above specified at a rate not less than one and \none-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1).  The threshold requirement  for overtime protection is  from the vantage \npoint of the employee \u2013 i.e., the employee is either engaged in commerce (or in the production of \ngoods for commerce) or employed in an enterprise that is engaged in commerce or the production \nof goods for commerce.  The FLSA defines  \u201centerprise engaged in commerce or in the production \nof goods for commerce\u201d to mean \u201can enterprise that . . . (i) has employees engaged in commerce \nor in the production of goods for commerce, or that has employees handling, selling, or otherwise \nworking on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce by any person; \nand (ii) is an enterprise whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than \n$500,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level that are separatel y stated) .\u201d  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 203(s)(1) (A)(i) -(ii).  And t he FLSA defines \u201c employer\u201d broadly to \u201c include [] any person acting \n \n6  Both sides moved for judgment as a matter of law on this issue and the Court denied both \nmotions.  (Tr. at 339:3 -13; see also id. at  310:1 -16).   8 directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee .\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7  203(d).  \nApart from the employee commerce requirement  above, t he statute says nothing about an employer  \nsatisfying  any threshold test to trigger this FLSA overtime provision.  Moreover, t he plain \nlanguage of the statute shows  that the  threshold commerce requirement for the employee need only \nbe satisfied once.  That is , an employee can be employed in  an enterprise engaged in commerce \n(thereby falling within coverage of the FLSA ) and that employee can also be simultaneously \nemployed by an individual ( e.g., someone who owns an enterprise entity ).  In that situation where \nthere is enterprise coverage for the employee and an individual employer is also involved, the only \nquestion as to the individual employer is whether he or she is an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by the \nFLSA  such as to be liable for any FLSA violations .  That is precisely  the situation here . \nThus, a lthough Defendants are correct that the employees at issue must fall within  the \nthreshold commerce requirement to be eligible for overtime  under \u00a7 207(a)(1)  (see D.I. 134 at 5-\n6), the Secretary is not required to prove this  element for each employer  at issue .7  Indeed, \nDefendants admitted this element was  met when they stipulated that DeVilbiss Landscape\u2019s \nemployees were covered by the FLSA and that  DeVilbiss Landscape was  \u201can enterprise engaged \nin commerce or in the production of goods for commerce \u201d within the  meaning of the FLSA.8  (See, \n \n7  The problem with Defendants\u2019 arguments (and supporting authority) is that they are from \nthe vantage point of the individual employees  \u2013 i.e., actions  initiated by employees , not the \nSecretary.  This distinction is relevant because suits by individuals under \u00a7  216(b) require \na plaintiff to show he is  covered by the FLSA such that he may sue his employer for FLSA \nviolations.  Indeed, many of Defendants\u2019 cases include language about plaintiffs  showing  \nthat the FLSA overtime provision applies .  (See D.I. 134 at 4).  This makes no sense in the \ncontext of an action brought by the Secretary under \u00a7 216(c) , where the plaintiff is the \nSecretary of Labor and does not need to show the FLSA applies to it. \n8  To be sure, Defendants separately stipulated that DeVilbiss Landscape and its employees \nhandled goods that had been moved in interstate commerce and that DeVilbiss Landscape \nhad annual gross revenues exceeding $500,000 for each relevant year.  ( See Tr. at 138:14-\n139:7 & 141:20- 22; see also  id. at 139:10- 140:13 (employees at issue employed by \nDeVilbiss Landscape) ).  These stipulations also establish that the employees at issue were 9 e.g., D.I. 123 at 1 (\u201cThe parties have an agreement that DeVilbiss Landscape Architects is an \nemployer and its employees are covered.\u201d); Tr.  at 412:21- 25 (\u201cThe parties have stipulated that \nduring the relevant time period, the  employees at issue in this case were employed in an enterprise \nthat had annual gross sales of at least $500,000 and was an enterprise engaged in commerce or in \nthe production of goods for commerce.\u201d) ; see also Tr. at 311:21 -312:2 (\u201cTHE COURT:  . . . Do \nyou agree that the coverage issue is not disputed for the entity [DeVilbiss Landscape]?  MR. SULLIVAN:  I think we stipulated to that, Your Honor.\u201d)).  The natural  consequence of these  \nstipulation s is that the ten employees at issue  here all satisfy the commerce requirement set forth \nin the overtime provision of  \u00a7 207(a)(1) .  As such, t he jury was required to answer \u201cYES\u201d to \nQuestion No. 2.  And the jury did.  (D.I. 123 at 1).   There is no basis to disturb t his finding. \nFinally, a lthough Defendants confuse the issue of \u201ccoverage\u201d with \u201c employer \u201d status,  it \nmay be that Defendants \u2019 argument is really about whether Mr. DeVilbiss is also an employer \nalongside DeVilbiss Landscape that is jointly liable for the failure to pay overtime .\n9  That is, the \nissue that Defendants are complaining of is not one of coverage but rather one of personal liability.  Even if that were  Defendants\u2019 argument, however, the Court would not disturb the verdict or shield \nMr. DeVilbiss from liability .  First, Defendants did  not separately challenge the jury\u2019s finding that \nMr. DeVilbiss is an \u201cemployer.\u201d  ( Compare  D.I. 123 at Question No. 1, with D.I. 134 (Defendants\u2019 \nbrief silent on this issue) ).  Indeed, such a challenge  would be difficult  because Defendants \nstipulated th at \u201cPaul DeVilbiss was the owner of DeVilbiss Landscape Architects during the \nrelevant time period . . . [and that] . . . Paul DeVilbiss had the authority to hire, fire, and set rates \n \nemployed in \u201can enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods commerce\u201d \nwithin the meaning of the FLSA, thereby triggering the overtime protections of \u00a7 207(a)(1).  \n9  Again, Defendants conceded that the Secretary prevailed on his overtime claim as it related to the DeVilbiss Landscape  entity.   (Tr. at 343:25- 344:6) . 10 of pay for the [employees at issue].\u201d  (D.I. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7 (admitted facts); see also  Tr. at 140:10- 21 \n(stipulated facts being read into the record); 411:100- 14 (Court instructing the jury as to same)).  \nThese admitted facts support the finding that Mr. DeVilbiss is an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning \nof the FLSA under t he Third Circuit\u2019s  Enterprise  test.  See In re Enter. Rent -A-Car Wage & Hour \nEmp. Pracs. Litig., 683 F.3d 462, 469 (3d Cir. 2012) .  Moreover, t he FLSA \u2019s definition of \n\u201cemployer\u201d is broad and contemplates liability for multiple employers for any given employee.  \n\u201cUnder the FLSA, multiple persons or entities can be responsible for a single employee \u2019s wages \nas \u2018joint employers \u2019 in certain  situations.\u201d  Thompson v. Real Est. Mortg. Network , 748 F .3d 142, \n148 (3d Cir. 2014) ; see also  Dole v. Elliott Travel & Tours, Inc., 942 F.2d 962, 965 (6th Cir. 1991)  \n(\u201cThe FLSA contemplates there being several simultaneous employers who may be responsible \nfor compliance with the FLSA.\u201d (citing Falk v. Brennan, 414 U.S. 190, 195 (1973) )); Donovan v. \nAgnew , 712 F.2d 1509, 1511 (1st Cir. 1983)  (\u201cThe overwhelming weight of authority is that a \ncorporate officer with operational control of a corporation\u2019 s covered enterprise is an employer \nalong with the corporation, jointly and severally liable under the FLSA for unpaid wages.\u201d) .  \nBecause  Mr. DeVilbiss meets the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under the FLSA and multiple \nemployers may be liable for failure to pay overtime, the Court finds no reason to disturb the verdict. \nIn sum, because substantial evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that Mr. DeVilbis s\u2019s \nemployees satisfied the threshold commerce requirement  so as  to be protected by the overtime pay \nrequirements of the FLSA  (and that Mr. DeVilbiss was an \u201cemployer\u201d prope rly held liable under \nthe FLSA) , Defendants\u2019 motion under Rule 50(b) will be denied.   \n2. Defendants\u2019 Motion  Under Rule 59(e)  to Alter the Judgment  and for \nReconsideration of Defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings  \nOn July 19, 2021, the Court entered judgment under Rule 58(b).  ( See D.I. 127).   That \njudgment was derived from a proposed form of judgment that was jointly  submitted by the parties 11 \u2013 one that included a number of agreed -upon provisions .  (See D.I. 126).   Defendants now s eek to \nalter that judgment under Rule 59(e) , arguing that injunctive relief is not proper against DeVilbiss \nLandscape or Mr. DeVilbiss for separate reasons .  (See D.I. 136 at 7 -9).  Also  moving under \nRule  59(e), Defendants request that the Court reconsider its denial of Defendants\u2019 request for \njudgment on the pleadings on the grounds  that this action is time -barred because Plaintiff did not \nname individual employees  as plaintiffs  in the case caption.  (See i d. at 1-7; see also id.  at 1-2 \n(\u201cDefendants respectfully seek reconsideration in order to prevent a manifest error of law and \nmanifest injustice.\u201d) ). \nTurning first to Defendants\u2019 motion  for reconsideration, t he decision for which \nreconsideration is sought is from March 2020.  (See D.I. 79 & 144) .  In that decision, the Court \naddressed  Defendants\u2019 argument that the Secretary must list each individual employee in the case \ncaption in order to constitute a timely filed action  under \u00a7 216.  ( See D.I. 52 & 53).  In particular, \nDefendants argued that  the statute of limitations continues to run for each individual owed \novertime until the Secretary designates the individual s as a party plaintiff s under \u00a7 216(c).  (D.I.  53 \nat 3-9).  In Defendants\u2019 view, this meant that the Secretary was  required to list in the caption as \nplaintiffs each individual purportedly owed overtime by Defendants  for the action to be considered \ncommenced as to those individuals  (and because Plaintiff failed to  ever do so, the action was time -\nbarred).   Plaintiff responded that no such formality was necessary in an action  maintained  by the \nSecretary , arguing that it  was sufficient to name the ten employees at issue in Schedule A attached \nto the Complaint.  (D.I. 54 at 6- 10; see also  D.I. 1, Schedule A) .  At the conclusion of argument \nheld on March 18, 2020, t he Court denied Defendants\u2019 motion, ultimately agreeing with Plaintiff 12 that naming the affected employees in Schedule A was sufficient .  (See D.I. 144 at 38:2- 39:8) .  \nDefendants now10 seek reconsideration of that decision under Rule 59(e).  (D.I. 136 at 1- 7). \nThe purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to \u201ccorrect manifest errors of law or fact or \nto present newly discovered evidence.\u201d  Max\u2019s Seafood, 176 F.3d at  677.  \u201cA proper Rule 59(e) \nmotion . . . must rely on one of three grounds:  (1) an intervening c hange in controlling law; (2) \nthe availability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent \nmanifest injustice.\u201d  Lazaridis v. Wehmer , 591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir. 2010).  Defendants argue \nthat reconsideration is nec essary and appropriate here to correct a clear error of law and to prevent \nmanifest injustice based on a Supreme Court decision that issued on April  29, 2021.  ( See D.I. 136 \nat 1-2).  That case, N iz-Chavez v. Garland, 141 S. Ct. 1474 (2021) , involved a provision of the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act that pauses the period of time a non-resident is considered to have spent in the United States continuously.  The relevant  provision \nstates that a non-resident\u2019s  period of continuous presence in the United States  stops  when the non-\nresident is served with a notice to appear for removal proceedings.  Despite the Government\u2019s \npractice  to the contrary, t he Supreme Court held that the plain language of the statute  require d \nservice of a single document containing all of the requisite information to constitute sufficient \nnotice to trigger the \u201cstop time\u201d provision .  Id. at 1486. \nEven if the Niz -Chavez  case were relevant  to any issue in this cas e, the Court would find  \nDefendants\u2019 request untimely.   Niz-Chavez  issued in April 2021 and Defendants waited until \nAugust 2021 ( i.e., well after trial) to request reconsideration of the ir motion for judgment on the \npleadings.  If Defendants thought Niz -Chavez  at all relevant  to their time -bar arguments , \nDefendants should have raised the issue as soon as the Supreme Court decision issued .  More \n \n10  Defendants never requested reconsideration of the Court\u2019s decision under Local Rule 7.1.5.    13 troubling is that Niz -Chavez  came out before  the parties submitted the proposed pretrial order  on \nJune 16, 2021 \u2013 when Defendants again raised this issue despite the Court already having decided \nit in connection with summary judgment.  ( See D.I. 91 at 10- 11 (Defendants failing to raise Niz -\nChavez )).  And Defendants never mentioned Niz -Chavez  at the final pretrial conference.  It is \nsimply too late for Niz -Chavez  to be a credible basis for Defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration, \neven if that case did constitute an intervening change in controlling law .  See Cirba Inc. v. \nVMWARE, Inc. , No. 19- 742-LPS, 2020 WL 7489765, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 21, 2020)  (finding \nreconsideration arguments waived where movant relied upon case that issued two days before the \nCourt heard oral  argument and three weeks before Court made its decision for which \nreconsideration was sought).  In any event, Niz -Chavez  had nothing do with the FLSA or any \nremotely analogous provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act.  The Court can discern no reason why it is being offered as a justification to modify its ruling \nthat the Secretary of Labor need not list the individual employees as party plaintiffs in the case \ncaption in an FLSA overtime violation ca se.  Therefore, the Court will deny Defendants\u2019 request \nfor reconsideration of the Court\u2019s decision as it relates to the time -bar arguments.  \nFinally, as to Defendants\u2019 motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment \u2019s \ninjuncti ve relief provisions , Defendants\u2019 arguments are not well taken.  The language  in the \noperative judgment is the very language that Plaintiff and Defendants jointly proposed.  ( Compare  \nD.I. 126 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, with D.I. 127 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6).  Defendants agreed to be subject to injunct ions related to \nfuture violations of the FLSA  and from withholding the overtime pay that was due in this case.  \n(Id.).  If Defendants took issue with the form or substance of the injunctive relief provisions  in the \njudgment, they should not have agreed to the language  at all .  Rather , Defendants should have  \ntaken the time to draft provisions  they were satisfied with and  submitted those as a competing 14 proposal to any differing language offered by Plaintiff .11  And a s to the substance of their \narguments, D efendants do not cite a single case that supports their position that DeVilbiss \nLandscape cannot be subject to an injunction because it is currently  \u201cshuttered.\u201d   (See D.I. 136 at \n7-9).  And although Defendants argue that  Mr. DeVilbiss should not be enjoined because he is not \na \u201ccovered\u201d employer within the meaning of the FLSA, the Court has already rejected that \nargument.  ( See supra \u00a7 III.A.1 ).  Defendants make no other arguments as to why the agreed- upon \ninjunction as to Mr. DeVilbiss is improper.  Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motion to alter or amend  the \ninjunctive relief provisions of the judgment will be denied .   \nB. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Amend  the Judgment  \nAs set forth  above, the jury found that Defendants were liable for unpaid overtime to the \nten employees at issue, during the time period spanning from  April 2015 to April 2016.  (D.I. 123 \nat 3-5).  Because the jury found that Defendants \u2019 failure to pay overtime was not willful, Plaintiff  \ncould not recover damages for violations for an additional year \u2013 i.e., violations occurring from \nApril 2014 to April 2015.  ( See D.I. 123 at 6; see also  D.I. 121 at 19 &  21 (final jury instruction \non statute of limitations and willfulness and the impact on damages) ).12  Plaintiff now moves under \nRule 59(e) to amend the judgment to include liquidated damages in the full amount authorized by \nthe statute.  ( See D.I. 131 & 132).  In that same motion  under Rule  59(e) , Plaintiff also requests  \n \n11  That the parties included a boilerplate reservation of rights in their proposed form of \njudgment does not change the Court\u2019s conclusion.  ( See D.I. 126 \u00b6 10).  If that could allow \nDefendants to avoid the language they agreed to, joint proposals would be largely \nmeaningless.  See, e.g., United States v. Swift & Co. , 286 U.S. 106, 119 (1932)  (Cardozo, \nJ.) (\u201c Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen \nconditions should lead us to change what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned. \u201d). \n12  Willful violations of the FLSA operate to extend the statute of limitations from two years to three years.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a) ; see also  Souryavong v. Lackawanna Cty., 872 F.3d \n122, 126 (3d Cir. 2017) . 15 that the Court find as a matter of law that Defendants\u2019 violations were willful.  ( See D.I. 131 at 1; \nD.I. 132 at 9 (\u201cPlaintiff asks that the Court amend the judgment as permitted under Fed. R. Civ. \nPro. 59(e) to reflect that the violations were willful .\u201d)).  The Court will begin with Plaintiff\u2019s \nrequest to amend the judgment to include liquidated damages in the full amount permitted by law. \n1. Plaintiff\u2019s Request to Amend the Judgment to Include Liquidated  \nDamages Under \u00a7 216 \nThe FLSA provides that the Secretary may recover as liquidated damages an amount equal \nto the amount of unpaid overtime owed by the Defendants.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(c) (\u201cThe Secretary \nmay bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of unpaid \nminimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages. \u201d). \n\u201cLiquidated damages are compensatory.  They ease any hardship endured by employees who were \ndeprived of lawfully earned wages.\u201d  Sec\u2019y United States Dep\u2019t of Lab. v. Am. Future Sys., Inc., 873 F.3d 420, 433 (3d Cir. 2017) ; see also  Martin v. Selker Bros., 949 F.2d 1286, 1299 (3d Cir. \n1991)  (explaining that liquidated damages \u201c are compensatory rather than punitive in nature \u201d).  \nMoreover, l iquidated damages  under the FLSA  are mandatory  except where the Court finds the \nemployer acted reasonably  and in good faith.  See  American  Future , 873 F.3d at  433; see also  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (\u201c [I]f the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission \ngiving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA], the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any a mount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in \n[\u00a7 216].\u201d ).  Indeed, liquidated damages are recoverable even in the absence of an intentional \nviolation.  Williams v. Tri- County Growers, Inc., 747 F.2d 121, 129 (3d Cir. 1984) .  Whether to \nreduce or eliminate liquidated damages is a matter left to the Court\u2019s  sound discretion.  See  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260. 16 The employer bears a  \u201cplain and substantial\u201d burden of proving that it should be afforded  \nany discretionary relief from the mandatory liquidated damages re quirement .  Martin v. Cooper \nElec. Supply Co., 940 F.2d 896, 907 (3d Cir. 1991) .  \u201c[E]mployers must show good faith and \nreasonable grounds before a court may exercise \u2018 sound discretion\u2019  to deny or limit liquidated \ndamages. \u201d  Id. ; see also Walton v. United Consumers Club, Inc., 786 F.2d 303, 310 (7th Cir. 1986)  \n(\u201cDouble damages are the norm, single damages the exception, the burden on the employer.\u201d) .  \n\u201cThe good faith requirement is a sub jective one that \u2018 requires that the employer have an honest \nintention to ascertain and follow the dictates of the Act. \u2019\u201d  Cooper Electric Supply , 940 F.2d at  \n907 (quoting Tri-County Grow ers, 747 F.2d at 129).  As to the reasonableness requirement, t he \nemployer\u2019s conduct is assessed  under an objective standard.  See Tri-County Growers , 747 F.2d \nat 129.  \u201cIgnorance alone will not exonerate the employer under the objective reasonableness test. \u201d  \nId.  If the employer cannot produce \u201cplain and substantial evidence\u201d that it satisfies both the good \nfaith and objective reasonableness prongs, the Court has no discretion to deny liquidated damages.  \nId.  This burden is \u201cdifficult\u201d for the employer to meet.  Cooper Elec. Supply Co., 940 F.2d at 908. \nAs to the first prong \u2013 subjective  good faith \u2013 Plaintiff argues that Defendants have offered \nno evidence that they attempted to discern whether they were in compliance with the FLSA\u2019s \novertime requirements .  (D.I. 132 at 6).  In their opposition, the only \u201cevidence\u201d that Defendants \ncite is the fact that the jury found the FLSA violations were not willful.   (D.I. 140 at 6- 7).  In \nDefendants\u2019 view, the jury\u2019s finding of no willfulness \u201c indicates that the jury believed \nMr. DeVilbiss was not aware that the failure to pay the overtime premium was a violation of the \nFLSA. This is the equivalent of a good faith finding.\u201d  ( Id. at 7).  Yet Defendants cite no cases to \nsupport their assertion that a jury\u2019s finding of no willfulness  necessitates a finding of good faith in \nthe liquidated damages inquiry.  This would be an odd result as willfulness and good faith are 17 distinct inquiries, opera ting under different standards, belonging to opposing parties .  See Al \nStewart v. Picante Grille LLC , No. 2:19- 00866- RJC, 2021 WL 5920812, at *10 (W.D. Pa. Dec. \n15, 2021)  (\u201cDefendants conflate the standard for willfulness, upon which a plaintiff bears the \nburden of proof, and the standard for an employer \u2019s relief from otherwise mandatory liquidated \ndamages, i.e., the good faith requirement, upon which the employer bears the burden of proof.\u201d).   \nIn fact , that the Third Circuit permits liquidated damages even in the absence of an intentional \n(i.e., willful) violation shows  that Defendants  cannot be correct .  See Tri-County Growers , \n747 F.2d at 129.  \nMore problematic, however, is that  Defendants provide the Court with no evidence  to \nsupport a finding of  subjective good faith.  ( See D.I. 140 at 6- 7).  To satisfy their burden on this \nfirst prong, Defendants must show they \u201c took affirmative steps to ascertain the [FLSA]\u2019 s \nrequirements, but nonetheless, violated its provisions.\u201d  Cooper Electric Supply , 940 F.2d at 908.  \nThat showing requires evidence .  Defendants do not point the Court to any record evidence that \nshows an honest intent ion to determine the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements with respect to the ten \nemployees at issue here.  The Court has also reviewed the trial record and found the requisite \u201cplain \nand substantial evidence \u201d to be lacking.  Mr. DeVilbiss testified that he was told by third -party  \nLabor Consultants International (\u201cLCI\u201d) that he was in compliance, that his accountant confirmed the same and that he also did some research on the internet.  (Tr. at 178:25- 180:13; see also  Tr. at \n193:2- 194:12 & 194:24- 196:2).  Mr. DeVilbiss \u201cfelt in [hi s] heart\u201d that he was doing the right \nthing.  ( Id. at 180:12).  LCI was not called to testify at trial.  Nor was Mr. DeVilbiss \u2019s accountant .  \nAnd Mr. DeVilbiss offered no documentary evidence of these communications or his own internet \nresearch.  In terms of ascertaining the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements  and how to comply \ntherewith , the Court finds there is insufficient evidence of  the requisi te subjective good faith.   18 Having found that Defendants have failed to come forward with \u201cplain and substantial \nevidence \u201d of their subjective good faith, the Court  is left without discretion to reduce or eliminate \nliquidated damages and need not proceed t o the objective reasonableness prong.  See Tri-County \nGrowers, 747 F.2d at  129; see also  Acosta v. Heart II Heart, LLC , No. 2:17- 1242, 2019 WL \n5197329, at *9 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 15, 2019)  (\u201cBy taking no affirmative steps prior to Wage and \nLabor \u2019s investigation, Defendants cannot demonstrate good faith. This is fatal to Defendants \u2019 \nposition and the Court \u2019s analysis need proceed no further. \u201d).  Plaintiff\u2019s motion to alter or amend \nthe judgment to include liquidated damages in an amount equal to the overtime backpay due  will \nbe granted.  Thus, the judgment will be amended to include an additional $50,622.64 in damages.  \n2. Plaintiff\u2019s Request to Amend the Judgment to Overturn the Jury\u2019s \nFinding that  Defendants\u2019 FLSA Violations Were Not Willful  \nAfter hearing evidence presented by Plaintiff and countervailing evidence offered by \nDefendants, the jury found that Defendants\u2019 failure to pay overtime to the ten employees at issue \nwas not willful.   (See D.I. 123 at 6).  Plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdict that Defendants\u2019 \nconduct was not willful was contrary to the facts and the law and should be vacated.\u201d  (D.I. 132 at 2; see also id. at 9 (\u201cThe facts that the court needs to consider with respect to willfulness are not \nin dispute; the jury made a legal error in not finding willfulness based on the record evidence.\u201d)).  As such, Plaintiff requests under Rule 59(e) that the Court amend the judgment to find that Defendants\u2019 failure to pay overtime was wi llful as a matter of law.  ( See id.  at 9-12).  The Court \ndisagrees that Rule 59(e) is the proper mechanism to advance these arguments.     \n\u201cRule 59(e) allows a trial court to correct a verdict that is incorrect as a matter of law.\u201d  \nWatcher v. Pottsville A rea Emergency Med. Servs., Inc., 248 F. App\u2019x 272, 275 (3d Cir. 2007); \nsee also Keifer v. Reinhart Foodservices, LLC , 563 F. App\u2019x 112, 115 (3d Cir. 2014) (\u201c[I]f the \njury erred as a matter of law in awarding loss of future earnings and/or future medical expenses to 19 Peter, the District Court could have rectified that error through the Rule 59(e) motion . . . .\u201d).  A \nmotion to amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) is not meant to advance arguments about the sufficiency of the evidence or what a plaintiff believ es the factfinder should have concluded.  See, \ne.g., Pharmacy Corp. of Am./Askari Consol. Litig., No. 16- 1123- RGA, 2021 WL 4033238, at *3 \n(D. Del. Sept. 3, 2021) (\u201cPlaintiffs use this [Rule 59(e)] briefing to reargue its trial evidence, while claiming that the Court erred in its findings and conclusions, seemingly because Plaintiffs simply \ndisagree with the Court \u2019s consideration of the evidence and evidentiary decisions. That is not the \npurpose of a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e).\u201d);  see also Robinson v. Watts \nDetective Agency, Inc. , 685 F.2d 729, 742 (1st Cir. 1982) (\u201cA motion to alter or amend judgment \npursuant to Rule 59(e) may not be granted where to do so would undermine the jury\u2019s fact -finding \nrole and trample on the defendant\u2019s  seventh amendment right to a jury trial.  If the relief sought \nhere were granted, it would require a reexamination of the facts found by the jury and a finding of liability where the jury had expressly found none.\u201d (citations omitted)).  \nDespite styling its motion as a motion under Rule 59(e), Plaintiff\u2019s request seeks judgment \nas a matter of law under  properly brought under  Rule 50(b).  Plaintiff claims that he is not asking \nthe Court to reweigh evidence or credibility determinations.  (D.I. 132 at 10 n.5).  But he is.    Indeed, Plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he undisputed evidence that was presented at trial proves by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Defendants willfully violated the FLSA because they were aware that they needed to pay overtime and f ailed to pay it\u201d and that \u201cDefendants\u2019 excuses for why \nthey stopped paying overtime are not credible reasons to find that the violation was not willful.\u201d  (Id. at 10 -11).  These are, in fact, requests that the Court substitute its judgment for that of the jury \n\u2013 requests that belong in motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Plaintiff, however, did not move \nfor judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) on the issue of willfulness before the case was 20 submitted to the jury.13  The Court will not hear thes e arguments now disguised as a Rule 59(e) \nmotion.  See Brown v. Grass , 544 F. App\u2019x 81, 85 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201cAlthough Brown requests \njudgment in her favor under Rule 59(e), she is, at bottom, making a sufficiency of the evidence \nargument, asserting that the  evidence admits of only one conclusion:  a material breach occurred.  \nThat argument is foreclosed, however, because Brown did not move for judgment as a matter of law based on the sufficiency of the evidence before the case was submitted to the jury, as i s \nrequired by Rule 50.\u201d) .  Therefore, Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the judgment to find willfulness as \na matter of law will be denied.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff \u2019s motion to amend the judgment  (D.I. 131) is \nGRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART , Defendants\u2019 renewed motion for judgment as a \nmatter of law (D.I. 1 33) is DENIED and Defendants \u2019 motion  to amend the judgment (D.I. 135) is \nDENIED.  An appropriate order will follow. \n \n13  After moving for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of Mr. DeVilbiss\u2019s status as an \n\u201cemployer,\u201d all Plaintiff said on willfulness was this:  \u201cwe would move \u2013 the other weeks \nfor willfulness, potentially .\u201d  (Tr. at 310:25- 311:1 (emphasis added) ).
