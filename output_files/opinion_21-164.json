Stark", "date": "02-02-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nDATACLOUD TECHNOLOGIES, LLC \nPlaintiff, \nV. C.A. No. 21-164-LPS \nSQUARESPACE, INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington this 2nd day of February, 2022: \nWHEREAS, Defendant Squarespace, Inc. (\"Squarespace\" or \"Defendant\") filed a \nrenewed motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) \n(see D.I. 24); \nWHEREAS , Defendant and Plaintiff DataCloud Technologies, LLC (\"DataCloud\" or \n\"Plaintiff' ') submitted briefing and other materials relating to Squarespace 's motion (see, e.g., \nD.I. 25, 27, 29); \nWHEREAS, having carefully considered the briefing and related materials, the Court \nheard argument on Squarespace's motion by teleconference on January 20, 2022; \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant's motion (D.I. 24) \nis DENIED . \nThe Court's Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the conclusion of the \nhearing, excerpts of which are reproduced below. 1 \n1 The Court adopts the full bench ruling. For clarity, the excerpt of the transcript contains some \nminor stylistic adjustments beyond those explicitly called out below. \n1 I think we all agree what the 12(c) standard is for judgment on the pleadings[;] it's \nsimilar to the Rule 12(b)(6) standard. I'm not going to talk at any greater length \nabout that. \nThe motion largely focuses on Squarespace 's view that the statutory phrase \n\"particularly pointing out\" found in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, ,r 2 prescribes the rule that \n\"the function of a machine cannot be patented.\"[2] \nSection 112, ,r 2 provides [that] \"[t]he specification shall conclude with one or more \nclaims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the \napplicant regards as his invention. \" \nAnd Squarespace argues that this \"particularl y pointing out\" provision in\u00a7 112, ,r 2 \ncarries forward nearly identically in language from the Patent Act of 1870 and the \nPatent Act of 1836, such that it is a reenactment of that earlier language. \nIn support of its position, Squarespace cites numerous Supreme Court decisions \nthat have applied and construed the \"particularl y pointing out\" language found in \nthose earlier Patent Acts, including especially the Halliburton[3] case from 1946, \nthe United Carbon[4] decision from 1942, [ and] the Morse[5] decision from 1853. \nThrough these decisions, Squarespace contends that the Supreme Court has \ndeveloped and enforced \"the rule that a patentee may not broaden his claims by \ndescribing the product in terms of function.\"[6] \nAlthough none of these cases apply \u00a7 112, ,r 2 specifically , defendant relies on the \npresumption that when Congress adopts language used in an earlier statute, it also \nadopts the Court's earlier construction of that language. That principle can be \nfound in, for instance, Helsinn Healthcare v. Teva. [7] \nDataCloud responds that the Patent Act of 1952, including through its inclusion of \n\u00a7 112, ,r 6, abrogated Halliburton and the rule against functional claiming. And it \ncites several Federal Circuit cases for exactly that proposition -the abrogation of \nHalliburton . \n2 Boyden Power-Brake Co. v. Westinghouse , 170 U.S. 537, 562 (1898). \n3 Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Walker, 329 U.S. 1 (1946). \n4 United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317 U.S. 228 (1942). \n5 O'Reilly v. Morse, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 62 (1853). \n6 United Carbon, 317 U.S. at 234. \n7 Helsinn Healthcare SA. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 628, 633-34 (2019). \n2 For instance, [in] Greenberg[8] in 1996 . . . , the Federal Circuit explained that \nCongress enacted \u00a7 112, 16 to \"overrule\" the holding in Halliburton that claims \ndrafted in means-plus-function fashion were invalid. And the Valmont decision \nfrom the Federal Circuit in 1993 [explained that] \"Congress added [\u00a7 112, 16] to \nthe Patent Act of 1952 to change the doctrine enunciated in Halliburton ,\" [adding \nthat] \"the 1952 Act rendered Halliburton obsolete. \"[9] ... \nThe defendant, of course, has its responses to these abrogation arguments, including \nby pointing out -and I think it's not disputed -that the Supreme Court has not \nclearly and explicitly endorsed the view of the Federal Circuit from Greenberg and \nValmont. \nSquarespace also cites and quotes from the Markman[10] decision in 1996, and \nwe've talked about this quote throughout the day: \"[A] claim covers and secures a \nprocess, a machine, a manufacture , a composition of matter, or a design, but never \nthe function or result of either.\" \nThat's the legal issue that the defendant presents in its motion and wants me to \ndecide. I'm not deciding that issue. I believe I have discretion not to do so. \nI further think that reasonable minds can differ on what the correct answer as a \nmatter of law is to the question that the defendant posed. \nAs a matter of case management and my discretion, I think it's best not to try to \nanswer that question in this case at this early stage, for reasons that include, very \nprominently, that the defendant has not yet shown or even come close to showing \nor given me the tools to figure out if [it is] right that even if the law is as [the \ndefendant says] ... that the result ... would [be that I would] invalidate 144 claims \nfrom seven patents. \nSo, again, even if I assume that the defendant is right on the law, it does not follow \nlogically that the defendant wins this motion. And the defendant hasn't given me, \nin the briefing, anything near what I would need to have the confidence that [it is] \nright about that latter part. \n[L ]et me address some of the specific arguments the defendant makes to the \ncontrary. [It] suggest[s] , at least very clearly today, that these claims are clearly \nand convincingly invalid on their face. Well, if that's true, [the defendant has] done \nnothing to show that to me. As I indicated , the briefing is essentially , when it gets \n8 Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Inc., 91 F.3d 1580, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \n9 Valmont Indus., Inc. v. Reinke Mfg. Co., 983 F.2d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1993). \n10 Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 373 (1996). \n3 down to the patents-in-suit, seven, essentially , repetitive [paragraphs] that do little \nmore than quote the claim language -some of the claim language, obviously, not \nall 144 claims; and try to reiterate what the Halliburton rule is. \nIt may be that these claims are clearly and convincingly invalid on their face, [but] \nthat would have to be analyzed from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in \nthe art. I am not such a person and I have nothing in my record to help me \nunderstand whether the defendant [is] right that a person of ordinary skill in the art \nwould view the claims exactly the way the defendant argues. \nI have a declaration from an employee of the defendant essentially saying [\"JI agree \nwith the [Answer] that my employer filed.[\"] That doesn't come close, in my view, \nto making out a clear and convincing [case] that 144 claims are invalid on their \nface. \nThe defendant 's proposal also, in my view, makes no sense from a case \nmanagement perspective, at least not in the context of this case. For example, [the \ndefendant] repeatedly tell[s] me things like: I should assume for the purposes of the \nmotion that the plaintiff's claim construction positions are correct, that the claims \nmean what the plaintifll] say[s]. But the plaintiffl] ha[s]n't told me what [its] \nclaims say. And the defendant[] ha[s] pointed to no obligation on the plaintiffs \npart to tell me with any expressed clarity or specificity what exactly [plaintiff] \nthink[ s] each of the claims mean. \nRule 8 does not require the plaintiff[] to set out [its] claim construction positions. \nI've entered no order in this case that requires [it] to give us [its] claim construction \npositions. So I can't assume, for the sake of argument, that [its] construction \npositions are right because I don't know what they are and that's through no fault \nof the plaintiff. \nSimilarly , the defendant ha[s] faulted the plaintiff for not challenging things like \nthe defendant's verified Answer being purportedly based on the views of a person \nof ordinary skill in the art, but there was no occasion, no obligation , for the plaintiff \nto challenge those things at this very early stage of this case. \nRelatedly, we've talked a lot about\u00a7 112, ,r 6. I certainly reserve the right, because \nthe law reserves it to me, to construe any of these claim terms that may be in dispute \nas [means-plus-function claim terms subject to]\u00a7 112, ,r 6. The parties can't take \nthat away from me. And the plaintiff has said today, I think it was implicit before \ntoday but it's explicit today, that [it] reserve[s] the right to even argue and ask the \nCourt to construe these claims or some of them as [subject to]\u00a7 112, ,r 6. And [it] \npointed out that some of them use language that might even invoke the presumption \nthat they were [subject to] \u00a7 112, ,r 6. \n4 And ... once I reach that conclusion , it follows, in my mind, that I have no choice \nbut to deny this motion. And I need to get to claim construction before I could \nproperly address the legal issue that the defendant[] want[ s] me to decide at the \noutset of this case. \n5 HO LELEONARDP.
