{"case_name": "Ayers v. Commissioner Perry Phelps et al", "case_number": "19-1738", "judge": "Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Hall", "date": "08-31-2022", "ocr_text": " \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nJARREAU A. AYERS , \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n \nMARC RICHMAN , et al. ,  \n \nDefendant s.   \n  \n  C.A. No. 19- 1738- JLH \n    \n \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n At Wilmington, this 3 1st day of August, 2022, having considered Plaintiff\u2019s motions for \nsummary judgment (D.I. 44, 54), motions to withdraw his  motions for summary judgment  (D.I. \n57, 69), letter/motion requesting settlement negotiations  (D.I. 45) , letter s/motions  requesting a \nRule 26(f) conference  and to proceed with discovery  (D.I. 48, 53,  68, 77, 78, 79) , and motion s for \nappointment of counsel (D.I. 52, 67 ), and Defendant Carrothers\u2019s motion for judgment on the \npleadings  (D.I. 47) ; \n IT IS ORDERED that  Defendant Carrothers\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings (D.I. \n47) is GRANTED for the following reasons:  \n Defendant Carrothers\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is based on his contention \nthat Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint fails to state a claim.  \u201c A motion for judgment on the pleadings \nbased on the defense that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim is analyzed under the same \nstandards that apply to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\u201d  Revell v. Port Auth. of N.Y.  & N.J., 598 F.3d 128, \n134 (3d Cir. 2010) .  Plaintiff has not opposed the motion, and the Court concludes that it should \nbe granted.  At the time of the events alleged in the amended complaint, Defendant  Carrothers  was \nSecurity Superintendent of the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center. The E leventh Amendment 2 \n of the United States Constitution protects a non- consenting state or state agency from a suit brought \nin federal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of the relief sought.  See Seminole Tribe of \nFla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996).  Accordingly, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary \ndamages against a state official in his official capacity are barred by the Eleventh Amendment \n(absent consent).  See Will v. Mich . Dep\u2019t of State Police , 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989). The State of \nDelawar e has neither consented to Plaintiff \u2019s suit nor waived its immunity. Accordingly, Plaintiff \ncannot proceed against Defendant Carrothers in his official capacity.  \nNor can Plaintiff proceed against  Defendant  Carrothers  in his individual capacity. Liability \nin a \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature; to be liable, a defendant must have been personally involved in the wrongful conduct.  In other words, defendants are \u201c liable only for their own \nunconstitutional conduct.\u201d   Barkes v. First Corr. Med., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir. 2014), \nrev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v. Barkes , 575 U.S. 822 (2015). Plaintiff \u2019s amended \ncomplaint does not contain any allegations of personal involvement by Carrothers.  It puts forth \nno facts specific to him at all; rather, the amended complaint suggests that Carrothers is being sued \ndue to his position as Security Superintendent .  (See D.I. 6 (Amended Complaint) 4 (alleging that \nCarrothers was  \u201clegally responsible for the inmates at [JTVCC]\u201d).)   Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot \nmaintain a \u00a7 1983 claim against Carrothers in his individual capacity.  The claims against \nCarrothers will be dismissed.\n1   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, only with respect t o Defendant Richman:2 (1) Plaintiff\u2019s \nmotion s to withdraw his motions for summary judgment (D.I. 57, 69) are GRANTED, and \n \n1 Plaintiff has leave to amend his claim against Defendant Carrothers  within 21 days . \n \n2 Pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, P laintiff\u2019s claims \nagainst Defendant Connections Community Support Programs, Inc. are stayed.  ( See D.I. 43, 63)  3 \n Plaintiff\u2019s motions for summary judgment (D.I. 44, 54) are deemed withdrawn; ( 2) Plaintiff\u2019s \nmotion for settlement negotiations (D.I.  45) is DENIED  without prejudice to the ability of any \nparty to request a mediation referral  after summary judgment motions are fully briefed; ( 3) \nPlaintiff\u2019s requests for a Rule 26(f) meeting and to proceed with discovery  (D.I. 48, 53, 68, 77, 78, \n79) are GRANTED -IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART ; and (4) Plaintiff\u2019s requests for \nappointment of counsel (D.I. 52, 67) are DENIED , for the following reasons:  \n Because Plaintiff is incarcerated, the parties are not required to engage in a Rule 26(f) \nconference.  Se e Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(B)(iv), (f)(1).  Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff\u2019s \nrequest for a Court order requiring Defendants to participate in a Rule 26(f) conference.  Plaintiff \nand Defendant Richman agree that the Court should enter a scheduling order .  (D.I. 56, 68, 77.)  \nThe Court will separately enter a scheduling order  governing Plaintiff\u2019s claim against Defendant \nRichman .  Plaintiff\u2019s request for an expedited trial is denied.  Plaintiff\u2019s motions for discovery  \nfrom Defendant Richma n (D.I. 78, 79) shall be deemed requests for di scovery filed with the Court \npursuant to Local Rule 5.4(a); Defendant R ichman shall respond in accordance with the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules.  The record before the Court suggests that mediation \nis unlikely to be fruitful at this time.  Any party may request a mediation referral after the record \nis further developed, i.e. , when summary judgment motions are fully brief ed.   \n A pro se  litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory right to \nrepresentation by counsel.  See Brightwell v. Lehman , 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron \nv. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).  However, representation by counsel may be appropriate \nunder certain circumstances, after a finding that a plaintiff \u2019s claim has arguable merit in fact and \nlaw.  See Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.  After passing this threshold inquiry, the Court considers a number \nof factors when assessing a request  for counsel. These include: (1) the merits of the plaintiff \u2019s 4 \n claim; (2) the plaintiff \u2019s ability to present his or her case considering his or her education, literacy, \nexperience, and the restraints placed upon him or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the \nlegal issues; (4) the degree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff \u2019s ability to \npursue such investigation; (5) the plaintiff \u2019s capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; \nand (6) the degree to which the case turns  on credibility determinations or expert testimony.  See \nMontgomery v. Pinchak , 294 F.3d 492, 498\u201399 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155\u201356.  The list \nis not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157. \nAssuming, solely for the purpose of deciding Plaintiff\u2019s request for appointment of counsel , \nthat his claims have merit in fact and law, several of the Tabron factors militate against granting \nhis request at this time .  A review of the docket  indicates that the issues are not complex. In \naddition, to date, the filings demonstrate Plaintiff \u2019s ability to articulate his claims and represent \nhimself .  In light of the foregoing, the Court will deny Plaintiff\u2019s request for counsel without \nprejudice to renew at a later stage of the case once the record is further developed.  Should the need for counsel arise later, Plaintiff may seek counsel  at that time.  \n \n       __________________________________        THE HONORABLE JENNIFER L.
