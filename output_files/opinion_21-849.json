Fallon", "date": "03-08-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nVOUND COLORADO, LTD., and )\nVOUND, LLC, )\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civil Action No. 21-849-LPS-SRF\nE-HOUNDS, INC.,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION!\n\nPresently before the court in this action for trademark infringement and breach of\ncontract is defendant E-Hounds, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d) motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).? (D.I. 10) For the following reasons, Defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss is DENIED.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs Vound Colorado, Ltd. (\u201cVound Colorado\u201d) and Vound, LLC (\u201cVound;\u201d\ntogether with Vound Colorado, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) initiated this trademark action pursuant to 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1125 on June 14, 2021. (D.I. 1) Plaintiffs maintain their principal place of business in\nScottsdale, Arizona. (D.I. 1 at [\u00a7 1-2) Vound Colorado is incorporated in Colorado, and Vound\nis incorporated in Delaware. (/d.) Defendant is a Florida corporation with its principal place of\nbusiness in Palm Harbor, Florida. (/d. at ]4) Plaintiffs and Defendant are in the business of\n\nproviding computer forensics services. (Id. at {{ 3, 5)\n\n' On January 6, 2022, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned judicial officer\nfor purposes of resolving the instant motion to dismiss. (D.I. 27)\n\n2 The briefing and related filings associated with the pending motion to dismiss are found at D.I.\n11, DI. 16, D.L. 17, and D.I. 18.\nPlaintiffs develop and sell a family of digital forensic products under the Intella\u00ae brand.\n(D1. 1 at $11) Plaintiffs\u2019 Intella\u00ae software products are protected by U.S. Trademark\nRegistration No. 5,787,612 (\u201cthe 612 Registration\u201d). (Jd. at ] 12) The Vound trademark is not\nregistered, but the complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have accrued common law rights in the\nunregistered mark through its extensive use of the mark in connection with its sales and\ndistribution of its software products. (Id. at \u00a5 15)\n\nIn the complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant bought licenses to use Plaintiffs\u2019\nIntella\u00ae Pro and Intella\u00ae Connect software programs in 2011 and 2014, subject to the terms of\nthe Software License Agreement (\u201cSLA\u201d). (D.L. 1 at \u00a7f 17-18) Plaintiffs provided Defendant\nwith a USB \u201cDongle\u201d for each of the two Intella\u00ae software programs to enable the software.\n(Id.) Defendant also purchased an annual Support and Maintenance Agreement from Plaintiffs\nfor the duration of each of the licenses between 2011 and 2020. (Jd. at | 20)\n\nThe SLA provides that, \u201c[b]y using, copying or distributing all or any portion of our\nsoftware, you accept all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement... . If you do not agree to\nthe terms of this Agreement, you may not use the Software.\u201d (D.I. 1, Ex. A at Preamble) To\nprevent the unauthorized use of the Intella\u00ae software, the SLA explains that use of the Dongle is\nrequired:\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without\n\nlimitation payment of the license fee ... Vound grants to You a non-exclusive,\n\nnon-transferable, limited right to Use the Software, in object code form only, and\n\nassociated Documentation, solely for Your internal business purposes. ... You\n\nmay Use the Software on any device connected to the USB device (the \u201cDongle\u201d)\n\nissued by Vound. Vound will only issue one Dongle in connection with this\n\nAgreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the Maintenance and Support\n\nAgreement, Vound will not replace lost, stolen or damaged Dongles.\n\n(D.I. 1, Ex. A at 92) The SLA also contains a forum selection clause specifying that\n[t]his Agreement is made under, shall be governed by and construed in\n\naccordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., excluding its choice\n\nof law provisions. Courts located in the State of Delaware shall have exclusive\n\njurisdiction over any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based upon\n\nany right arising out of, this Agreement. You and Vound irrevocably submit to\n\nthe personal jurisdiction of such courts, waive any objection to venue and consent\n\nto service of process by registered mail[.]\n\n(LI. 1, Ex. A at J 16)\n\nIn November 2020, Plaintiffs discovered that Defendant modified the Intella\u00ae software\nto suggest that Defendant was the developer and seller of the software, in violation of the SLA.\n(D1. 1 at {] 26-31) At the same time, Plaintiffs discovered that Defendant obtained an\nunauthorized Dongle and established sub-domains on its website to host at least four\nunauthorized instances of Intella\u00ae software for its customers. (/d. at [{] 34-35, 42-44)\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA defendant seeking to dismiss a case for improper venue under Rule 12(b)(3) bears the\nburden to establish that venue is improper. See Myers v. Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, 695 F.2d 716, 724-\n25 (3d Cir. 1982); Graphics Prop. Holdings Inc. v. Asus Computer Int'l, Inc., 964 F. Supp. 2d\n320, 324 (D. Del. 2013). Generally, \u201cvenue provisions are designed . . . to allocate suits to the\nmost appropriate or convenient federal forum.\u201d Brunette Mach. Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Indus.,\nInc., 406 U.S. 706, 710 (1972). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b), venue is proper in: (1) a\njudicial district in which any defendant resides; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part\nof the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred; or (3) any judicial district in which\nany defendant is subject to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b).\n\nIn considering a motion to dismiss for improper venue, the court accepts as true the\n\nallegations in the complaint, \u201calthough the parties may submit affidavits in support of their\n\npositions,\u201d and the court must \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences and resolve all factual conflicts in\nthe plaintiff[\u2019]s favor.\u201d Leor v. Gil, C.A. No. 15-732-GMS, 2016 WL 1718222, at *3 (D. Del.\nApr. 27, 2016) (quoting Giuliano v. CDSI Holding Co., 2014 WL 1032704, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar.\n17, 2014)); see also Bookman v. First Am. Mktg. Corp., 459 F. App\u2019x 157, 158 n.1, 160 (3d Cir.\n2012). Objections to venue are waivable in the form of a valid forum selection clause. See Atl.\nMarine Constr. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for W. Dist. of Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) (\u201c[A] valid\nforum-selection clause [should be] given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional\ncases.\u201d); Wall Street Aubrey Golf, LLC v. Aubrey, 189 F. App\u2019x 82, 87 (3d Cir. 2006)\n(acknowledging that objections to venue are waivable).\n\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Validity and Enforceability of the SLA\n\nDefendant begins its argument by suggesting that this court lacks personal jurisdiction\nunder the legal standard applicable to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion? (D.L. 11 at 6-12) The substance\nof Defendant\u2019s argument regarding specific personal jurisdiction is limited to the validity and\nenforceability of the SLA and the forum selection clause contained therein. (Jd. at 8-11)\nSpecifically, Defendant argues that the SLA has no obvious connection to Defendant because it\nlacks details such as the Defendant\u2019s name and the circumstances of its creation and acceptance.\n\n(Id. at 9-10)\n\n3 Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), the nonmoving party bears the burden of showing the basis for\njurisdiction. See Power Integrations, Inc. v. BCD Semiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365,\n369 (D. Del. 2008). The plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction,\nwhich may be established by showing sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum\nstate. See O\u2019Connor v. Sandy Lane Hotel Co., 496 F.3d 312, 316 (3d Cir. 2007); Mellon Bank\n(E) PSFS, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Farino, 960 F.2d 1217, 1223 (3d Cir. 1992). \u201cWhen reviewing a\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), a court must accept as true all allegations of\njurisdictional fact made by the [nonmoving party] and resolve all factual disputes in the\n[nonmoving party\u2019s] favor.\u201d Monsanto v. Syngenta Seeds, Inc., 443 F. Supp. 2d 636, 642 (D.\nDel. 2006).\nIn considering Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court accepts the pleaded allegations as\ntrue. See Bookman, 459 F. App\u2019x at 158 n.1, 160. The complaint alleges that Defendant agreed\nto personal jurisdiction in Delaware by executing the SLA. (D.I. 1 at \u00a29) The SLA contains a\nforum selection clause providing that Delaware courts have exclusive jurisdiction over litigation\narising from enforcement of the SLA. (D.I. 1, Ex. A at | 16) The personal jurisdiction\nrequirement is waivable, and parties to a contract may voluntarily consent to personal\njurisdiction by agreeing to a forum selection clause. See Bus Air, LLC v. Woods, C.A. No. 19-\n1435-RGA-CJB, 2019 WL 6329046, at *15\u201416 (D. Del. Nov. 26, 2019), report and\nrecommendation adopted, 2019 WL 8137577 (D. Del. Dec. 17, 2019); see also Eastman Chem.\nCo. v. AlphaPet Inc., C.A. No. 09-971-LPS-CJB, 2011 WL 6004079, at *4 (D. Del. Nov. 4,\n2011) (citing Res. Ventures, Inc. v. Res. Mgmt. Int'l, Inc., 42 F. Supp. 2d 423, 431 (D. Del. 1999)\n(\u201cWhen a party is bound by a forum selection clause, the party is deemed to have expressly\nconsented to personal jurisdiction.\u201d)).\n\nThe existence of a valid forum selection clause obviates the need to perform a\njurisdictional analysis under the Delaware long-arm statute and Due Process Clause. See\nTruinject Corp. v. Nestle Skin Health, S.A., C.A. No. 19-592-LPS-JLH, 2019 WL 6828984, at *8\n(D. Del. Dec. 13, 2019) (citing Solae, LLC v. Hershey Canada, Inc., 557 F. Supp. 2d 452, 456\n(D. Del. 2008)). But Defendant challenges the validity and enforceability of the SLA because\nthe agreement does not identify Defendant as a contracting party or specify the dates and\n\ncircumstances of the SLA\u2019s creation and acceptance. (D.I. 11 at 8-9) Defendant also\nemphasizes the inconspicuous location of the forum selection clause within the SLA.\u2018 (Jd. at 10-\n11)\n\nDefendant has not carried its burden to show that the forum selection clause in the SLA is\nnot valid or enforceable. See WS Bremen y. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972)\n(concluding that a forum selection clause should be enforced unless there is a \u201cstrong showing\nthat it should be set aside,\u201d and the party challenging the clause bears the burden of establishing\nits unenforceability). The complaint alleges that \u201cDefendant agreed in the [SLA] that courts\nlocated in the state of Delaware shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action based upon any\nright arising out of the SLA,\u201d and \u201cDefendant conceded personal jurisdiction by agreeing to the\nSLA.\u201d (D.I. 1 at ff 8-9) The complaint further alleges that Defendant purchased a license to use\nthe Intella\u00ae Software governed by the terms of the SLA, and then violated those terms by\nmodifying the Intella\u00ae Software. (/d. at 21, 30) It is reasonable to infer from these\nallegations that Defendant clicked to accept the terms of the SLA. See Micro Focus (US), Inc.\nv. Ins. Servs. Office, Inc., 125 F. Supp. 3d 497, 500 (D. Del. 2015) (rejecting argument that click-\nwrap agreement was unenforceable at the pleading stage because defendant\u2019s acceptance of the\n\nclick-wrap agreement could be inferred from pleaded allegations that defendant used the\n\n4 Defendant\u2019s suggestion that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because it is \u201cburied\u201d\nin the last paragraph of the SLA is without merit. (D.I. 11 at 10-11; D.I. 18 at 3-4) The SLA is\nfour pages in its entirety. (DJ. 1, Ex. A)\n\n5 The pleaded allegations are sufficient by themselves to give rise to a plausible inference that\nDefendant accepted the terms of the SLA. Nonetheless, \u201c[t]he court may examine facts outside\nthe complaint to determine proper venue, but must draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all\nfactual conflicts in the plaintiff[\u2019]s favor.\u201d Fellner v. Phila. Toboggan Coasters, Inc., 2005 WL\n2660351, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 18, 2005) (citing Heft v. AAJ Corp., 355 F. Supp. 2d 757, 762\n(M.D. Pa. 2005)). Here, the Declaration of R. Peter Mercer provides additional support for\ndenying Defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(3) motion by establishing that Defendant\u2019s acceptance of the\nSLA was required before installation of the Intella\u00ae Software could occur. (D.I. 17, Ex. 1) The\ndeclaration further includes evidence of Defendant\u2019s payment for use of the software. (/d., Ex.\n2)\nsoftware). Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor in accordance with the Rule\n12(b)(3) standard, these allegations are sufficient to plausibly plead the validity of Defendant\u2019s\nconsent to the terms of the SLA. See Bookman, 459 F. App\u2019x at 158 n.1, 160.\n\nDefendant acknowledges that the absence of Defendant\u2019s signature on the SLA is not\nenough to render the click-wrap agreement unenforceable. (D.I. 18 at 2); see Juju, Inc. v. Native\nMedia, LLC, C.A. No. 19-402-CFC-CJB, 2020 WL 3208800, at *9 n.6 (D. Del. June 15, 2020)\n(finding allegations were sufficient to plausibly plead assent by each side, despite lack of\nsignatures, where agreement was a click-wrap agreement and complaint alleged that defendants\nconsented by clicking boxes). And express allegations that Defendant clicked the accept button\nare not required where, as here, it is reasonable to infer from the complaint that Defendant\naccepted the SLA\u2019s terms to use the Intella\u00ae Software. See Micro Focus, 125 F. Supp. 3d at\n500. Indeed, courts have held that a plaintiff is not required to allege detailed facts supporting\nthe validity and enforceability of a forum selection clause because it is the defendant who bears\nthe burden of establishing the invalidity of the forum selection clause. Eastman Chem. Co. v.\nAlphaPet Inc., C.A. No. 09-971-LPS-CJB, 2011 WL 6004079, at *4 (D. Del. Nov. 4, 2011)\n(internal citations omitted). At this stage of the case, the forum selection clause is presumed to\nbe valid. See QVC, Inc. v. Your Vitamins, Inc., 753 F. Supp. 2d 428, 432 (D. Del. 2010) (\u201cForum\nselection clauses are presumptively valid and are entitled to great weight.\u201d). Applying the Rule\n12(b)(3) standard, the court accepts as true the pleaded allegations that Defendant accepted the\nterms of the SLA. Leor v. Gil, C.A. No. 15-732-GMS, 2016 WL 1718222, at *3.\n\nB. Venue\n\nDefendant argues that this case must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3) or\n\ntransferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) because there is no dispute that Defendant does not\nsatisfy the statutory criteria of \u00a7 1391(b). (D.I. 11 at 13-14) Here, however, the complaint\nalleges that Defendant agreed to litigate any actions arising from the SLA in Delaware, and the\nSLA expressly provides that \u201c[c]ourts located in the State of Delaware shall have exclusive\njurisdiction over any Action seeking to enforce .. . this Agreement. You and Vound irrevocably\nsubmit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts, [and] waive any objection to venue[.]\u201d (D.I. 1\nat | 9; Ex. A at] 16) Because Defendant allegedly waived its objection to venue, the action may\nproceed in this district \u201ceven though venue would not otherwise be proper under section 1391.\u201d\nHowmedica Osteonics Corp. v. Howard, 2020 WL 1102494, at *5 (D.N.J. Jan. 17, 2020)\n(quoting Park Inn Int'l, L.L.C. v. Mody Enters., Inc., 105 F. Supp. 2d 370, 375 (D.N.J. 2000)).\nConsequently, Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or transfer for improper venue under Rule 12(b)(3)\nand \u00a7 1406(a) is denied.\n\nC. Forum Non Conveniens\n\nIn the alternative, Defendant argues that this case should be dismissed because Delaware\nis a forum non conveniens for the parties under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). (D.I. 11 at 14-16) Section\n1404(a) gives district courts the authority to transfer venue \u201c[flor the convenience of parties and\nwitnesses, in the interests of justice . . . to any other district or division where it might have been\nbrought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). Defendant contends, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that this\naction could have been brought in the Southern District of Florida. (D.I. 11 at 15; D.L 16 at9\nn.1)\n\nIn the Third Circuit, courts are guided by the twelve public and private interest factors\nidentified in Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995). But when a valid\nforum selection clause applies to a dispute, the court does not consider arguments about the\n\nparties\u2019 private interests because these factors are deemed \u201cto weigh entirely in favor of the\npreselected forum.\u201d Atl. Marine, 571 U.S. at 64; see In re McGraw-Hill Global Education\nHoldings LLC, 909 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 2018). \u201cBecause [public interest] factors will rarely\ndefeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except\nin unusual cases.\u201d Atl. Marine, 571 U.S. at 64.\n\nPublic interest considerations under Jumara include (1) the enforceability of the\njudgment; (2) practical considerations that could make trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; (3)\nthe relative administrative difficulty in the two for a resulting from court congestion; (4) the local\ninterest in deciding local controversies at home; (5) the public policies of the fora; and (6) the\nfamiliarity of the trial judge with the applicable state law in diversity cases. Jumara, 55 F.3d at\n879-80. Defendant does not specifically address any of these public interest factors in support of\nits motion. Instead, Defendant argues that: (1) Plaintiffs lack a significant connection to\nDelaware; (2) key evidence and witnesses are located elsewhere; and (3) \u201call parties will be\ninconvenienced and quite possibly oppressed.\u201d (D.I. 11 at 15-16) These considerations are\ndirected to private interest factors such as the convenience of the parties, the convenience of the\nwitnesses, the location where the claim arose, and the location of books and records. Jumara, 55\nF.3d at 879. The Supreme Court has expressly rejected consideration of these factors when\nfaced with a forum selection clause because the parties \u201cwaive[d] the right to challenge the\npreselected forum as inconvenient or less convenient for themselves or their witnesses, or for\ntheir pursuit of the litigation.\u201d Az. Marine, 571 U.S. at 64 (noting that \u201c[o]nly that initial choice\ndeserves deference\u201d when the parties agreed by contract to bring suit in a specific forum).\n\nConsequently, Defendant\u2019s motion under \u00a7 1404(a) is denied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED. (D.I. 10)\nDefendant shall file an answer to the complaint within one week from the date of this\n\nMemorandum Opinion. An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nDated: March 8, 2022\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nVOUND COLORADO, LTD., and )\nVOUND, LLC, )\nPlaintiffs,\nv.
