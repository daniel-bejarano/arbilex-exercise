Pro Se Plaintiff. \nApril 14, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION cf:\u00a3-o[/};;{idge: \nPlaintiff Theresa Henderson appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis. (0.1. 4) She filed this action pursuant to the Fair Debt \nCollections Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 and the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n(FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681. (D.I. 2) She has also filed a motion for an injunction . (0.1. \n6) The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) . \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. \n2008). Plaintiff alleges violations of the FDCPA and the FCRA. She alleges that \nDefendants have continuously engaged in harassment, that she has a protected ADA \ndisability, and she has experienced great stress and mental anguish at the hands of \nDefendants. (0.1. 2 at 4) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have chosen to use frivolous \nlitigation as the tool of choice for harassment and they will not stop using the legal \nsystem to abuse her. (Id. at 4-5) The Complaint refers to ongoing litigation in the lower \nState courts, but it does not provide the case number or the court where the case is \nfiled. The Complaint contains numerous allegations regarding the acts of Defendants \nbut does not state when or where the acts occurred, other than to say they occurred \nwithin the last twelve months. (Id. at 7, 15-25) Finally, the Complaint refers to a \nnumber of documents , none of which are attached to the Complaint. \nPlaintiff seeks injunctive relief as well as actual and statutory damages . (Id. at \n26) \n1 II. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famig/io, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. \n2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take \nthem in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 \nF.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \n\"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal \npleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 \nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 \n(3d Cir. 2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an \"indisputably \nmeritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or delusional\" factual \nscenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523, \n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the Court \n2 must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be \ninequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in \nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court \nconcludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell \nAt/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations\" \nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \"labels and \nconclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Davis v. \nAbington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient \nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 \nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine \nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. \nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" that \n3 the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a}(2)). \nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nWhile this Court construes prose filings liberally, Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94, the \nComplaint fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted. It does not state when \nor where the alleged violations of the FDCPA and FCRA occurred, making it impossible \nfor Defendants to adequately respond to the pleading. It repeatedly refers to harassing \nlitigation but does not indicate where the alleged harassing case was filed and does not \nprovide a case name or number of the harassing case. \nIn addition, Plaintiff's claims of violations of the FDCPA and FRCA are \nconclusory. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (stating that a complaint will not suffice if it \n\"offers [merely] 'labels and conclusions\"' or \"'naked assertion[s]' devoid of 'further \nfactual enhancement'\"} (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555,557). Merely recitation of \nan element of a cause of action or a bare conclusory statement is insufficient to state a \nclaim. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Because the Complaint does not meet the pleading \nrequirements of Iqbal and Twombly, it will be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e}(2}(8}. Plaintiff, however, will be given leave to file an amended complaint. \nFinally, Plaintiff asks this Court to enjoin Defendants from using the lower courts \nto harass Plaintiff, but the relief requested would be impossible to grant given the \npaucity of facts alleged. (See D.I. 6) Therefore, the motion will be denied. \n4 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny the motion for an injunction {D.I. \n6); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915{e){2){B){ii). Plaintiff will \nbe given leave to amend. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nTHERESA HENDERSON, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nMIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT, \net al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 21-1551-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 14th day of April in 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1.
