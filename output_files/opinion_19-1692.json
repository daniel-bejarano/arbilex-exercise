Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nRyan Patrick Connell, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 31, 2023\nWilmington, Delaware\nwhl Gs bork tpn\n\nPlaintiff James R. Fenton, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\n(\u2018JTVCC\u2019) in Smyrna, Delaware, proceeding pro se, filed this action pursuant to the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, et seq., alleging disability\ndiscrimination during the parole process. (D.I. 1). Before the Court are Defendants\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment and Plaintiffs motion to strike, motion to compel, and\nmotion for default judgment. (D.1. 53, 56, 73, 75). The motion for summary judgment\nand motion to strike are fully briefed.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nFollowing a conviction for first-degree rape and other charges arising from his\nand his co-defendant\u2019s repeated rape of his ex-fianc\u00e9, Plaintiff was sentenced to life in\nprison. (D.I. 70-1 at 4, 8, 13). Plaintiff has been an inmate at the JTVCC since July\n1984. (Id. at 1). Plaintiff has been eligible for parole since July 20, 2004. (D.I. 1 at 2).\nHe has schizophrenia and receives medication by injection twice per month to treat the\ncondition. (D.I. 54-2 at 4). He has had no disciplinary problems since 2013, and he has\nnot received any write ups, major or non-major, since 2009. (D.I. 1 at 2; D.1. 70-1 at\n22). The Delaware Department of Correction (\"DDOC\u201d) Multi-Disciplinary Team at\nJTVCC has recommended Plaintiff for parole three times. (D.I. 69 at 3).\n\nOn September 14, 2017, the State of Delaware Board of Parole (\u201cthe Board\u201d), via\na letter signed by Defendant David Henderson, the Chairperson of the Board, denied\nPlaintiffs request to be released to parole supervision. (D.I. 1-1 at 1). The letter stated\n\nthat the Board had considered Plaintiff's \u201ctestimony, institutional records,\n\nassessmenis/evaluations, prior criminal history, and program participation,\u201d and had\nconcluded that he continued to pose a risk to the community. (/d.). The Board\nrecommended that Plaintiff work with his counselor and Connections to develop a plan\ndesigned to provide Plaintiff an appropriate transition to the community that contained\nlong-term housing options and mental health treatment. (/d.). Plaintiff fulfilled the\nrequest, and, on December 19, 2018, the Board advised him in another letter signed by\nHenderson that the Board had deferred a decision in his case and was requesting that\nthe DDOC provide the Board with an extensive mental health evaluation and an ABEL\nassessment.\u2019 (D.I. 1 at 1-2; D.I. 1-1 at 2). On June 12, 2019, in a third letter signed by\nHenderson, the Board again denied parole, citing its conclusion that Plaintiff continued\nto pose a risk to the community, based on the same considerations from the September\n2017 letter. (D.I. 1-1 at 3). The Board recommended that Plaintiff \u201cwork with [his]\ncounselor to develop a plan for continued mental health programming/counseling and\nvictim empathy programs.\u201d (/d.). Plaintiff was advised that he would be eligible to\nreapply for parole consideration at any time after the expiration of forty-eight months;\nthat is June 2023. (/d.). Plaintiff alleges that the Board intentionally denied him parole\nin violation of the ADA due to his schizophrenia. (D.I. 1 at 2).\n\nDefendants moved for dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6) on the grounds that the claims against the Board are barred by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment, and that the Complaint failed to plead a plausible disability discrimination\n\n1 The ABEL assessment is \u201can objective measure of sexual interest and is used to\ndetermine the risk a sex offender presents to the community.\u201d (D.1. 54-1 at 3).\n\n2\n\nclaim. (D.I. 27). | denied the motion, holding that the Board was not immune to\nPlaintiffs ADA claim and that Plaintiff had adequately alleged an ADA claim. (D.I. 36,\n37). In explaining that Plaintiff's allegations survived dismissal, | explained:\n\nTitle Il of the ADA provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a\ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation\nin or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n12132. Plaintiff's allegations that he has schizophrenia bring him within the\ndefinition of an individual with a disability. In addition, the Complaint pleads\nenough facts to show that Plaintiff was otherwise qualified for parole, having\nbeen eligible since 2004, recommended for parole three time[s] by the\nClassification Board, and completed a transition plan as requested by the\nBoard.\n\nBoth times when the Board denied Plaintiff parole, it recommended\nthat Plaintiff work with his counselor and Connections to develop a transition\nplan for mental health treatment/programming/counseling. (D.I. 1-1 at 1, 3).\nWhile the denial decisions do not expressly state that the Board based the\ndenials on schizophrenia, that point is not dispositive at the pleading stage.\nSee Taylor v. Henderson, 632 F. App\u2019x 70, 75 (3d Cir. 2015) (citing and\nquoting Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 896 n.3 (9th Cir. 2002) \u201c(\u2018[While\nthe 1999 Board decision does not disclose the Board's reliance on\nThompson\u2019s history of substance abuse, the decision does not affirmatively\nprove that the Board did not\u2019 rely on it.).\u201d Indeed, the 2017 and 2019 Board\ndecisions suggest that the Board may have considered Plaintiff's\nschizophrenia given that both recommend Plaintiff, with his counselor,\ndevelop mental health treatment/programming/counseling plans. /d.\n\n(D.I. 36 at 5).\n\nDefendants now move for summary judgment, arguing that that there is no\ngenuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff's schizophrenia was not the sole reason for\nthe denial of his parole request, but, rather, that the record evidence establishes that he\nwas denied parole based on his commission of a serious sexual offense, the risk that he\nwould reoffend, and the Board\u2019s conclusion that he continues to pose a risk to the\n\ncommunity. (D.]. 53, 54). As evidence, Defendants provided a mental health evaluation\n3\nthe Board received from mental health clinician Robert Gingrich, which included an\n\u201cAnalysis of Risk\u201d section that described Plaintiffs ABEL Assessment, lowa Sex\nOffender Risk Assessment (\u201cISORA\u2019), and Sexual Violence Risk-20 (\u201cSVR-20\u201d)\nassessment. (D.|. 54-2). Gingrich\u2019s evaluation recounted that Plaintiff \u201cattempted to\nmanipulate the ABEL assessment by not rating the question section of the evaluation,\u201d\nand \u201c[a]s a result, numerous scales could not be completed.\u201d (/d. at 5). He had a \u201cvery\nproblematic\u201d \u201csocial desirability score,\u201d and \u201calso scored at high risk of exhibitionism,\nvoyeurism, and fetishes.\u201d (/d. at 5). His scores placed him \u201cin the severe danger risk.\u201d\n(Id. at 6). His scores on the ISORA and the SVR-20 placed him at \u201cmoderate-high risk.\u201d\n(Id.).\n\nIn Gingrich\u2019s explanations of the three assessments described above, he made\nno mention, even implicitly, of Plaintiffs schizophrenia diagnosis. The 5-page\nevaluation mentioned Plaintiffs schizophrenia diagnosis directly once, and indirectly a\nsecond time. In a \u201cHistory of Treatment\u201d section, Gingrich noted that Plaintiff receives\n\u201c200 mg. by injection of Haldol twice per month to treat his diagnosis of schizophrenia.\u201d\n(/d. at 4). In the \u201cRecommendations\u201d section, Gingrich noted that if Plaintiff were\nparoled, \u201c[iJt would be critical that he receive his 200 mg. of Haldol twice monthly.\u201d (/d.\nat 6).\n\nDefendants also submitted a sworn declaration from Defendant Henderson,\nstating that the Board\u2019s conclusion that there is a continued risk to the community\ngenerally leads to the deniai of a parole request. (D.I. 54-1 at 2). Henderson stated\n\nthat, \u201c[i]In many cases, . . . mental health issues played a role in the violent behavior that\n\n4\nresulted in the prison sentence that the offenders are seeking to be paroled from,\u201d and,\n\u201cWhile the Board does not hold the existence of mental illness against offenders, the\nBoard does examine whether an offender\u2019s mental illness has been controlled (and\nwhether it\u2019s controlled to the point of not posing a risk to the community), whether an\noffender is cooperating with the prison mental health provider, and whether an offender\nhas a plan or ability to tend to his/her mental health following release from DOC\ncustody.\u201d (/d.). Henderson further explained that the Board\u2019s December 2018 request\nfor a mental health assessment was meant to determine the risk of Plaintiff reoffending,\nand he noted that Gingrich\u2019s evaluation provided the Board with the three risk-factor\nassessments discussed above. (/d. at 3). Finally, Henderson stated that the Board\ndenied Plaintiff's parole request in June 2019 \u201cdue to a number of factors including the\nfact that the Board deemed him to be a risk to the community\u201d; that the Board\nendeavors to provide \u201caction steps\u201d and offender can take to improve their chances of\nparole in the future; that following those action steps may improve the offender's\nchances but does not guarantee the grant of parole; which decision will again be based\non the risk the offender poses to the community, as well other factors, including whether\n\u201cthe offender has a plan/ability to successfully transition back into the community.\u201d (/d.).\nPlaintiff filed a response to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, sworn\nunder penalty of perjury, in which he heavily relied on my opinion denying Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss to argue that | should also deny summary judgment. (D.1. 55).\nPlaintiff also challenged the validity of the ABEL Assessment and the SVR-20 as\n\nassessment tools. (/d. at 2). Additionally, he argued that Gingrich\u2019s evaluation should\n\nbe stricken from the record because it was not signed under penalty of perjury and\ncontained hearsay where it described the ABEL Assessment given that Gingrich did not\nadminister the assessment and did not provide an affidavit from the individual who did\nadminister it. (/d. at 5). Plaintiff filed a separate motion to strike Gingrich\u2019s evaluation\nfor the same reasons. (D.I. 56).\n\nPlaintiff was thereafter given additional time to conduct discovery, and both\nparties were advised that they could file supplements to the motion for summary\njudgment or opposition, should they deem them necessary. (D.I. 59, 60). Defendants\nfiled responses to Plaintiff's interrogatories and document requests, answering some of\nthe interrogatories, objecting to others, producing some of the requested documents,\nand objecting to others. (D.I. 69, 70).\n\nNeither party filed supplements, but Plaintiff filed a motion to compel, requesting\nthat | overrule Defendants\u2019 objections (D.I. 73), and a motion for default judgment (D.I.\n75) for failure to provide the requested discovery.\n\nil. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 56(c) requires the court to \u201cgrant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\" The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v.\nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986). The burden then shifts to the\nnonmoving party to show that there is a \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986).\n\nA fact in dispute is material when it \"might affect the outcome of the suit under\nthe governing law\" and is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could\nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 248 (1986). \"In considering a motion for summary judgment, a district court may\nnot make credibility determinations or engage in any weighing of the evidence; instead,\nthe nonmoving party's evidence \u2018is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be\ndrawn in his favor.\u201d Marino v. Industrial Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004)\n(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255). A court's role in deciding a motion for summary\njudgment is not to evaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the matter but rather \"to\ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.\n\nWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to\n\nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d The mere\n\nexistence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat\n\nan otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the\n\nrequirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact. When\n\nopposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly\n\ncontradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a\n\ncourt should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\nScott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (citations, quotations, and alterations omitted).\nlll. DISCUSSION\n\nTo establish a violation of Title Il of the ADA, Plaintiff must demonstrate that he\n(i) is a person with a disability as defined by the ADA; (ii) is otherwise qualified for the\nbenefit in question (parole); and (iii) that he was excluded from the benefit due to\n\ndiscrimination based upon disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; Talley v. Supreme Court of\n\nPa., 2022 WL 1701849, at *1 (3d Cir. May 27, 2022) (per curiam); Taylor v. Delaware\n\n7\nBd. of Parole, 2017 WL 1536192, at *3 (D. Del. Apr. 26, 2017). The Ninth Circuit has\nrecognized:\nTitle I| does not categorically bar a state parole board from making an\nindividualized assessment of the future dangerousness of an inmate by\ntaking into account the inmate's disability. Title Il only prohibits\ndiscrimination against \"qualified\" people with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n(defining a qualified person with a disability as a person who \"meets the\nessential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services\"). A person's\ndisability that leads one to a propensity to commit crime may certainly be\nrelevant in assessing whether that individual is qualified for parole.\nThompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 898 n.4 (9th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added). In\nThompson, the relevant disability was substance abuse, and the court \u201ch[e]ld only that\nplaintiffs may state a claim under Title II based on their allegations that the parole board\nfailed to perform an individualized assessment of the threat they pose to the community\nby categorically excluding from consideration for parole all people with substance abuse\nhistories.\u201d /d.?\nAssuming, arguendo, that Plaintiffs schizophrenia diagnosis constitutes a\ndisability under the ADA,\u00b0 | conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact on\n\nthis record that Defendants\u2019 denial of Plaintiffs parole request was not based solely\n\nupon his schizophrenia diagnosis, but rather was based on an individualized\n\n2 The Third Circuit has cited Thompson with approval. See Taylor v. Henderson, 632 F.\nApp\u2019x 70, 75 & n.4 (3d Cir. 2015) (per curiam).\n\n3 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs schizophrenia diagnosis does not constitute a\ndisability under the ADA in the context of this case because he \u201chas not shown that he\nis actually disabled as defined by the ADA, in that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that [Plaintiffs]\nschizophrenia currently limits one or more major life activity.\u201d (D.I. 54 at 4-5). Ido not\nneed to decide this issue to rule on the motion for summary judgment and, accordingly,\n| do not.\n\n8\n\nassessment of the risk he posed to the community. Indeed, the record suggests that\nperhaps the biggest factor in the decision to deny parole was the fact that three risk\nassessments placed Plaintiff at moderate-high risk to severe danger risk. As noted,\nGingrich\u2019s evaluation containing these assessments hardly referenced Plaintiff's\nschizophrenia diagnosis and certainly did not rely on it any meaningful way. For these\nreasons, Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment will be granted.*\nIV. MISCELLANEOUS MOTIONS\n\nDefendants\u2019 objections to Plaintiff's discovery requests will be sustained, and\nPlaintiff's motion to compel (D.I. 73) will be denied, as most of the unsatisfied\ninterrogatories and documents requests are irrelevant to his ADA claim. Plaintiff's\nmotion for default judgment (D.I. 75) will be denied for essentially the same reason.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nBased upon the above discussion, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment (D.I. 53); and (2) deny Plaintiff's motion to strike, motion to compel,\nand motion for defauit judgment (D.1. 56, 73, 75).\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n4 Plaintiff's motion to strike (D.1. 56) will be denied. The relevance of Gingrich\u2019s\nevaluation was that it was considered by the Board in denying his parole request.\nPlaintiffs hearsay and authentication concerns are irrelevant in this context.\n\n9\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nJAMES R.
