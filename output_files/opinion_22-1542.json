Civil Action No. 22-1542-CFC\nBRIAN EMIG, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\need\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nIn November 2022, Petitioner David Michell filed papers contending that: (1) his\nviolation of probation sentence was not properly credited with the time he served in\ncustody from September 1, 2021 to October 20, 2021 while awaiting his violation-of-\nprobation hearing (D.I. 2 at 10); (2) the Superior Court judge imposed excessive bail\n(D.I 2 at 5, 8); and (3) the Superior Court judge presiding over his case engaged in\nmisconduct by yelling and ignoring Petitioner's right to face his accusers (D.I. 2. at 7).\nThe Petition indicates that \u201call charges during [Petitioner's] probation period have been\ndropped except a criminal trespassing charge that is still pending.\u201d (/d. at 5) For relief,\nPetitioner asks to have all pending charges and his probation conviction dismissed, to\nbe immediately released, to be compensated for his incarceration, and to have the state\ncourt judge who presided over his violation of probation hearing attend anger\n\nmanagement training. (D.!. 2 at 12)\nUpon initial review of Petitioner's filing, the Court recognized that requests for\nmonetary damages and requests to require anger management training for state court\njudges are not properly asserted in a habeas proceeding. (D.I. 4 at 2 n.1)\nNevertheless, the Court liberally construed Petitioner's filing to be a petition seeking\nfederal habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because his other allegations\nchallenged the legality of his custody. (D.I. 4 at 2 &n.1) The Court issued an initial\nAEDPA Order explaining Petitioner's rights under \u00a7 2254, provided an AEDPA Election\nForm with options for Petitioner to indicate how he wished to proceed, and provided\nPetitioner with a form \u00a7 2254 application so that he could clarify his intentions. (D.I. 4)\n\nA federal district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \u201cif it plainly\nappears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is\nnot entitled to relief.\u201d' Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. Importantly, a petitioner is not\nentitled to federal habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 unless he has exhausted state remedies\nfor his habeas claims by \u201cfairly presenting\u201d the substance of the claims to the state\u2019s\nhighest court, either on direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, and in a\nprocedural manner permitting the state courts to consider them on the merits. See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A); Duncan v. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 365 (1995); Lambert v.\nBlackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n\u2018As a general rule, habeas petitions filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 must be filed\nwithin one year of the petitioner's judgment of conviction becoming final. See 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Petitioner is responsible for determining the events that trigger and toll\nthe limitations period.\nTo date, Petitioner has not filed the AEDPA Election Form or a completed form\n\u00a7 2254 application. Instead, on January 26, 2023, Petitioner filed an Exhibit in Support\nof his claim for proper sentence credit (D.I. 5) and a letter and exhibit indicating that he\nhas a proceeding pending in the Delaware courts for return of property and \u201ctwo\nmotions for time previously served\u201d that have been pending for months (D.1. 6 at 2-3;\nD.I. 6-1).\n\nAccording to the Delaware Inmate Locator, Petitioner was released on probation\nor parole on February 6, 2023, and his custody status is listed as \u201csupervised custody.\u201d\nSee https://vinelink. vineapps.com/person-detail/offender/25006560;tabIndexToSelect=0\nIn other words, Petitioner has obtained one form of relief he requested (immediate\nrelease), and Petitioner's additional filing in January 2023 indicates that he is attempting\nto exhaust state remedies for at least one ground for relief in his Petition. Given these\ncircumstances, the Court could summarily dismiss the Petition as moot (due to the fact\nthat Petitioner obtained the relief requested (immediate release)) and/or as\nunexhausted (due to Petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust his remaining proper grounds for\nhabeas relief). Nevertheless, the Court will exercise prudence and provide Petitioner\nwith one more opportunity to file a completed form \u00a7 2254 application clarifying his\nclaims and indicating whether he has exhausted state remedies for all grounds for relief.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, at Wilmington this Fifth day of April 2023;\n\nIT IS ORDERED that Petitioner shall have twenty-eight days from the entry of\n\nthis Order to file a completed form \u00a7 2254 application and a completed AEDPA Election\nForm. Failure to comply with this deadline will result in summary dismissal for failure to\n\nprosecute.\n\nColm F.
