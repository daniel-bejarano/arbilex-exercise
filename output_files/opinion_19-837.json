JOBES,\n\nPetitioner,\nVv. : Civil Action No. 19-837-GBW\nTRUMAN MEARS, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\nRespondents.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION!\n\nEdward A. Jobes. Pro Se Petitioner.\n\nElizabeth R. McFarlan, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Respondents.\n\nSeptember 30, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\n'This case was reassigned to the undersigned\u2019s docket on September 7, 2022.\nWN. Judge:\n\nWilliams,\n\nPresently pending before the Court is a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 filed by Petitioner Edward A. Jobes. (D.I. 3) The\nState filed an Answer in opposition. (D.I. 10) For the reasons discussed, the Court\nwill deny the Petition.\n\nI BACKGROUND\n\n[Petitioner] was arrested on October 8, 2015 and charged\nwith one count of Rape in the Third Degree. The\ninvestigation arose after a witness revealed to her\ncounselor that [Petitioner], who was 34 years old, had\nengaged in sexual intercourse with the 14 year old victim.\nThe victim was interviewed at the Children's Advocacy\nCenter but she was unable to discuss what had transpired\nwith [Petitioner]. Due to the passage of time between the\ndate of the offense and the disclosure, a SANE [Sexual\nAssault Nurse Examiner] kit could not be collected from\nthe victim. A search warrant was executed on\n[Petitioner\u2019s] house and a computer tower, two cell\nphones, and photographs were seized. Subsequently,\n[Petitioner] was taken to Delaware State Police Troop 3\nfor questioning. Prior to the interrogation Detective\nShawn Doherty read [Petitioner] his Miranda rights,\nwhich he waived. During his statement, [Petitioner]\nadmitted that the victim was his second cousin and that he\ncommunicated with her over the \u201cKIK\u201d which is a cell\nphone app. The Affidavit of Probable cause states\n[Petitioner] told the police that he and the victim\ncommunicated through computer and cell phone apps.\nAfter initially denying inappropriate contact, [Petitioner]\nclaimed that the victim came onto him, he became\nsexually aroused and consequently he engaged in sexual\nintercourse with her. He described the act in great detail,\nincluding physical positioning and the sequence of events.\n[Petitioner] stated that the sex act occurred on the couch in\nhis shed.\n\nState v. Jobes, 2017 WL 5075380, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 26, 2017).\n\nPetitioner was indicted on December 7, 2015 for third degree rape. (D.I. 11-11 at\n20) On February 24, 2016, Petitioner pled guilty to the lesser-included offense of\nfourth degree rape. (D.I. 11-11 at 21) The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner on\nMay 24, 2016 to fifteen years of Level V incarceration, suspended after four years\nfor decreasing levels of supervision. (See D.I. 11-11 at 47) Petitioner did not file a\ndirect appeal.\n\nOn July 8, 2016, Petitioner filed a pro se motion for modification of\nsentence. (D.I. 11-1 at Entry No. 10) The Superior Court summarily denied the\nmotion on July 15, 2016, and Petitioner did not appeal that decision. (See D.I. 10\nat 2)\n\nOn July 18, 2016, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a pro se motion for\npost-conviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61\n(\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d). (D.I. 11-1 at Entry No. 12); see Jobes, 2017 WL 5075380, at\n*1. In October 2017, a Delaware Superior Court Commissioner issued a report\nrecommending the denial of Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion. See id. at *4. The\nSuperior Court adopted the Report and Recommendation in September 2018 and\n\ndenied the Rule 61 motion. See State v. Jobes, 2018 WL 4507651, at *1 (Del.\n\n2\nSuper. Ct. Jan. 11, 2018). The Superior Court reissued the order on September 18,\n2018 because Petitioner had not received timely notice of the January order. See\nState v. Jobes, 2018 WL 4507651 at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 19, 2018). The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment on February 25,\n2018. See Jobes v. State, 206 A.3d 261 (Table), 2019 WL 949374, at *2 (Del. Feb.\n25, 2019).\nIl. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal\nsentences . . . and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal\ncourt may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground\nthat he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Additionally, AEDPA imposes procedural\nrequirements and standards for analyzing the merits of a habeas petition in order to\n\u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state-court convictions are\ngiven effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 693\n\n(2002).\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999);\nPicard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\n\nshall not be granted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in\nthe courts of the State; or\n\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\n\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such\n\nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of\ncomity, gives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues\nby invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review\nprocess.\u201d O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192\n(3d Cir. 2000).\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\n\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\n\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the\n\ncourt to consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451\n\n4\nn.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). Ifthe petitioner raised\nthe issue on direct appeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted\nand the petitioner does not need to raise the same issue again in a state post-\nconviction proceeding. See Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir.\n1997).\n\nIfa petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and\nfurther state court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the\nfederal court will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted.\nSee Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[]\nthe technical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer\navailable); see also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims,\nhowever, are procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v.\nLarkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a\nhabeas claim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d\nrefuses to review the merits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state\nprocedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman,\n501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\n\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will\n5\nresult if the court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172\nF.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause\nfor a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor\nexternal to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate\nactual prejudice, a petitioner must show that the errors during his trial created more\nthan a possibility of prejudice; he must show that the errors worked to his actual\nand substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional\ndimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d? then a federal\ncourt can excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of\njustice exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means\nfactual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n614, 623 (1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual\n\ninnocence by asserting \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpato\nry ig patory\n\n2Murray, 477 US. at 496.\nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical\nevidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d showing that no reasonable juror would\nhave voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Hubbard v.\nPinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nC. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted\nif the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn,\n250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d\nfor the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision finally resolved the claim\non the basis of its substance, rather than on a procedural or some other ground. See\nThomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7\n2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by an opinion\nexplaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86,\n\n98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit may be presumed that the state\n7\ncourt adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-\nlaw procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d Id. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that\nthe state court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\nThis presumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of\nfact, and is only rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7\n2254(e)(1); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard\nin \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application\nstandard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nThe timely-filed Petition asserts the following five Claims: (1) the police\nfailed to provide Petitioner with a copy of the search warrant for his cell phone and\ncomputer; (2) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by prosecuting\nPetitioner without forensic or physical evidence; (3) defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to conduct an \u201cadequate investigation\u201d and\n\u201cperform dut[ies]\u201d Petitioner requested; (4) Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights and\nhis right to due process were violated when (a) the police entered his house without\na search warrant; and (b) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance; and (5)\n\nthe police engaged in misconduct because the victim stated in her report to the\n\n-\nChild Advocacy Center that she never had sex with Petitioner.\n\nA. Claims One and Four (a): Fourth Amendment Violations\n\nIn Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a\nfederal court cannot review a Fourth Amendment claim if the petitioner had a full\nand fair opportunity to litigate the claim in the state court. See also Wright v. West,\n505 U.S. 277, 293 (1992). A petitioner is considered to have had a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate such claims if the state has an available mechanism for\nsuppressing evidence seized in or tainted by an illegal search or seizure,\nirrespective of whether the petitioner actually availed himself of that mechanism.\nSee U.S. ex rel. Hickey v. Jeffes, 571 F.2d 762, 766 (3d Cir. 1978); Boyd v. Mintz,\n631 F.2d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 1980). Conversely, a petitioner has not had a full and\nfair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, and therefore avoids the\nStone bar, if the state system contains a structural defect that prevented the state\ncourt from fully and fairly hearing the petitioner's Fourth Amendment argument.\nSee Marshall v. Hendricks, 307 F.3d 36, 82 (3d Cir. 2002). Notably, \u201can erroneous\nor summary resolution by a state court of a Fourth Amendment claim does not\novercome the [Stone] bar.\u201d Id.\n\nClaims One and Four (a) assert that the police violated Petitioner\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment rights by conducting a search and seizing evidence without a warrant.\n\nAlthough Petitioner did not file a motion to suppress, Rule 41 of the Delaware\n9\nSuperior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides a mechanism for filing a\npretrial motion to suppress evidence in Delaware state criminal proceedings. See\nWright v. Pierce, 82 F. Supp. 3d 558, 567 (D. Del. 2015). Nothing in the record\nindicates that Petitioner was prevented from filing a Rule 41 suppression motion,\nand Petitioner actually did present the instant Fourth Amendment argument in his\nRule 61 motion and on post-conviction appeal. Consequently, the Court concludes\nthat Petitioner was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth\nAmendment claims in the Delaware state courts. Accordingly, the Fourth\nAmendment arguments in Claims One and Four (a) are barred by Stone.\n\nB. Claims Three and Four (b): Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing the arguments Petitioner raised in his Rule 61 proceeding?\n\n3In his Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by: (1) failing to consult with him; (2) misleading him about the\nevidence; (3) failing to object to the videotaped police statement; (4) failing to\nprovide him with discovery materials; (5) failing to object to the admission of\nPetitioner\u2019s juvenile record during sentencing; and (6) failing to get the digital\nevidence \u201ctossed.\u201d (D.I. 11-3 at 4) On post-conviction appeal, Petitioner argued\nthat defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by: (1) failing to file a timely\nmotion to suppress lineup identification evidence; (2) failing to file a timely\nmotion to suppress illegally seized evidence; and (3) failing to request a hearing\npursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) in order to challenge the\nwarrant. (D.I. 11-9 at 8) In the instant Petition, Petitioner perfunctorily asserts\nthat defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to conduct an\nadequate investigation (Claim Three), failing to perform duties Petitioner asked to\nbe performed (Claim Three), and failing to pursue the issue of the warrantless\nsearch of his house and the ensuing illegal search and seizure (Claim Four (b)).\n\n(DI. 1 at 8-10)\n10\nin conjunction with the arguments raised in the instant Petition, the Court liberally\nconstrues Claims Three and Four (b) as contending that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by failing to conduct an adequate investigation, failing to\nreview the discovery materials with Petitioner, and failing to file a motion to\nsuppress the evidence seized by the police. Petitioner presented these arguments in\nhis Rule 61 motion, which the Superior Court denied as meritless. See Jobes,\n2018, 4507651, at *3. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision. See\nJobes, 2019 WL 949374, at *2. Given these circumstances, Petitioner will only be\nentitled to habeas relief if the Delaware state court decisions\u2018 were either contrary\nto, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539\n\nU.S. 510 (2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate\n\n\u201cBecause the Superior Court provides a more in-depth analysis of Petitioner\u2019s\ninstant ineffective assistance of counsel Claims, the Court will refer to both state\ncourt decisions when reviewing these Claims. See Wilson v. Sellers, 138 S. Ct.\n1188, 1193-94 (2018) (reiterating that when a higher court affirms a lower court\u2019s\njudgment without an opinion or other explanation, federal habeas law employs a\n\u201clook through\u201d presumption and assumes that the later unexplained order\nupholding a lower court\u2019s reasoned judgment rests upon the same grounds as the\nlower court judgment).\n\n11\nthat \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d\nwith reasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time\ncounsel rendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second\nStrickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s error the result would have been different.\u201d Id.\nat 687-96. A reasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine\nconfidence in the outcome.\u201d Jd. at 688. In the context of a guilty plea, a petitioner\nsatisfies Strickland\u2019 s prejudice prong by demonstrating that, but for counsel's error,\nthere is a reasonable probability that he would have insisted on proceeding to trial\ninstead of pleading guilty. See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). A court\nmany deny an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by only deciding one of the\nStrickland prongs. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697.\n\nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner\nmust make concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk\nsummary dismissal. See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991);\nDooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not\ninsurmountable, the Strickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \u201cstrong\npresumption that the representation was professionally reasonable.\u201d Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 689.\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that\n12\nthe Delaware state courts correctly articulated the Strickland/Hill standard as\ngoverning Petitioner\u2019s instant ineffective assistance of counsel contentions.\u2019 Asa\nresult, the decisions were not contrary to clearly established Supreme Court\nprecedent. See Fahy v. Horn, 516 F.3d 169, 196 (3d Cir. 2008) (Supreme Court of\nPennsylvania's decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established Federal law\nbecause appropriately relied on its own state court cases, which articulated the\nproper standard derived from Supreme Court precedent); Williams, 529 U.S. at\n406 (\u201c[A] run-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from\n[Supreme Court] cases to the facts of a prisoner's case [does] not fit comfortably\nwithin \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause\u201d).\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware state courts reasonably\napplied the Strickland/Hill standard to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case. When\nperforming this inquiry, the Court must review the courts\u2019 denial of Petitioner\u2019s\nineffective assistance of counsel allegations through a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens.\nSee Harrington, 562 U.S. at 105-06. \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's\nactions were reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument\n\nthat counsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d Id. When assessing\n\n5The Superior Court and the Delaware Supreme Court cited to Strickland without\nciting Hill. Nevertheless, the standard they articulated correctly stated the standard\nset forth in both Strickland and Hill.\n\n13\nprejudice under Strickland, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the\nresult would have been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s performance, and the\n\u201clikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d Id. And\nfinally, when viewing a state court\u2019s determination that a Strickland claim lacks\nmerit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as\nfairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d\nId. at 101.\n\nThe Superior Court provided the following explanation for denying\nPetitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel arguments:\n\n[I]t is abundantly clear that [Petitioner] has failed to allege\nany facts sufficient to substantiate his claim that his\nattorney was ineffective. I find trial counsel's affidavit, in\nconjunction with the record, more credible that\n[Petitioner\u2019s] self-serving claims that his counsel's\nrepresentation was ineffective. [Petitioner\u2019s] counsel\nclearly denies the allegations.\n\n[Petitioner] was facing the possibility of a minimum\nmandatory sentence for a potentially very long period of\nincarceration. As a result of pleading to the lesser included\noffense and having an open sentencing, [Petitioner] had\nthe possibility of receiving a sentence with little or no time\nincarcerated, and the sentence and plea were reasonable\nunder all the circumstances, especially in light of his\nconfession. Prior to the entry of the plea, [Petitioner] and\nhis attorney discussed the case. The plea bargain was\nclearly advantageous to [Petitioner]. Counsel's\nrepresentation was certainly well within the range required\nby Strickland. Additionally, when [Petitioner] entered his\nguilty plea, he stated he was satisfied with defense\n\n14\ncounsel's performance. He is bound by his statement\nunless he presents clear and convincing evidence to the\ncontrary. Consequently, [Petitioner] has failed to establish\nthat his counsel's representation was ineffective under the\nStrickland test.\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that counsel's representation of\n[Petitioner] was somehow deficient, [Petitioner] must\nsatisfy the second prong of the Strickland test, prejudice.\nIn setting forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\na defendant must make concrete allegations of actual\nprejudice and substantiate them or risk dismissal. In an\nattempt to show prejudice, [Petitioner] simply asserts that\nhis counsel was ineffective. His statements are insufficient\nto establish prejudice, particularly in light of the evidence\nagainst him. Therefore, I find [Petitioner\u2019s] grounds for\nrelief are meritless.\n\nJobes, 2017 WL 5075380, at *3-4. The Superior Court also held that Petitioner\nwas bound by the statements he made during the plea colloquy and that Petitioner\n\u201centered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Jd. at *4.\n\nWhen affirming the Superior Court\u2019s denial of Claims Three and Four (a),\nthe Delaware Supreme Court opined:\n\nIn this case, [Petitioner\u2019s] claims of ineffective assistance\nof counsel are not supported by the record. The evidence\nagainst [Petitioner] included his confession to the police\nthat he engaged in sexual conduct with a fourteen-year-old\ngirl. If [Petitioner] had gone to trial on the charge of Rape\nThird Degree, which is a Class B felony, he risked the\nimposition of a prison sentence of at least two years and\nup to twenty-five years. By pleading guilty to Rape Fourth\nDegree, which is a Class C felony, he ensured a much\nlower maximum term of incarceration and eliminated the\nminimum term of incarceration. Under these\n\n15\ncircumstances, [Petitioner] cannot demonstrate a\n\nreasonable probability that the outcome of his case would\n\nhave been better for him if he had gone to trial rather than\n\nenter into a plea agreement. We therefore conclude, as did\n\nthe Superior Court, that the claim of ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel is without merit.\nJobes, 2019 WL 949374, at *2. In addition, after reviewing the transcript of the\nguilty plea, the Delaware Supreme Court held that Petitioner was \u201cbound by his\nsworn representations during the guilty plea colloquy\u201d and, therefore, concluded\nthat Petitioner had \u201centered his plea knowing, intelligently, and voluntarily.\u201d Jd. at\n*3.\n\nIt is well-settled that \u201c[s]olemn declarations in open court carry a strong\npresumption of verity [creating a] formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral\nproceedings.\u201d See Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 74 (1977). In this case, the\ntranscript of Petitioner's plea colloquy contains his clear and explicit statements\nthat he had discussed his case with defense counsel, that he was satisfied with his\ncounsel's representation, and that he committed the crimes to which he was\npleading guilty. (D.I. 11-2 at 6, 8-9) Notably, when asked if defense counsel\ndiscussed the \u201cevidence in [his] case [and] any defenses [he] believe[d] he may\nhave [had]\u201d and whether he had the opportunity to \u201cask any questions so that [he]\n\nunderstood what [he was] doing\u201d by pleading guilty, Petitioner answered \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n(DI. 11-2 at 8-9) The Truth-In-Sentencing Guilty Plea Form signed by Petitioner\n\n16\nalso indicates that he knowingly and voluntarily entered into his plea agreement;\nhe had not been promised anything not contained in the plea agreement; he was not\nforced or threatened to enter the plea agreement; and he was satisfied with his\nlawyer's representation. (D.I. 11-6 at 7) In this proceeding, Petitioner has failed to\nprovide any evidence as to why the statements he made during the plea colloquy\nshould not be presumptively accepted as true. Thus, the Court concludes that the\nDelaware courts reasonably applied Blackledge in holding that Petitioner was\nbound by the representations he made during the plea colloquy concerning the\nadequacy of defense counsel\u2019s performance and the voluntariness of his plea.\u00ae\n\nThe statements Petitioner made during the plea colloquy belie his present\nallegations that defense counsel performed deficiently by failing to conduct an\nadequate investigation and failing to review the discovery materials with him.\nAdditionally, defense counsel\u2019s Rule 61 affidavits belie all three of Petitioner\u2019s\nineffective assistance allegations. In her affidavits, defense counsel explains that:\n(1) she reviewed the discovery responses with Petitioner, which included the\n\nvictim\u2019s statement and Petitioner\u2019s police statement; (2) Petitioner only agreed to\n\n6 Although the Delaware state courts did not cite Blackledge when determining the\nvoluntariness of Petitioner's guilty plea, the Delaware cases to which the courts\ncited \u2014 Palmer v. State, 810 A.2d 530 (Table), 2002 WL 31546531 (Del. Nov. 13,\n2002) and Somerville v. State, 703 A.2d 629, 632 (Del. 1997) \u2014 did cite to\n\nBlackledge.\n17\nenter the plea after he had an opportunity to ask counsel questions; and (3) she did\nnot send the discovery to the prison due to the sensitive nature of the allegations\nand the lack of privacy at the prison. (D.I. 11-4 at 1-2; D.I. 11-5 at 1-2) Defense\ncounsel also explains that \u201cno meritorious basis existed for filing a motion to\nsuppress [Petitioner\u2019s] recorded statement, which was provided to the police\nfollowing [Petitioner] being read and waiving his Miranda rights.\u201d (D.I. 11-4 at 1)\nThe Delaware state courts found defense counsel\u2019s affidavits to be more credible\nthan Petitioner\u2019s allegations and, since Petitioner has not provided any clear and\nconvincing evidence in this proceeding to rebut that factual finding, the Court\ndefers to that determination. For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that\nPetitioner has failed to satisfy the performance prong of the Strickland/Hill\nstandard.\n\nPetitioner has also failed to satisfy the prejudice prong of the Strickland\nstandard. To begin, Petitioner does not assert that he would have proceeded to trial\nif not for defense counsel\u2019s actions. Additionally, as noted by the Delaware state\ncourts, Petitioner derived a significant benefit by pleading guilty. Petitioner would\nhave faced a minimum mandatory two-year sentence and a maximum twenty-five\nyear sentence if he had proceeded to trial on the third degree rape charge. By\npleading guilty to fourth degree rape, Petitioner eliminated the minimum\n\nmandatory two-year sentence and faced a lowered maximum sentence of fifteen\n18\nyears.\n\nThus, looking through the doubly deferential lens applicable to ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims on federal habeas review, the Court concludes that the\nDelaware state courts reasonably applied the Strickland/Hill standard in denying\nPetitioner's second ineffective assistance of counsel argument. Accordingly,\nthe Court will deny Claims Three and Four (b) for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nC. Claims Two and Five: Prosecutorial and Police Misconduct\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the State engaged in prosecutorial\nmisconduct by prosecuting him without forensic or physical evidence. In Claim\nFive, Petitioner contends that the police engaged in misconduct because the victim\nstated in her report to the Child Advocacy Center that she never had sex with\nPetitioner. After reviewing the instant arguments in conjunction with Petitioner\u2019s\nopening brief on post-conviction appeal (D.I. 11-9), the Court liberally construes\nClaims Two and Five as alleging that the State committed misconduct by\nwithholding favorable evidence and that there was insufficient evidence to indict\nor convict him. Petitioner presented these Claims to the Superior Court in his Rule\n61 motion. The Superior Court held that Claims Two and Five were procedurally\nbarred by Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(3) because Petitioner did\nnot present them during the plea colloquy, sentencing hearing, or direct appeal.\n\nSee Jobes, 2017 WL 5075380, at *2 . The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the\n19\nSuperior Court\u2019s decision, holding that \u201cthe Superior Court correctly recognized\nthat Rule 61(i)(3) barred [Petitioner\u2019s] claims that did not implicate the\neffectiveness of hi his counsel because he did not raise those claims during the\nguilty plea proceeding and did not demonstrate cause for the procedural default.\u201d\nJobes, 2019 WL 949374, at *2.\n\nBy applying the procedural bar of Rule 61(i)(3), the Delaware Supreme\nCourt articulated a \u201cplain statement\u201d under Harris v. Reed that its decision rested\non state law grounds. This Court has consistently held that Rule 61(i)(3) is an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rules effectuating a procedural default.\nSee Trice v. Pierce, 2016 WL 2771123, at *4 (D. Del. May 13, 2016). Therefore,\nthe Court cannot review the merits of Claims Two and Five absent a showing of\ncause for the default, and prejudice resulting therefrom, or upon a showing that a\nmiscarriage of justice will occur if the claim is not reviewed.\n\nPetitioner does not allege, and the Court does not discern, any cause for\nPetitioner\u2019s default of Claims Two and Five. The absence of cause eliminates the\nneed to address the issue of prejudice. Nevertheless, Petitioner cannot demonstrate\nthat he will be prejudiced by his default. The Court has already determined that\nthe Delaware state courts reasonably applied clearly established federal law in\nholding that Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. See\n\nsupra at Section III.B. A criminal defendant\u2019s valid guilty plea waives all non-\n20\njurisdictional issues\u2019 and claims \u201crelating to the deprivation of constitutional rights\nthat occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d Trice, 2016 WL 2771123, at *5.\nClaims Two and Five involve non-jurisdictional issues that occurred prior to the\nentry of Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea and do not challenge the voluntariness of that plea.\nSince Petitioner already waived his right to assert the arguments in Claims Two\nand Five by pleading guilty, he cannot demonstrate that he will be prejudiced by\nhis default of these Claims.\n\nAdditionally, Petitioner has not satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception\nto the procedural default doctrine because he has not provided new reliable\nevidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims Two\nand Five as procedurally barred from habeas review.\n\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also\ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2\n(2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when\n\na petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by\n\n7As noted by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the term non-jurisdictional\nis somewhat confusing and \u201c[t]he most accurate statement of the law would be...\n[that a] guilty plea waives all defenses except those that go to the court's subject-\nmatter jurisdiction and the narrow class of constitutional claims involving the right\nnot to be haled into court.\u201d United States v. DeVaughn, 694 F.3d 1141, 1193 (10th\nCir. 2012).\n\n21\ndemonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of\nthe constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief.\nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly,\nthe Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition must\n\nbe denied. An appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n22\n"}
