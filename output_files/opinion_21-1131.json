(Jointly Administered) \nNorth Carolina Capital, LLC, in its capacity \nas Trustee of and for the Aneth Trust and the : \nEPI Liquidating Trust, Adv. No. 21-50474 (LSS) \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBradley William Longo, et al., \nDefendants. Civ. No. 21-1131 (CFC) \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington this Twentieth day of September 2022: \nBefore the Court is the motion filed by two defendants, James Marshall \nPiccone and David Evans (\"Defendants\") to withdraw pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 157( d) \nthe reference of the above-captioned adversary proceeding (D.I. 1, 14) (\"Motion to \nWithdraw\"). Defendant Bradley William Lingo has joined the motion. (D.I. 3, 11). \nAlso before the Court is Defendants' unopposed motion to determine non-core \nproceedings (D .I. 8, 13) (\"Motion for Determination\"), which Lingo has also joined \n(D.1. 12). The Court has considered the responses (D.1. 9, 10) filed by North Carolina \nCapital, LLC (\"Plaintiff'), in its capacity as Trustee of and for the Aneth Trust and \nthe EPI Liquidating Trust ( each as defined below). For the reasons set forth below, \n1 Defendants' unopposed Motion for Determination is granted, and Defendants' \nMotion to Withdraw is denied. \n1. Background. On May 22, 2019 ( \"Petition Date\"), Debtors Elk \nPetroleum, Inc. (\"EPI\"), Elk Petroleum Aneth, LLC (\"EPA\") and Resolute Aneth, \nLLC filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy relief in the Bankruptcy Court. \n2. Pursuant to EPA's plan of reorganization (B.D.I. 594)1 (\"EPA Plan\") \nconfirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on October 8, 2019 (B.D.I. 619) (\"EPA \nConfirmation Order\"), the Aneth Trust Assets, which include the claims pursued in \nthis adversary proceeding, were transferred to the Aneth Trust. The Bankruptcy \nCourt retained jurisdiction over the claims pursued in the adversary proceeding. \n(EPA Confirmation Order\u00a7 12.l(b) (retaining jurisdiction \"to determine any motion, \nadversary proceeding, contested matter, and other litigated matter pending on or \ncommenced after the entry of the Confirmation Order, including any Cause of Action \nwhich may be asserted by the Aneth Trustee\"). The Bankruptcy Court further \nretained jurisdiction \"over all matters ... that relate to the matters set forth in the \nPlan\" (EPA Confirmation Order ,r 164 ), \"to determine whether or not any claim or \nright has been affected by the Plan or this Confirmation Order\" (id. ,r 165), and \"to \n1 The docket of the Chapter 11 cases, captioned In re Elk Petroleum, Inc., et al., No. \n19-11157 {LSS) (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"B.D.I. _.\" The docket of the \nadversary proceeding, captioned North Country Capital, LLC v. Bradley William \nLingo, et al., Adv. No. 21-50474 {LSS) (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Adv. D.I. \n\" \n2 take any action and issue such orders ... as may be necessary to construe, enforce, \nimplement, execute, and consummate this Plan, including any release, exculpation, or \ninjunction provisions set forth in this Plan\" (EPA Confirmation Order\u00a7 12.1(1)). \n3. Likewise, pursuant to EPI' s plan of reorganization (B .D .I. 926-1) (\"EPI \nPlan\") confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on July 24, 2020 (B.D.I. 928) (\"BPI \nConfirmation Order\"), the EPI Liquidating Trust Assets, which include the claims \npursued in the adversary proceeding, were transferred to the EPI Liquidating Trust. \n(EPI Plan\u00a7 6.4). The Bankruptcy Court similarly retained jurisdiction over the \nclaims pursued in the adversary proceeding, as well as \"to hear and determine \ndisputes arising in connection with the interpretation, implementation, or enforcement \nof this EPI Plan,\" \"to reconcile any inconsistency in any order of the Bankruptcy \nCourt, including, without limitation, the EPI Confirmation Order,\" and \"to hear and \ndetermine all disputes involving the existence, nature, or scope of the exculpation or \nreleases provided for in this BPI Plan.\" (EPI Plan \u00a7 11.1 (g), (k), ( o ); see also EPI \nConfirmation Order at ,r 67). \n4. On May 19, 2021, Plaintiff, as Trustee of and for the Aneth Trust and the \nEPI Liquidating Trust, filed a complaint (Adv. D.I. 1) (\"Complaint\") initiating the \nadversary proceeding against Defendants, who are former directors and officers of \nEPI and BP A, asserting claims for breaches of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting \nbreaches of fiduciary duties, and corporate waste, and asserting damages in excess of \n$30,000,000.00. \n3 5. Defendant Piccone has filed certain proofs of claim (\"POCs\") against the \nDebtors in the Chapter 11 cases. (See D.I. 9 at Ex. A-C). On August 10, 2021, \nPiccone filed his answer to the Complaint (Adv. D.I. 37). He did not demand in the \nanswer a jury trial. \n6. The docket of the adversary proceeding reflects that the discovery \nprocess is underway. (See Adv. D.I. 87-89, 93, 95-97). On July 18, 2022, the \nBankruptcy Court entered an Amended Scheduling Order (Adv. D.I. 118), which \nprovides that fact discovery will conclude by January 13, 2023; expert reports will be \ncompleted by April 24, 2023; expert depositions will conclude by May 12, 2023; \nbriefing on case dispositive motions will be completed by July 28, 2023; and no trial \ndate has been set. \n7. Motions to dismiss are pending. Defendant Evans filed a Motion to \nDismiss the Complaint, arguing that certain releases contained in the EPI Plan and \nEPI Confirmation Order released the claims asserted against him in the Complaint \n(Adv. D.I. 35) (\"Evans Motion to Dismiss\"). Defendant Lingo has also filed a \nmotion to dismiss (Adv. D.I. 50, 52). Oral argument has not yet been scheduled, and \nthe Bankruptcy Court has not ruled on either motion to dismiss. Additionally, the \nTrustee and Defendant Alexander Hunter have stipulated to extend the deadline for \nDefendant Hunter to file a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding (\"Hunter \nFiling Deadline\") through March 17, 2022, and that the parties were free to \"further \n4 extend the [Hunter] Filing Deadline without Court approval.\" (Adv. D.I. 103-1 at ,I \n7). \n8. Jurisdiction. District courts \"have original but not exclusive \njurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to \ncases under title 11.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b ). Pursuant to the authority granted by 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 157(a), this Court refers cases \"arising under title 11 or arising in or related \nto a case under title 11\" to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of \nDelaware. See Am. Standing Order of Reference, Feb. 29, 2012 (C.J. Sleet); In re \nVisteon Corp., 2011 WL 1791302, *3 (D. Del. May 9, 2011). \n9. Discussion. The reference to the Bankruptcy Court may be withdrawn \nby this Court in accordance with the mandatory and permissive withdrawal \nprovisions of28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d). Section 157(d) provides for situations when a \ndistrict court may withdraw the reference and when it must withdraw the reference: \nThe district court may withdraw, in whole or in part, any \ncase or proceeding referred under this section, on its own \nmotion or on timely motion of any party, for cause \nshown. The district court shall, on timely motion of a \nparty, so withdraw a proceeding if the court determines \nthat resolution of the proceeding requires consideration \nof both title 11 and other laws of the United States \nregulating organizations or activities affecting interstate \ncommerce. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d). For permissive withdrawal, \"[t]he 'cause shown' requirement in \nsection 157(d) creates a presumption that Congress intended to have bankruptcy \nproceedings adjudicated in bankruptcy court unless rebutted by a contravening \n5 policy.\" Hatzel & Buehler, Inc. v. Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp., 106 B.R. 367, \n371 (D. Del. 1989) (internal quotations omitted). To overcome that presumption, the \nmoving party has the burden to prove that cause exists to withdraw the reference. See \nNDEP Corp. v. Handl-It, Inc. (In re NDEP Corp.), 203 B.R. 905, 907 (D. Del. 1996). \n10. The well-recognized factors for this Court to consider in evaluating \nwhether cause for permissive withdrawal is established, as determined by the Third \nCircuit in In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d 1160, 1168 (3d Cir. 1990), are: (1) whether retention \nof the proceeding promotes the uniformity of bankruptcy administration; (2) whether \nretention of the proceeding reduces forum shopping and confusion; (3) whether \nretention of the proceeding fosters the economical use of debtor/creditor resources; \n( 4) whether retention of the proceeding would expedite the bankruptcy process; and, \n( 5) whether the request for withdrawal was timely. Id.; see also In re Visteon Corp., \n2011 WL 1791302, *3 (D. Del. May 9, 2011). Although a jury demand is not a \ndispositive factor, whether the claims will be tried to a jury is another factor that \nweighs in favor of withdrawing non-core proceedings. Visteon, 2011 WL 1791302, \n*3 ( citing NDEP and Hatzel & Buehler). \n11. A threshold determination is whether the matter to be withdrawn is a \ncore or non-core proceeding in bankruptcy court. Visteon, 2011 WL 1791302, at *3. \nDefendants' attempt to demonstrate cause to support permissive withdrawal rests \nalmost entirely on the non-core status of the claims pursued in the adversary \nproceeding, which has been conceded by Plaintiff. (See D.I. 9-1, 11, 14). But \"the \n6 mere fact the Complaint asserts non-core claims does not mandate withdrawal.\" In re \nAgFeed USA, LLC, 565 B.R. 556, 564 (D. Del. 2016). \"Proceedings should not be \nwithdrawn for the sole reason that they are non-core.\" Hatzel & Buehler, 106 B.R. at \n371. Indeed, \"[t]he 'cause shown' requirement in section 157(d) creates a \npresumption that Congress intended to have bankruptcy proceedings adjudicated in \nbankruptcy court unless rebutted by a contravening policy.\" AgFeed, 565 B.R. at 564 \n(citing Schubert v. Lucent Techs., Inc. (In re Winstar Commc 'ns, Inc.), 2004 WL \n2713101, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 16, 2004)). \n12. A defendant's right to a jury trial is also considered in conjunction with \nthe Pruitt factors, although it is not dispositive. NDEP, 203 B.R. at 908. Plaintiff \nargues that Defendant Piccone has waived his right to a jury trial by filing proofs of \nclaim against the estate. (D.I. 9 at 7-8). Defendant Piccone argues that he has not \nwaived his right to a jury trial because his proofs of claim do not implicate the claims \nallowance process. (D.I. 14 at 1-2). Indeed, a creditor's right to a jury trial depends \nupon whether that creditor filed a proof of claim and if the dispute in which it \nrequested a jury trial implicates the claims allowance process. Granfinanciera, S.A. \nv. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 58 (1989); In re WorldCom, Inc., 378 B.R. 745, 752 \n(Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2007) (recognizing line of United States Supreme Court cases that \nstand for the proposition that \"by filing a proof of claim a creditor forsakes its right to \nadjudicate before a jury any issue that bears directly on the allowance of that claim.\"). \n7 13. Defendant Piccone asserts that his POCs are not inextricably intertwined \nwith the causes of action in the Complaint, but his briefs provide no additional detail \nor substantive analysis. (See D.I. 1-2, 14). Lingo argues that \"Piccone's POC relates \nto his employment contracts and were filed as claims sounding in tort and equity \nagainst the Debtor for breach of those contracts.\" (D.I. 11 at 4-5). \"This is distinct \nfrom the Fiduciary Duty Claims,\" Lingo asserts, \"which concern Piccone's purported \nbreaches of fiduciary duties as a former director and/or officer of the Debtor. Even if \nthe Bankruptcy Court determines that Piccone has any amount due to him under the \nemployment contracts forming the basis of his assertions in the POC, the Bankruptcy \nCourt does not have to resolve the Fiduciary Duty Claims at that time in order to \nmake that determination.\" (Id.) Conversely, Plaintiff argues that the POCs filed by \nPiccone are inextricably tied to the adversary proceeding. Plaintiffs argument is \ncompelling. The POCs assert amounts due to Defendant Piccone pursuant to an \nemployment agreement with the Debtors and certain rights to indemnification from \nthe Debtors. Defendant Piccone alleges that he was \"compelled to resign\" his \nemployment with the Debtors, and indemnification rights were triggered, \"due to the \ngross failure of proper governance by the board and [Defendant Lingo].\" (See D.I. 9, \nEx. A-C). Thus, the gross failures of governance identified by Defendant Piccone \nalso give rise to the claims asserted by the Plaintiff in the adversary proceeding. \n14. Defendant Lingo asserts that, even if Piccone has waived his jury trial \nright, Lingo has not. See D.I. 11 at 3-4. In deciding whether to withdraw a case from \n8 the bankruptcy court based on a jury demand, courts consider ( 1) whether the case is \nlikely to reach trial; (2) whether protracted discovery with court oversight will be \nrequired; and (3) whether the bankruptcy court is familiar with the issues presented. \nIn re Enron Corp., 317 B.R. 232,235 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). Here, one can only speculate \nwhen the case will proceed to trial. The adversary proceeding remains in the early \nstages of discovery, and it is possible that the issues regarding release and other \nissues raised in the pending motions to dismiss may eliminate any need for trial. If \nnot, the claims involving breach of fiduciary duty may involve significant discovery \nrequiring court oversight. The Bankruptcy Court is familiar with the parties and the \ncircumstances that led to the bankruptcy filing, and it routinely adjudicates contested \nmatters involving corporate and contractual issues. \n15. As Plaintiff correctly points out, even if certain Defendants may \nultimately be entitled to a jury trial, the right to a jury trial does not justify withdrawal \nof the reference until the case is trial ready. See In re LTC Holdings, Inc., 2019 WL \n4643801, at *6 (D. Del. Sept. 24, 2019) (collecting cases); In re Big V Holding Corp., \n2002 WL 1482392, at *5 (D. Del. July 11, 2002) (\"Withdrawal of the reference based \non the ground that a party is entitled to a jury trial should be deferred until the case is \n'trial ready.'\"); Schneider v. Riddick (In re Formica Corp.), 305 B.R. 147, 150 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (\"While the plaintiff has a right to a jury trial, such a right does not \ncompel withdrawing the reference until the case is ready to proceed to trial.\"); In re \nEnron Corp., 318 B.R. 273, 275-76 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (finding that the bankruptcy \n9 court was in a \"superior position to manage\" the \"complex pretrial proceedings\" in \nthe case because it had familiarity with the contracts that were the subject of the \n\u00b7 dispute and the facts and circumstances which precipitated the debtors' bankruptcy \nfiling). \n16. In American Classic Voyages and Big V Holding Corp., this Court \ndenied withdrawal requests as premature because, among other things, the cases were \nnot trial ready and the proceedings could still have been resolved through dispositive \nmotions or settlement, eliminating the need for trial altogether. See Am. Classic \nVoyages Co., 337 B.R. 509,510 (D. Del. 2006); Big V, 2002 WL 1482392, at* 1. \nThat is precisely the situation here, where Defendant Piccone may have waived his \njury trial right and where the remaining Defendants have pending motions to dismiss \nthe adversary proceeding entirely. Based on these facts, I conclude that it would still \n\u00b7 be \"premature to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court based upon the \nunfixed proposition that a jury trial may occur in the future.\" Big V, 2002 WL \n1482392, at *5. \n1 7. Nor do the Pruitt factors establish cause for permissive withdrawal at \nthis time. Importantly, these factors are not weighed \"on a scale of equipoise\"\u00ad\nrather, the Defendants must \"overcome a scale already heavily weighted against \nwithdrawal.\" Feldman v. ABN AMERO Mortg. Grp., Inc., 2020 WL 618604, at *7 \n(E.D. Pa. Feb. 10, 2020). \n10 18. With respect to the first factor-forum shopping-Defendants assert that \nthere are no concerns regarding forum shopping or confusion, as Defendants do not \nseek transfer of the adversary proceeding from the District of Delaware and the \nresolution of the adversary proceeding turns on the application of Delaware state \n\u00b7 law.\" Plaintiff counters that, through the intense litigation that occurred in the early \nstages of the Chapter 11 cases, the Bankruptcy Court has been made aware of \n\"Defendants' misconduct\" and that Defendants are \"[ s ]eeking to \"secur[ e] a more \nfriendly forum,\" which \"is not a valid reason for a district court to withdraw [the] \nreference ... \" Doctors Assocs., Inc. v. Desai, 2010 WL 3326726, at *7 (D.N.J. Aug. \n23, 2010) (internal citation omitted). Plaintiff also points to the fact that that the \nUnited States Trustee moved to appoint an examiner to address allegations of \n\"mismanagement,\" arguing that \"an examiner would be able to provide \"[the \nBankruptcy] Court and parties in interest with an objective opinion and report of the \nDebtors' prepetition transactions.\" (B.D.I. 150). Defendants dispute any \ncharacterization of the litigation as intense, give that it \"was resolved after limited \ndiscovery and before the director defendants even filed a response to the complaint.\" \n(D.I. 11 at 6). Based on the limited record, this factor is neutral. \n19. With respect to the second factor-timeliness-Plaintiff concedes that \nthe request is not untimely, and this weighs in Defendants' favor. (D.I. 9 at 14). \n20. With respect to the third factor-uniformity-I do not agree that \nwithdrawal of the reference will promote uniformity of administration in the Debtors' \n11 bankruptcy cases. As noted already, the Bankruptcy Court is familiar with the \nparties, and the fact that Defendant Evans has raised the impact of releases provided \nin the BPI Plan and the BPI Confirmation Order demonstrates that the uniformity of \nbankruptcy administration is best served here by denying the Motion to Withdraw, as \nthe Bankruptcy Court expressly retained jurisdiction to hear and decide disputes \nrelating to its orders in the bankruptcy proceedings. \n21. With respect to the fourth factor-expediting the bankruptcy process\u00ad\nDefendants mainly argue that resolution of the adversary proceeding by the \nBankruptcy Court would require the Bankruptcy Court to expend resources on \nresolving issues that do not bear on the administration of the Debtors' estates. (D.I. \n1-2 at 4). Plaintiff disagrees, arguing (1) that the Bankruptcy Court already has \nfamiliarity with the claims at issue, and it would be a waste of estate resources to \nrestart that process with this Court; (2) Piccone has subjected himself to the \njurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, so even if this Court were to withdraw the \nreference now for pre-trial purposes, this Court would be required to remand the case \nagainst Piccone for trial; and (3) the Bankruptcy Court expressly retained jurisdiction \nto hear any disputes regarding the scope and interpretation of the releases provided in \nthe BPI Plan, which resolution of the adversary proceeding will require. I agree that \nthis factor weighs against withdrawal of the reference at this time. Adjudication of \nt~e adversary proceeding implicates the scope and interpretation of the BPI Plan \n12 release provisions. The process is streamlined by leaving the adversary proceeding in \nthe Bankruptcy Court unless and until a jury trial is required by any Defendants. \n22. With respect to the fifth factor-economical use of resources\u00ad\nDefendants argue that, because the adversary proceeding raises non-core claims and \nmay require a jury trial against some Defendants, judicial economy would be \npromoted if the Court withdraws the reference because the Court would be required \nto review the Bankruptcy Court's factual findings and legal conclusions de novo. \nThis review, however, does not support permissive withdrawal. As Plaintiff correctly \npoints out, this is precisely the shortcoming noted by the United States District Court \nfor the District of New Jersey in denying certain defendants' request to withdraw the \nreference: \nHere, the Court finds Defendants failed to satisfy their \nburden in demonstrating cause to withdraw the referral. . \n. . Defendants ... essentially rearticulate the same \nargument for each [Pruitt] factor-that granting their \nMotion to Withdraw Reference will promote judicial \neconomy because the Court is required to review the \nBankruptcy Court's factual findings and legal \nconclusions de novo. \nDefendants' argument is not persuasive. As other courts \nin this district have found, duplication of judicial effort is \ninsufficient to demonstrate cause because \"Congress \ncontemplated the district court will have the benefit of \nthe bankruptcy judge's findings of fact and conclusions \nof law with respect to matters over which the bankruptcy \ncourt could not enter final judgments.\" \n13 In re Princeton Alt. Income Fund, LP, 2018 WL 4854639, at *2 (D.N.J. Oct. 14, \n2018) (internal citations omitted). \n23. Conclusion. With respect to the Motion to Withdraw, Defendants have \nfailed to demonstrate a \"contravenin g policy\" which rebuts the presumption created \nby\u00a7 157(d) that the adversary proceeding should be adjudicated by the Bankruptcy \nCourt. With respect to the unopposed Motion for Determination, the claims asserted \nin Counts I-VIII of the Complaint arise from state law and are non-core proceedings. \nNOW, THEREFORE, it is HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Withdraw \n(D.I. 1) is DENIED, and the unopposed Motion for Determination (D.I. 8) is \nGRANTED. \nEntered this Twentieth day of September 2022. \nCL?4 \ufffd UNITED STATES DISTC T JUDGE \n14 "}
