Andrews", "date": "07-05-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRJCT OF DELAWARE \nWONDERLAND SWITZERLAND AG, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nEVENFLO COMPANY , INC., \nDefendant. C.A. No. 18-1990-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Plaintiffs post-trial motion for a permanent injunction. (D.I. 193). I have \nreviewed the parties' briefing. (D.I. 194-196). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs motion \nis DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Wonderland Switzerland AG filed suit against Defendant Evenflo Company, Inc. on \nDecember 14, 2018, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,862,117 (\"the '117 Patent\"), \n8,087,725 (\"the '725 Patent\"), and 8,123,294 (\"the '294 Patent\") (collectively, \"the Asserted \nPatents\"). (D.I. 1). Plaintiff argued that the LX, DLX, and Gold models of Defendant's \nEveryStage car seats (\"the Accused Products\" or \"the EveryStage Products\") infringe claims 1, 6, \n8, 10, 12, 13, and 15 of the '294 patent, claim 1 of the '725 patent, and claim 9 of the '117 patent \n(collectively, \"the Asserted Claims\"). (D.I. 176 at 1). \nThe '117 and '725 Patents share a common specification. (D .I. 1-1, Ex. A, B ). The Asserted \nClaims of these Patents are directed to \"transporting children in an automobile\" using a \n\"positionally adjustable head rest cooperable with a movable harness that relocates in response to \n1 the positional adjustment of the head rest.\" (Id., Ex. A, at 2:47-51). The Asserted Claims of the \n'294 Patent are directed to \"a harness storage system in a child's car seat to allow [a] five-point \nharness to be stowed out of the way without requiring the harness to be removed from the car seat \nshell.\" (Id., Ex. C. at 2:13-16). \nI held a remote bench trial from February 3 to 8, 2021. 1 (D.I. 168-171). I found that \nDefendant's Accused Products infringe claims 6 and 8 of the '294 Patent, claim 1 of the '725 \nPatent, and claim 9 of the '117 Patent (the \"Adjudged Claims\"). (D.I. 188 at 34). I also found \nthat claims 6 and 8 of the '294 Patent are not invalid, and that Plaintiff was entitled to $343,680 in \nreasonable royalty damages. (Id.). \nPlaintiff requests that this court permanently enjoin Defendant \"from infringing the Adjudged \nClaims, including by making, using, offering to sell, and selling the infringing EveryStage \nProducts in the United States, until the respective expiration of each Asserted Patent.\" (D.I. 193-\n1 at 2). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nCourts \"may grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the \nviolation of any right secured by patent, on such terms as the court deems reasonable .\" 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 283. \"According to well-established principles of equity, a plaintiff seeking a permanent \ninjunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such relief.\" eBay Inc. v. \nMercExchange , LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). \"A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has \nsuffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between \n1 I cite to the trial transcript as \"Tr.\" \n2 the plaintiff and defendant , a remedy in equity is warranted ; and ( 4) that the public interest would \nnot be disserved by a permanent injunction. \" Id. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nFor the following reasons, I find that Plaintiff has not satisfied the eBay factors in support of \nits proposed permanent injunction. (D.I. 193-1). \nA. Irreparable Injury \nTo prove irreparable injury, \"a patentee must establish both of the following requirements : 1) \nthat absent an injunction , it will suffer irreparable harm, and 2) that a sufficientl y strong causal \nnexus relates the alleged harm to the alleged infringement .\" Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., \n695 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\"Apple I\"). \nFirst, I previousl y held that \"the parties are direct competitors in the industry of the patented \ninvention. \" (D.I. 188 at 33; see also Tr. at 169:16-22, 267:7-20 ; 560:22-561:5 , 805:8-10). \nSpecifically , the parties do not dispute that Graco and Defendant directly compete in the car seat \nmarket. (See D.I. 195 at 2 (Defendant agreeing, \"There is no dispute that Evenflo directly \ncompetes with Graco, Wonderland 's customer in a large market for all-in-one car seats.\")). \nAdditionally , Plaintiff is the exclusive manufacturer of car seats sold by Graco in the United States. \n(See Tr. at 176: 13-23). Thus, if Graco loses a sale of a car seat, Plaintiff also loses a sale. (See \nid.). \nDefendant appears now to dispute whether the parties are direct competitors . (D.I. 195 at 8 \nn.l). But \"arguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not squarely argued, are \nconsidered waived.\" John Wyeth & Bro. v. CIGNA Int'! Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 (3d Cir. \n1997). While I recognize that the relationship between the parties is not the norm in patent \nlitigation, I find the competition between the parties-where lost sales for Graco are lost sales for \n3 Plaintiff-suggest s that Plaintiff could suffer irreparable harm. \"Where two companies are in \ncompetition against one another, the patentee suffers the harm-often irreparable-of being forced \nto compete against products that incorporate and infringe its own patented inventions.\" Douglas \nDynamics, LLC v. Buyers Prod. Co., 717 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \nPlaintiff argues that Defendant 's sales of the EveryStage Products also cause irreparable harm \nby reducing Plaintiffs market share. (See D.I. 194 at 5-6). For example, Renee Wang, \nManaging Director at Wonderland Switzerland , testified that Defendant's EveryStage car seat \nentered the U. S market \"in the middle of 2018 [,]\" and that \"the entry of the Every Stage car seat \ninto the U.S. market affected Wonderland 's sales of car seats[.]\" (Tr. at 271 :3-5, 272:8-10). \nSpecifically , Wang testified regarding Graco's market share for all-in-one car seats, \"I believe in \nthe beginning of '1 7, [ this market was] kind of like growing, but in '19 it's kind of like dropping. \nThat's what I remember. But if you want to ask me detailed number, I don't have.\" (Tr. at \n289:13-291:17, 290:12-15; see also Tr. at 272:8-273 :6, 285:12-286:11; JTX 25). Given the \nrelationship between Plaintiff and Graco, Plaintiffs market share would decrease accordingl y. \nDefendant disagrees , arguing that, while there \"is no dispute that Evenflo has a business goal to \ntake market share from its competitors ,\" \"they are not the only competitors in the all-in-one car \nseat market,\" and, \"Plaintiff adduced no evidence that Wonderland sells less product to Graco as \na result of Graco's competition[ .]\" (D.I. 195 at 2, 6-7; see Tr. at 623:22-624:8, 772:1-773 :19 \n(describing other competitors in the all-in-one car seat market)). \nI agree with Defendant and find that Plaintiff has not sufficiently shown a loss in market share, \nand also has not shown that Defendant 's infringement caused any loss in market share. For \nexample, while Wang testified that, following the release of the EveryStage products in 2018, \nGraco's share of the all-in-one car seat market was \"kind oflike dropping,\" I find this to provide \n4 only conclusory evidence that is insufficiently supported by actual data. Further, Plaintiff \nprovides insufficient evidence that the release of the EveryStage Products caused any of Graco' s \nloss in market share, particularly when considering that the market for all-in-one car seats includes \nmany additional companies that are not parties in this litigation. (See Tr. at 623:22-624:8, 772:1-\n773: 19). \"As plaintiffs and defendants are not the only competitors in this multi-supplier market, \ndefendants' infringement has not necessarily affected plaintiffs' market position.\" Belden Techs. \nInc. v. Superior Essex Commc 'ns LP, 802 F. Supp. 2d 555, 577 (D. Del. 2011); but cf Robert \nBosch LLC v. Pylon Mfg. Corp., 659 F.3d 1142, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (\"While the existence of a \ntwo-player market may well serve as a substantial ground for granting an injunction--e.g., because \nit creates an inference that an infringing sale amounts to a lost sale for the patentee-the converse \nis not automatically true.\") ( cleaned up). \nPlaintiff further argues that Defendant's sales of the EveryStage Products cause irreparable \nharm due to damage to its reputation as an innovative company and consumer tendencies to stick \nwith a single brand. (D.I. 194 at 6-8). Particularly , Wang testified that \"when consumer[s] ... \nstart to choose Evenflo car seats, they might also choose other products. . . . So if they also buy \nother EvenFlo products, ... we are not only losing the business of the car seat, we are also losing \nother product business like play yard[s] or stroller[s]. \" (Tr. at 272:16-273:6; see also 273:13-23 \n(describing damage to Plaintiff's reputation when other companies use Plaintiff's technology to \nmanufacture all-in-one car seats), 295:11-21 (describing Plaintiffs general policy not to license \nits patented technology to competitors)). In reviewing the record, however, I see no evidence that \nPlaintiff manufactures Graco's play yards or strollers and, thus, Plaintiff has not shown that it \nwould be harmed if Graco lost sales of these items. Moreover , I generally find Wang's testimony \nabout reputation loss, while sincere, to be unconvincing and conclusory . For these reasons, I do \n5 not find that Plaintiff has sufficiently shown irreparable harm resulting from reputation loss or the \npotential for lost sales in related markets . \nWhile the competition between the parties suggests that Plaintiff could suffer irreparable harm, \nweighing the evidence, I find that Plaintiff failed to establish that it will suffer irreparable harm \nabsent a permanent injunction. \nSecond, because I find that Plaintiff failed to establish that it will suffer irreparable harm, I \nneed not consider whether Plaintiff has shown that there is a sufficiently strong causal nexus that \nrelates the alleged harm to the proven infringement. \nFor these reasons, I find that Plaintiff has not suffered an irreparable injury. \nB. Remedies Available at Law \nPlaintiff must show that damages are inadequate to compensate for Defendant 's infringement. \nSee eBay, 547 U.S. at 391. \nPlaintiff argues that damages are inadequate to compensate for Defendant 's infringement \nbecause Plaintiff has lost market share due to Defendant 's sales of the EveryStage Products, where \nthe effects of these lost sales are compounded due to consumer tendencies to buy other children's \nproducts from the same brand. (D.I. 194 at 8-9 (citing Tr. at 272:16-273:23); see also D.I. 194 at \n9 (Plaintiff noting that its policy not to license its patents to others is consistent with a finding that \nmonetary damages would be inadequate to remedy Defendant's infringement)). Defendant \ndisagrees and argues that there is no evidence of lost market share. (D.I. 195 at 9-10). \nFor the reasons addressed in Section III.A, I find that Plaintiff has not shown that it would lose \nmarket share due to Defendant 's infringement , that it would lose sales of other children's products, \nor that it has suffered reputation loss. Thus, considering the evidence , I find that Plaintiff has not \nshown that damages are inadequate to compensate for Defendant's infringement. \n6 C. Balance of Hardships and Public Interest \nIn view of my conclusions on irreparable harm and the remedies available at law, I need not \nmake any findings concerning the additional factors Plaintiff must establish when moving for a \npermanent injunction \nIV. CONCLUSION \nPlaintiff's post-trial motion for a permanent injunction (D.I. 193) is DENIED . \n.-n,.. \nIT IS SO ORDERED thisj day of July 2022. \n7 "}
