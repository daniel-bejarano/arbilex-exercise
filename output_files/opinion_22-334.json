(D.I.  29)  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, the Court recommends that the motion to dismiss be GRANTED- IN-PART and \nDENIED -IN-PART . \nI. BACKGROUND \n \nA. Factual Background \nPlaintiff Illumina is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San \nDiego, California.  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 4)  The company was founded in 1998 by scientists studying the \n \n1  Eltoukhy and Talasaz will at times be referred to herein as the \u201cIndividual \nDefendants.\u201d  \n 2 \n mapping of the human genome, and it develops and manufactures tools and integrated systems \nfor genetic analysis.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 5 -6)   \nDefendant Guardant is a Delaware corporation with its principal p lace of business in \nRedwood City, California.  ( Id. at \u00b6 10)  Guardant develops and markets blood- based cancer \ndetection tests.  ( Id.; see also D.I. 30 at 1, 4)   \nGuardant was founded by Defend ants Eltoukhy and Talasaz, two former Illumina \nemployees  who are both resi dents of California .  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 \u00b6 3, 11 -13)  On December 9, 2011, \nwhile still employed by Illumina, Eltoukhy and Talasaz anonymously incorporated Guardant in Delaware.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 26)  Talasaz worked at Illumina from 2009 until June 2012 and \nEltoukhy worked there from 2008 until January 2013.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 28, 31)  Upon leaving their \nemployment at Illumina, both men immediately be came employed by Guardant \u2014Talasaz in June \n2012 and Eltoukhy in January 2013.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 28 -30, 63- 64)  Howe ver, while Eltoukhy was still \nemployed at  Illumina, he worked with Talasaz on Guardant projects and technologies, and acted \nas a corporate agent and fiduciary of Guardant.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 32- 38)  Eltoukhy is now the Chief \nExecutive Officer of Guardant, and Tal asaz is the Chief Operating Officer of Guardant.  ( Id. at \n\u00b6\u00b6 12 -13)   \nWhile at Illumina, Eltoukhy and Talasaz agreed to and were bound by employment \nagreements and company policies , which requir ed them to: \ndevote their efforts to Illumina\u2019s business, to not compete with \nIllumina, to avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise their loyalty to Illumina, to assign to Illumina their inventions made while employed by Illumina that are related to Illumina\u2019s business, to protect Illumina\u2019s confidential and proprietary information, to not take or use Illumina\u2019s resources and property for their personal benefit, and to return Illumina materials to the company upon termination of their employment.  \n 3 \n (Id. at \u00b6 19)  These employment agreements and company policies included:  (1) a Proprietary \nInformation and Invention Agreement (\u201cPIIA\u201d); (2) Confidentiality\u2014Disclosure on Need -To-\nKnow Basis Only Acknowledgement (\u201cConfidentiality Acknowledgment \u201d); (3) Code of Ethi cs; \nand (4) a Termination Certificate at the end of their employment.  ( Id. at \u00b6 18) \n The Complaint alleges that while still employed at Illumina, Eltoukhy and Talasaz \naccessed Illumina\u2019s confidential information and resources relating to \u201cIllumina\u2019s propr ietary \nerror correction methods, cell -free DNA, copy number variations, next-generation sequencing, \nand communication theory.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 22; see also id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 24-25)  For example, it is alleged \nthat d uring the second half of 2012, Eltoukhy, while still employed at  Illumina, forwarded \nIllumina\u2019s confidential information to his personal e- mail account and to Talasaz; Eltoukhy and \nTalasaz then allegedly used this confidential information to develop Guardant\u2019s patent portfolio, \nincluding 35 patents that are assigned to Guardant.2  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40-50, 53)  The confidential \n \n2  The 35 patents at issue consist of three patent families.  ( See D.I. 30 at 8 n.2; Tr. \nat 178)  The first patent family (the \u201c'127 patent family\u201d) includes 19 of the 35 patents:  U.S. \nPatent Nos. 10,041,127 (\u201cthe '127 patent\u201d); 9,598,731 (\u201cthe '731 patent\u201d); 9,834,822 (\u201cthe '822 \npatent\u201d); 9,840,743 (\u201cthe '743 patent\u201d); 10,837,063 (\u201cthe '7063 patent\u201d); 10,457,995 (\u201cthe '995 \npatent\u201d); 10,494,678 (\u201cthe '678 patent\u201d); 10,501,808 (\u201cthe '808 patent\u201d); 10,501,810 (\u201cthe '810 patent\u201d);  10,683,556 (\u201cthe '556 patent\u201d); 10,738,364 (\u201cthe '364 patent\u201d); 10,793,916 (\u201cthe '916 \npatent\u201d);  10,822,663 (\u201cthe '663 patent\u201d); 10,961,592 (\u201cthe '592 patent\u201d); 10,876,171 (\u201cthe '171 \npatent\u201d); 1 0,876,172 (\u201cthe '172 patent\u201d); 10,947,600 (\u201cthe '600 patent\u201d); 10,995,376 (\u201cthe '376 \npatent\u201d)  and 11,001,899 (\u201cthe '899 patent\u201d).   \nThe second patent family (the \u201c'992 patent family\u201d) includes nine of the 35 patents:  U.S. \nPatent Nos. 9,902,992 (\u201cthe '992 patent\u201d); 10,894,974 (\u201cthe '974 patent\u201d); 10,876,152 (\u201cthe '152 patent\u201d); 10,704,086 (\u201cthe '086 patent\u201d); 10,704,085 (\u201cthe '085 patent\u201d); 11,091,797 (\u201cthe '797 patent\u201d); 10,870,880 (\u201cthe '880 patent\u201d); 10,982,265 (\u201cthe '265 patent\u201d) and 11,091,796 (\u201ct he \n'796 patent\u201d).   \nThe third patent family (the \u201c'366 patent family\u201d) includes seven of the 35 patents:  U.S. \nPatent Nos. 9,920,366 (\u201cthe '366 patent\u201d); 10,883,139 (\u201cthe '139 patent\u201d); 10,801,063 (\u201cthe '1063 patent\u201d); 10,889,858 (\u201cthe '858 patent\u201d); 11,118,221 (\u201cthe '221 patent\u201d); 11,149,306 (\u201cthe '306 patent\u201d) and 11,149,307 (\u201cthe '307 patent\u201d).  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 50; D.I. 30 at 8 n.2) 4 \n Illumina information included a slide  presentation relating to \u201c error rate improvements and \ncommunication theory ideas\u201d on how to decode barcodes more effectively (the \u201ccommunication \ntheory slides\u201d) ; Eltoukhy requested and obtained these slides on June 27, 2012 from another \nIllumina employee, Frank Steemers, who at the  time was a senior director and researcher \nworking on sequencing technology for Illumina.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40 -48)   \nThe Complaint also alleges that while still employed by Illumina, Eltoukhy drafted and \nrevised patent claims for Guardant using Illumina\u2019s comput ers.  ( Id. at \u00b6 54)  On December 15, \n2012, Eltoukhy e -mailed draft patent claims dated August 10, 2012 to his personal Gmail \naccount from his Illumina work e -mail account.  ( Id. at \u00b6 55)   \nAnd the Complaint asserts that w hen Eltoukhy left his employment at  Illumina, he took \nvarious Illumina documents with him.  More specifically, it states that Eltoukhy appropriated \nmore than 51,000 emails from Illumina, including more than 1,400 documents that were labeled \u201c\u2018COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL \u2014INTERNAL USE ONLY. \u2019\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 65- 66) \nEltoukhy is  alleged to have taken various steps to conceal the fact that he was transferring \nIllumina\u2019s confidential information outside of the company.  One such example referenced in the Complaint is Eltoukhy\u2019s use (referenced above) of his personal, non- Illumina e -mail address to \ntransfer Illumina confidential information to Guardant.  ( Id. at \u00b6 69)  Another relates to the \napplication that later issued as the '743 patent; th at application, filed on March 23, 2017, listed \nboth Eltoukhy and Talasaz as inventors.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  72-73)  However, Eltoukhy\u2019s name as an \ninventor was removed from the application on October 27, 2017.  ( Id. at \u00b6 74)   \n Illumina  alleges that it did not lear n of any of  Defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct until at least \nin or a round June 2019.  In  that month, Illumina became aware of some of the above -referenced \nmisconduct  in the course of responding to third- party discovery requests that were served on it in 5 \n a patent l itigation that Guardant had filed in this District against Foundation Medicine, Inc. \n(Guardant Health, Inc. v. Foundation Medicine, Inc., C ivil Action  No. 17- 1616- LPS-CJB (D. \nDel.)) and Personal Genome Diagnostics  (Guardant Health, Inc. v. Personal Genome \nDiagnostics, Inc., C ivil Action No. 17- 1623- LPS-CJB (D. Del.)) (collectively, the \u201cFMI \nlitigation\u201d).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 75-78)   \nThereafter, b etween August and November 2019, Eltoukhy\u2019s name as an inventor was \nremoved from more Guardant patent applications on which he was originally named as an \ninventor  (these ap plications issued as the '995 patent, the '808 patent, the '152 patent and the \n'7063 patent).  ( Id. at \u00b6 79)  And after being deposed in the FMI litigation on April 8, 2019, \nEltoukhy is alleged to have deleted or attempted to delete confidential Illumina d ocuments from \nhis personal files.  ( Id. at \u00b6 80) \nAdditional relevant factual allegations will be discussed below in the appropriate portions \nof Section II.  \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn March 17, 2022, Illumina filed its C omplaint in this case.  (D.I. 1)  The Complaint \ncontains  four Counts:   \n\u2022 Count I:  Declaratory Judgment to Correct Inventorship and \nOwnership under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 84- 102)   \n \u2022 Count II:  Misappropriation of Illumina Trade Secrets Under California\u2019s Uniform Trade Secrets Act  [\u201cCUTSA\u201d] , \nCal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3426 et seq . against all Defendants.  ( Id. \nat \u00b6\u00b6 103- 20);  \n \n\u2022 Count III:  Breach of Contract against Eltoukhy.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n121-31); and  \n \n\u2022 Count IV:  Breach of Contract against Talasaz.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n 132-42) \n 6 \n On May 25, 2022, Defendants  filed the Motion.  ( D.I. 29)   Briefing on the Motion was \ncompleted on July 20, 2022.  (D.I.  45)  On September 12, 2022, United States District Judge \nGregory B. Williams referred th is case to the Co urt to hear and resolve all pre -trial matters up to \nand including expert discovery matters (but not including summary judgment motions, Daubert  \nmotions, pre -trial motions in limine or the pre -trial conference).  (D.I. 62)  The Court heard oral \nargument on the Motion on December 9, 2022.  (D.I. 83 (hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d))  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nIn the portions of its M otion filed pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6), Defendants argue, for \nvarious reasons, that each of Counts I -IV should be dismissed.  The Court will addre ss those \nRule 12(b)(6) arguments first.  The reafter , the Court will take up the portion of Defendants\u2019 \nMotion in which they  argue, pursuant to Rule  12(b)(2), that Counts II, III and IV should be \ndismissed against the Individual Defendants for lack of perso nal jurisdiction.   \nA.   Defendants\u2019  Arguments for Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)  \n1. Legal Standard  \n \nThe sufficiency of pleadings for non- fraud claims is governed by Rule 8, which requires  \n\u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 8(a)(2).  If a Rule 12(b)(6) movant asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to plead \nsufficient facts necessary to set out a plausible claim, then the reviewing court conducts a  two-\npart analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  First, the court \nseparates the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well -\npleaded facts as true, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d   Id. at 210- 11.  Second, the court \ndetermines \u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has 7 \n a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).3   \nIn assessing th e plausibility of a claim, the court must \u201cconstrue the complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, \nthe plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d  Id.  at 210 (quoting Phillips v.  Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 \nF.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)). \n2. Discussion  \n \nHaving set out the relevant legal standard, the Court will now address Defendants\u2019 Rule \n12(b)(6) arguments as to Illumina\u2019s inventorship, trade secret misappropriation and breach of contra ct claims in turn. \na. Has Illumina Sufficiently Pleaded its Inventorship C laim \nUnder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256? \n \nIn Count I of the Complaint, Illumina alleges that the inventorship of the 35 patents \nshould be corrected under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256 (\u201cSection 256\u201d), such that Eltoukhy and/or Steemers \nshould be added as co-inventors on the 35 patents,\n4 and that Illumina should be recognized as at \nleast a co -owner of those patents (in light of the fact that Eltoukhy and Steemers would have then \n \n3  In resolving a motion to dismiss, a court typically only considers the allegations in \nthe complaint, the exhibits attached thereto, documents or facts that are incorporated by \nreference into the complaint or that are otherwise integral to the complaint\u2019s allegations, matters of public record and items for which the court can take judicial notice.  See Siwulec v. J.M. Adjustment Servs., LLC , 465 F. App\u2019x 200, 202 (3d Cir. 2012); ING Bank, fsb v. PNC Fin. Servs. \nGrp., Inc ., 629 F. Supp. 2d 351, 354 (D. Del. 2009).   \n \n4  More specifically, Illumina alleges that:  (1) Eltoukhy should be named as a joint \ninventor of all patents in the '127 patent family; of eight of the nine patents in the '992 patent \nfamily (all but the '992 patent); and of one patent from the '366 patent family (the '858 patent); \nand (2) Steemers should be named as a joint inventor of the patents making up all thre e patent \nfamilies.  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 143(A)- (C))   \n 8 \n been obligated to assign their patent rights to Illumina ) (the \u201cinventorship claim\u201d) .5  (D.I. 1  at \u00b6\u00b6 \n98-102)  Defendants argue that Illumina\u2019s inventorship claim fails because:  (1) Illumina\u2019s \nallegations relating to Eltoukhy and Steemers\u2019 contributions to the 35 patents are too vague and \nconclusory to plausibly plead an inventorship claim; and (2) Illumina has failed to sufficiently \nplead that it has an ownership interest in the patents, and thus it lacks Article III standing to \nchallenge inventorship of the 35 patents.6  (D.I. 30 at 8-16; D.I. 45 at 1-5)  \n \n5  Illumina\u2019s Complaint also seeks an order requesting the correction of inventorship \nwith respect to nine patent applications \u201cif issued as patents[.] \u201d  (Id.)  Defendants argue that any \npart of Count I that relates to a request to correct inventorship on these patent applications should \nbe dismissed , because a claim for correction of inventorship pursuant to Section 256 does not \naccrue until the patent issues  (and thus any claims pertaining to patent applications are not yet \nripe).  (D.I. 30 at 16-17; Tr. at 202); see also Hor v. Chu, 699 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cA [Section] 256 claim for correction of inventorship does not accrue until the patent issues.\u201d); Display R sch. Labs. , Inc. v. Telegen Corp., 133 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1173 (N.D. Cal. 2001) \n(explaining that Section 256 is inapplicable to patent applications and that \u201cany claims made thereunder based on patents that may issue are speculative and not ripe for review\u201d).  Illumina retorts that it does not intend to currently press a claim in Count I relating to these patent applications, and that it referenced the applications  in the Complaint only to note that it would \nseek relief on th em if t hey later issue as patents.  (D.I.  41 at 21; Tr. at 196-97)  The Court agrees \nwith Defendants that it is not appropriate to keep any such claims pending \u201csuch that they would \nspring to life if and when Guardant\u2019s patents are issued[.]\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 2 n.2)  The Court therefore recommends th at the portions of paragraph 143(A)- (C) of the Complaint referring to \nthe patent applications be STRICKEN .  See, e.g., Kirchner v. Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Inc., \n580 F. Supp. 3d 57, 65-66 (D. Del. 2022) (striking portion of an improper allegation in resolving a motion to dismiss).    \n \n6  Defendants\u2019 standing argument implicates Rule 12(b)(1), which authorizes \ndismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or if the plaintiff \nlacks  standing to bring its claim.  Motions brought under Rule 12(b)(1 ) may present either a \nfacial or factual challenge to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.  See Lincoln Ben efit Life  Co. \nv. AEI Life,  LLC , 800 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015) ( citing Common  Cause of Pa.  v. Pennsylvania, \n558 F.3d 249, 257 (3d Cir. 2009)).  In reviewing a facial challenge under Rule 12(b)(1),  which is \nat issue here,  the same standards relevant to Rule 12(b)(6) apply.  In this regard, the court must \naccept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and the court may only consider the \ncomplaint and documents referenced in or attached thereto .  Id.; see also  Church of Univ . \nBrotherhood. v.  Farmington Twp. Supervisors , 296 F. App\u2019x 285, 288 (3d Cir. 2008).  9 \n  Section 256 \u201cprovides a cause of action to interested parties to have the inventorship of a \npatent changed to reflect the true inventors of the subject matter claimed in the patent.\u201d  Fina Oil  \n& Chem.  Co. v.  Ewen , 123 F.3d 1466, 1471 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  A complaint alleging  a Section \n256 correction of inventorship claim under a joint inventorship theory must allege that each \n\u201cjoint inventor . . . contribute [d] to the invention\u2019 s conception.\u201d  CODA  Dev. S.R.O. v.  Goodyear \nTire & Rubber Co., 916 F.3d 1350, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2019); Fina  Oil, 123 F.3d at 1473 (\u201c[T]o be \na joint inventor, an individual must make a contribution to the conception of the claimed \ninvention that is not insignificant in quality, when that contribution is measured against the \ndimension of the full invention.\u201d).  However, a  joint inventor need not \u201cmake the same type or \namount of contribution\u201d to the invention nor contribute to every claim; a contribution to one claim is enough.  CODA , 916 F.3d at 1358 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see \nalso Vanderbilt Univ.  v. ICOS  Corp., 601 F.3d 1297, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (\u201c[E]ach contributor \nneed not have their own contemporaneous picture of the final claimed invention in order to \nqualify as joint inventors .\u201d).  There is no \u201cexplicit lower limit on the quantum or quality of \ninventive contribution required for a person to qualify as a joint inventor.\u201d  Fina  Oil, 123 F.3d at \n1473.  Rather, a joint invention is the product \u201cof a collaboration between two or more persons working together to solve the problem addressed.\u201d  Id. ; see also Eli  Lilly  & Co. v.  Aradigm \nCorp., 376 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (\u201cJoint inventorship . . . can only arise when collaboration or concerted effort occurs\u2014that is, when the inventors have some open line of communication during or in temporal proximity to their inventive efforts[.]\u201d).  A joint inventor must \u201cdo more than merely explain to the real inventors well-known concepts and/or the current state of the art.\u201d  In re VerHoef , 888 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citation omitted) .    10 \n Inventorship of a patent is a distinct concept from ownership of a patent.  Beech  Aircraft  \nCorp. v.  EDO Corp., 990 F.2d 1237, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  While inventorship concerns who \nactually invented the subject matter claimed in a patent , ownership is a \u201cquestion of who owns \nlegal title to the subject matter claimed in a patent, patents having the attributes of personal \nproperty.\u201d  Id.   Even so, \u201c[a]t the heart of any ownership analysis lies the question of who first \ninvented the subject matter at issue, because the patent right initially vests in the inventor who \nmay then, barring any restrictions to the contrary, transfer that right to another[.]\u201d  Id.   To \nsufficiently plead a cognizable injury for an inventorship claim pursuant to Section 256, a \nplaintiff must allege facts establishing that it has expected ownership rights or a \u201cconcrete \nfinancial interest\u201d in the patent at issue.   Larson v.  Corr ect Craft,  Inc., 569 F.3d 1319, 1326 (Fed. \nCir. 2009); Chou v.  Univ.  of Chi., 254 F.3d 1347, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir. 2001).   \nThe Court will first assess Illumina\u2019s inventorship claim with respect to Steemers, and \nwill then turn to the claim as it relates to Eltoukhy.    \ni. Illumina\u2019s inventorship claim with respect to Steemers  \n The Court agrees with Defendants that Illumina\u2019s assertion  that Steemers should be \nadded to the 35 patents as a joint inventor is insufficiently pleaded.  (D.I. 30 at 12; D.I. 45 at 3)  \nThe Complaint broadly alleges that Steemers contributed \u201cnovel concepts and work\u201d to the \ninventions of all 35 patents that \u201c include, for example, applications of error correction methods \nand communication theory ideas, including in grouping sequence reads into families and then \ncollapsing those reads into a single consensus sequence from the sequence reads in the families.\u201d  \n(D.I. 1 at \u00b6 90)  T he Complaint\u2019s only factual support for this allegation is that in response to a \nrequest from Eltoukhy for a \u201cspecific presentation . . .  concerning random coding improvement \nin error rate for use in genetic sequencing to obtain better accuracy from fewer sequence 11 \n reads[,]\u201d  Steemers provided Eltoukhy with the communication theory slides\u2014slides that are not \nattached to the Complaint\u2014\u201crelating to [] error rate improvements and communication theory \nideas.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 41, 46)7  But importantly, it is not at all clear from the Complaint that Steemers \nhimself generated whatever ideas may be reflected in the slides .  (Tr. at 144)  Instead, the \nComplaint vaguely alleges that the slides reflected \u201cyears of novel work by Illumina personnel , \nincluding valuable methods and data that Illumina personnel  had created [.]\u201d  (D.I. 1  at \u00b6 48  \n(emphasis added) )  These slides were generated at Illumina; presumably Illumina knows whether \nit was Steemers ( or instead some other Illumina employee (s)) who contributed to the concepts \ndiscussed in the slides.  (Tr. at 190-91)8  But the Complaint does not clearly assert t hat it was \n \n7  Because the communication theory slides were not attached to the Complaint and \nare not described in great detail in the Complaint, it is difficult for the Court to assess (based on \nthe information of record that it can rely on here) what content is  actually found in these slides .  \nHowever, later in paragraph 57, the Complaint alleges that Eltoukhy obtained confidential material from Illumina employees such as \u201c Illumina\u2019s confidential and proprietary error \ncorrection methods and communication theory ideas, including methods for grouping sequence reads into families and then collapsing those reads into a single consensus from the sequence reads in the families.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 57)  This allegation (about \u201cconfidential material\u201d that \nEltoukhy \u201cobtained\u201d from Illumina employees) must in part be a reference to Eltoukhy\u2019s efforts \nto obtain the communication theory slides from Steemers .  With that in mind, and considering \nthe allegations regarding the types of contributions that Steemers allegedly made to the patents , \nthe Court can conclude that the information described in paragraph 57 is meant to reference, at minimum, at least some of the content of the communication theory slides.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 41, 90; see \nalso id. at \u00b6\u00b6 58 -59, 61; D.I. 30 at 19 n.9; Tr. at 198)  Put differently, in light of the above, the \nComplaint plausibly alleges that the communication theory slides include at least some content regarding \u201cmethods for grouping sequence reads into families and then collapsing those reads into a single consensus sequence from the sequence reads in the families. \u201d   \n \n8  During oral argument, Illumina\u2019s counsel came close to suggesting that it may not  \nhave been Steemers who created/contribut ed to these slides \u2014or at least that Illumina may  not be \nsure whether it was Steemers or some other Illumina employee(s) who did so.  (Tr. at 189-90 \n(Illumina\u2019s counsel stating \u201cYour Honor, our point was that an Illumina employee created those slides. . . . or contributed to them.  That Illumina employee would be the contributor to the claimed invention through the process that we\u2019ve talked about.  We believe and we think the reasonable inference is Steemers made contributions to [the slides,] and on that ground is a joint inventor.  But the reason for that language in the briefing was [that] if it turned out to be the case that it was someone else who[ is] an Illumina employee, the analysis would be no different.\u201d))  12 \n Steemers  that did so.  The Complaint therefore f ails to state a claim that Steemers  contributed to \nthe conception and reduction to practice of the 35 patents and that he should in turn be named as \na joint inventor on those patents.  Cf. Intel Corp. v. Tela Innovations, Inc., Case No. 3:18- cv-\n02848- WHO, 2019 WL 2476620, at *6 (N.D. Cal. June 13, 2019) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s \nargument that the plaintiff\u2019s joint inventorship claim should fail because, inter alia , the \ncomplaint \u201cdoes not clarify that the technology shared at the meeting was Pileggi\u2019s invention \nrather than another Fabbrix employee\u2019s [,]\u201d because an allegation in the complaint \u201cspecifically \ncalls it \u2018Professor Pileggi\u2019s technology\u2019\u201d).9 \nThe Court further concludes that the inventorship claim with respect to Steemers fails for \nan additional reason:  the Complaint does not plausibly allege facts relating to Steemers that \nindicate s how Illumina owns or co -owns the patents -at-issue.  Thus, Illumina has not plausibly \narticulated how it has Article III standing to ch alleng e the inventorship of the 35 patents in light \nof Steemers \u2019 alleged contributions thereto.  (D.I. 30 at 13-16; D.I. 45 at 5; Tr. at 171-72)   \nIn this regard, t he Complaint a sserts in only conclusory fashion that Illumina should be \ndeclared co -owner of the 35 patents based on \u201cSteemers\u2019 assignments to Illumina[.]\u201d   (D.I. 1 at \n\u00b6\u00b6 100, 102)  Yet while the pleading otherwise clearly states  that Eltoukhy and Talasaz  entered \ninto certain employment contracts  that, inter alia , required that they assign to Illumina certain \n \nBut if some other Illumina employee were responsible for conceiving of the content of these \nslides, then it would be that unidentified Illumina employee who should be named as a co-\ninventor of the patents, not Steemers (as the Complaint alleges).   \n \n9  In its briefing, Defendants  also argue that i t is not clear from the Complaint how  \nSteemers can be said to have collaborated with either Eltoukhy (assuming that Eltoukhy was in fact a co -inventor) or Talasaz to come up with any contributions to the 35 patents at issue.  (D.I. \n30 at 12; D.I. 45 at 3; Tr. at 144-45)  But with the Complaint failing to plausibly allege Steemers \u2019 \nco-inventorship on other grounds, the Court need not resolve this issue.  \n 13 \n inventions they created while employed by Illumina, there are no clear factual allegations that \nSteemers  executed any such assignment agreements.  ( Id. at \u00b6 19; see also Tr. at 172, 197-98)10  \nThus, Illumina has not sufficiently alleged that it has an ownership interest in the 35 patents via \nany act  of or any connection wit h Steemers .  Consequently, Illumina  has not demonstrat ed \nstanding to assert ownership over any  patents that may include contributions made by Steemers.  \nSee Blackhawk Network  Inc. v. SL Card Co. Inc. , 589 F. Supp. 3d 1115, 1128 (D. Ariz. 2022) \n(\u201c[T]he Complaint contains no allegation that the employees assigned their putative rights in \nDefendants\u2019 patents to Blackhawk.

Illumina\u2019s inventorship claim with respect to Eltoukhy  \nNext, the Court assesses Illumina\u2019s inventorship claim as it r elates to Eltoukhy.  \nDefendants\u2019 first argument here is that the Complaint (1) \u201cmakes only conclusory assertions \ndescribing Dr. Eltoukhy\u2019s contributions, and even then, only in reference to seven claims of the \n178 claims in seven of the patents in the '127 and ' 992 Patent Families\u201d; but (2) says \u201cnothing at \nall (conclusory or otherwise) about Dr. Eltoukhy\u2019s contributions as to the other patents in those \nfamilies.\u201d  (D.I. 30 at 10; see also D.I. 45 at 2 (Defendants arguing that the 28 patents that \n\u201cIllumina fails to address at all should be dismissed\u201d and that, for the seven patents i t does \naddress, \u201cIllumina fails to identify any non-conclusory allegations showing inventive \ncontributions by [] Eltoukhy\u201d) (emphasis in original))  This raises the question of what must a \n \n10  Again, these are Illumina\u2019s employment agreements.  S o presumably Illumina \nwould be in a position to know which of their employees signs what type of agreement, and \nwhether and why it is plausible that any particular employee ( here, Steemers) did so in the past.   14 \n plaintiff plead in a complaint to plausibly establish that a joint inventor contributed to an \ninvention\u2019s conception?   \nAs a threshold matter, Defendants\u2019 argument was that  in a complaint,  a plaintiff must s et \nout the joint inventor\u2019s contributions on a \u201c\u2018claim -by-claim basis. \u2019\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 2 (citation \nomitted); see also  D.I. 30 at 10; Tr. at 157, 159-60)  One could read this as an assertion that , in \norder to plead a claim for  joint inventorship under Section 256, the plaintiff has to list out every \nclaim found in every patent- at-issue and inform the reader, on a \u201c claim -by-claim basis, \u201d whether \nthe purported co-inventor contributed something significant to each one of those claims (and if \nso, how ).  If that is what Defendants mean by \u201cclaim -by-claim basis, \u201d then the Court disagrees \nthat this level of specificity is required.11    \nOn the other hand, the Court does agree with Defendants that in order to sufficiently \nplead a Section 256 joint inventorship claim, with respect to the nature of the joint inventor\u2019s \ncontribution, a plaintiff must:  (1) identify a t least one  concept that is included in at least one \nidentified claim  of a patent- at-issue and then (2) allege some facts rendering it plausible that the \npurported co -inventor actually contributed (in a non-insignificant way) to at least that portion of \nthe claimed invention .  (Tr. at 148-50, 185)  After all, in order to be a co -inventor, one has to \ncontribute to the \u201c claimed  invention[.]\u201d  Fina  Oil, 123 F.3d at 1473 (emphasis added); see also  \n \n11  It is worth noting that Defendants lift this \u201cclaim-by- claim basis \u201d phraseology \nfrom the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in  Trovan, Ltd. v. \nSokymat SA, Irori , 299 F.3d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  (D.I. 45 at 2)  It is true that, in Trovan, the \nFederal Circuit noted that \u201cinventorship is determined on a claim-by- claim basis.\u201d  Trovan, 299 \nF.3d at 1302.  However, the Trovan Court was using this language simply to explain that in order \nto be a co -inventor on a patent, one need not make a contribution to the subject matter of every \nclaim  of a patent.  Id.  And importantly, in Trovan , the Federal Circuit was examining the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment regarding inventorship following a bench trial.  Id. at 1294, 1300.  Thus, the \nTrovan Court was clearly not making a point about pleading practice.  Nor was it in any way \nassessing the sufficiency of inventorship allegations found in a complaint.   15 \n Eastman v. Apple, Inc., Case No. 18- cv-05929-JST, 2019 WL 1559015, at *3 (N.D. Cal.

And if a complaint fails to allege sufficient  facts for \na court to understand how the purported co-inventor actually contribut ed to a concept that ended \nup in at least one identified claim of a patent , then how can the court conclude that a co -\ninventorship claim  is plausible  as to that patent?  See Beco Dairy Automation, Inc., 2015 WL \n925588, at *5 (concluding that a plaintiff did not plausibly allege that a person (\u201cLininger\u201d ) was \na joint inventor as to certain patents at issue, because although it was alleged that \u201cit was \nLininger \u2019s idea to add an additional metal ring to [an] existing flow meter\u201d the plaintiff \u201cfail[ed] \nto tie this work to any of the patents at issue\u201d in that the \u201cCourt cannot tell from [passages cited \nby the plaintiff] how Lininger\u2019s three- ring concept even applies to [a cited patent]\u201d) .12 \n There are some instances in the Complaint where Illumina does sufficiently identif y \ncertain concepts  and then explains how those concepts are found in at least one claim of certain \npatents -at-issue .  Thus, the Court can understand how it is that at least these \nconcepts /claims/patents  are assertedly relevant to Illumina\u2019s co -inventorship claim regarding \nEltoukhy.

(D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9 3-95; D.I. 41 at 17)  And in paragraph 58, \nthe Complaint seems to focus on claim 1 of the '731 patent\u2019s element of \u201cgrouping sequence \nreads into families, and then collapsing those reads into a single consensus sequence from the \nsequence reads in the families.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 58)13    \nHowever, t he dispositive problem with the inventorship claim relating to Eltoukhy is that \nthe Complaint does not contain facts making it plausible that Eltoukhy himself did in fact \ncontribute to or conceive of  the above- listed  concepts  found in the above- referenced patent \nclaims.   (D.I. 30 at 10-11; D.I. 45 at 2 (\u201cLike its complaint, Illumina\u2019s opposition says Dr. \n \n13  The Court notes that in paragraphs 54-56, the Complaint alleges that in December \n2012, Eltoukhy e- mailed certain \u201cdraft patent claims\u201d to his personal Gmail account, and then it \nlists out certain elements of those draft claims.  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 55-56)  But in these paragraphs, \nIllumina never specifies which claims o f which of the 35 patents  at issue  these elements are \nactually relevant to .  (Tr. at 183)  Similarly, in paragraph 51, the Complaint alleges that the \n\u201cGuardant patents disclose and claim\u201d certain concepts.  ( D.I. 1 at \u00b6 51)  But the Complaint \nnever articul ates what claims of which of the 35 patents incorporate these concepts.  As a result, \nthe Court will not consider these vague allegations further here.  \n \nThe Court also sees  that one of the elements referenced in one of the claims Eltoukhy \npurportedly drafted , pursuant to the allegations in paragraph 56 (\u201csequencing extracellular \npolynucleotides from a bodily sample from a subject, wherein each of the extracellular \npolynucleotide [s] are optionally attached to multiple barcodes\u201d) reads  somewhat similarly to the  \nelement of claim 10 of the '743 patent that Eltoukhy is said to have \u201ccontributed to[,]\u201d pursuant \nto the allegations in paragraph 93 (\u201csequencing extracellular polynucelotides from a bodily \nsample and mapping sequence reads derived from the sequencing onto a reference sequence\u201d) .  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 56, 93)  But that just raises the question:  Are the se two allegations meant to be linked ?  \nIn other words, did Illumina mean to allege that Eltoukhy drafted what became an element in \nclaim 10 of the '743 patent ?  If Illumina was intending this, it surely could have made that \nlinkage explicit in the Complaint.  In the absence of such an effort, the Court is not going to \nguess or speculate at what Plaintiff \u2019s allegations in this regard are meant to convey.   \n 17 \n Eltoukhy \u2018contributed to the conception and reduction to practice\u2019 of certain claim elements, but \nIllumina never alleges facts to support that bare conclusion.\u201d); Tr. at 179- 80)  With regard to the \nallegations in paragraphs 93-95, those paragraphs simply allege, in a conclusory manner, that \nEltoukhy \u201ccontributed\u201d to the listed concepts at issue.  But the Complaint points to no factual \nallegations  that would actually render th ese assertion s plausible.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 93-95; \nsee also D.I. 45 at 2)  W ith regard to the allegations in paragraphs 58, as the Court noted above, \nsee supra  n.7, the Complaint means to allege that this grouping/collapsing concept was contained \nin the communication theory slides that Steemers forwarded to Eltoukhy.  But the Complaint \nnever clearly asserts how , thereafter, Eltoukhy actually contributed to th at concept \u2014such that he \nshould be named as a joint inventor with regard to patents that include th e concept.  (D.I. 30 at \n11; Tr. at 168)  For this reason, the Court agrees with Defendants that Illumina\u2019s inventorship \nclaim as to Eltoukhy is insuffic iently pleaded, and recommends that it be dismissed.  See \nEastman, 2019 WL 1559015, at *3 (explaining that a plaintiff had not plausibly pleaded a \nSection 256 claim as to his own co-inventorship because although he \u201ccopie[d] the claim \nlanguage from numerous claims into his complaint\u201d he had \u201cidentifie[d] no relationship between \nhis notes and the claims themselves [,]\u201d and in his briefing had \u201cmerely identifie[d] similarities \nbetween [the plaintiff\u2019s] notes and the figures in the patents, rather than t he claims that a llegedly \nentitle him to inventorship\u201d) ; see also Ecojet, Inc. v.

First, Defendants argue that Illumina fails to identify its trade secrets  with \nreasonable particularity .  (D.I. 30 at 17-19; D.I. 45 at 6-7)  Second, Defendants contend that, to \nthe extent that Illumina has identified any trade secrets with particularity, Illumina\u2019s claim is nevertheless time -barred.

Has Illumina identified its trade secrets wit h \nparticularity ? \n \nCount II of Illumina\u2019s Complaint references two examples of Illumina\u2019s trade secret \ninformation purportedly misappropriated by Defendants:  (1) the communication theory slides \nthat Steemers provided to Eltoukhy, which included \u201cproprietary and confidential concepts for \nimproving error rates for random encoding using barcodes for use in genetic sequencing[;]\u201d and \n(2) the 51,000 documents that Eltoukhy took from Illumina, which contained \u201ctrade secret \ninformation[.]\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 105-06; see also Tr. at 86-87)  Earlier allegations in the Complaint \nprovide a bit more detail regarding these two examples .  With respect to the communication \ntheory slides, the Complaint further alleges: \n57.  Materials that Eltoukhy obtained from Illumina employees \nincluded, by way of example, Illumina\u2019s confidential and \nproprietary error correction methods and communication theory \nideas, including methods for grouping sequence reads into families \nand then collapsing those reads into a single consensus sequence \nfrom the sequence reads in the families.  Eltoukhy and Talasaz \nused this information in Guardant patent applications and claims, \nincluding in systems and methods to detect rare mutations and \ncopy number variations. \n \n(D.I. 1 at \u00b6 57; see also supra n.7)  As for the 51,000 documents, the Complaint alleges:  \n \n65.  When Eltoukhy left Illumina, he took with him, without \nauthority or permission, more than 51,000 Illumina- owned emails.  \n \n66.  The emails that Eltoukhy took from Illumina included more \nthan 1,400 documents specifically labeled \u201cCOMPANY \nCONFIDENTIAL \u2014INTERNAL USE ONLY.\u201d  \n \n(D.I. 1  at \u00b6\u00b6  65-66) \n \n Taking up the 51,000 documents first, the Court easily agrees with Defendants that no \nclaim has been stated.  This  bald reference to an incredibly expansive am ount of material does \nnot suffice to \u201cpermit the defendant to ascertain at least the boundaries \u201d of any trade secrets said 20 \n to have been misappropriated.

Oct. 24, 2013) ( \u201c[A plaintiff\u2019s ] vague references to an enormous array of potential sources \n[as containing its misappropriated trade secrets ] do not suffice to survive Defendant\u2019s motion to \ndismiss. \u201d); (Tr.  at 88).16  \n The Court turns next to the information set out in the communication theory slides, which \nis (at least in part) specifically described in the latter portion of paragraph 57 (i.e., \u201cmethods for \ngrouping sequence reads into families and then collapsing those reads into a single consensus \nsequence from the sequence reads in the families\u201d ).  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6 57)  During oral argument, \nIllumina \u2019s counsel acknowledged that this is the most specific articulation of a category of trade \nsecrets  in the Complaint\u2014indeed, that it is the only specific  category of trade secrets set out  \ntherein .  (Tr. at 80-81, 91-93; see also  D.I. 41 at 23)  Other allegations in the Complaint include \nslightly broader references to this category of trade secrets  and also indicate that it is referenced \nin the communication theory slides.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 1 at \u00b6 41 ( alleging that Eltoukhy requested \nthe slide presentation from Steemers containing confidential Illumina information \u201cconcerning \nrandom coding improvement in error rate for use in genetic sequencing to obtain better accuracy \nfrom fewer sequence reads\u201d) )   \n \n16  To the extent that Illumina suggests that the decision of the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Cir cuit in Oakwood Lab\u2019 ys LLC  v. Thanoo, 999 F.3d 892 (3d Cir. 2021) \nallows for a plaintiff to broadly cite to thousands of documents\u2014with no further indication of \nwhat is contained in those documents\u2014in order to satisfy the requirement that a trade secret be identified with particularity, (D.I. 41 at 22; Tr. at 110-13), the Court does not agree , (see Tr. at \n66, 132).  In that case, the plaintiff had described its trade secrets with specificity, and had attached  certain documents that specified in detail particular trade secrets  at issue .  Oakwood, \n999 F.3d at 907.  Illumina has done no such thing with respect to the 51,000 documents it cites in the Complaint.   21 \n  The Court concludes that Illumina has identified this particular category of trade secrets \n\u2014i.e., those relating to using \u201cmethods for grouping sequence reads into families and then \ncollapsing those reads into a single consensus sequence from the sequence reads in the families\u201d \nin the relevant context\u2014with sufficient particularity.  Here the Complaint describes the \nparticular method  at issue, and further identifies specific documents that purportedly disclose th e \ntrade secret.  This suffices to put Defendants on notice with respect to \u201cat least the boundaries \nwithin which the secret lies.\u201d  See, e.g., HotSpot Therapeutics, Inc. v. Nurix Therapeutics, Inc., \nCase No. 22- cv-04109- TSH, 2022 WL 16637988, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2022) (finding that \nthe plaintiff\u2019s complaint identified its trade secrets with sufficient particularity , where it set out \nthe subject matter in question (E3 ubiquitin ligases, DELs, certain identified software, and \nconfidential information found in a particular agreement) ).17   \n Therefore, the  Court recommends that the Motion be granted with respect to Illumina\u2019s \ntrade secret claim  on insufficiency-of-pleading grounds, with the exception of the category of \n \n17 Defendants also argue in their  opening brief ( in a single sentence ) that Illumina \nhas failed to allege how the purported trade secrets derive independent economic value or \nwhether they were subject to reasonable measures to maintain their secrecy.  (D.I. 30 at 18-19; see also Tr. at 64)  The Court is not persuaded.  ( See D.I. 41 at 23; Tr. at 104-06)  The Complaint \nalleges that :  (1) Illumina has \u201cinvested substantial resources in research and development, \nincluding related to methods for improving error rates for random encoding using barcodes for use in genetic sequencing[;]\u201d and (2) Illumina employs \u201cstringent security measures to preserve \nthe secrecy of its trade secrets, including by requiring employees to sign various agreements and company policies and to return any Illumina information in their possession upon termination of employment.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 107, 109)  This is sufficient to satisfy these requirements at the pleading stage.  See, e.g., Moement, Inc. v. Groomore, Inc., Case No. 2:22- cv-02871- MWF \n(JEMx), 2022 WL 18284405, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 29, 2022) (\u201cCourts have found that requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements respecting its trade secrets is a sufficiently reasonable step to ensure the secrecy of their information.\u201d); Heska Corp. v. Qorvo US, Inc., 1:19CV1108, 2020 WL 5821078, at *6 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 30, 2020) (finding that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged facts indicating that the trade secret produced some form of economic value, \nwhere the complaint  asserted that, inter alia , the plaintiff expended $500,000 on research and \ndevelopment of the instrument product ).  \n 22 \n trade secrets described in  the latter portion of paragraph 57 of the Complaint.18  As to that \nsurviving aspect of Count II, the Court now considers whether the claim is nevertheless time -\nbarred.     \nii. Is  Illumina\u2019s trade secret claim time- barred ? \n \nDefendants argue that the category of trade secrets identified in paragraph 57 \ndemonstrates  that Illumina\u2019s claim comes years too late .  This is purportedly because the same \ninformation was used by Eltoukhy and Talasaz in patent applications filed in 2015 and 2016\u2014\napplications that later i ssued as patents in 2017 and  2018.  (D.I. 30 at 19 -20; see also D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 \n50, 57)  Thus, Defendants argue, Illumina has been on constructive notice of any misappropriation since the n, and its claims are time -barred.  (D.I. 30 at 20)\n19   \nTrade secret misappropriation claims brought under CUTSA are subject to a three- year \nstatute of limitations, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3426.6, which begins to run when there is actual or constructive notice of a claim, Wang v. Palo Alto Networks, Inc., No. C 121-05579 WHA, 2014 WL 1410346, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 11, 2014).  To that end, a trade secret misappropriation claim does not accrue \u201cuntil the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover,\u201d the underlying facts.  \n \n18  The parties suggested that there could be future disputes relating to the scope of \ndiscovery with respect to Illumina\u2019s surviving trade secret claim.  ( See Tr. at 96-99, 133-37)  The \nparties may utilize the Court\u2019s discovery dispute procedures to the extent that any such disputes \nmaterialize.  That said , the parties should be mindful of the guidance that the Court has set out in \nBoston Sci. Corp. v. Nevro Corp., Civil Action No. 16-1163- CFC -CJB, 2020 WL 5095447, at \n*6-7 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2020) regarding the appropriate scope of trade secret discovery.   \n \n19  In raising this argument, Defendants are asserting that the applicability of an \naffirmative defense should lead to dismissal of this claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  (Tr. at 20)  A district court may dismiss a claim on the basis of the applicability of an affirmative defense .  \nBut it may do so only if the defense is evident from the face of the complaint at issue and no development of the factual record is required to determine whether dismissal is appropriate.  ECB USA, Inc. v. Savencia, S.A ., Civil Action No. 19-731- RGA- CJB, 2020 WL 11762200, at \n*12 n.14 (D. Del. July 10, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 5369076 (D. Del. Sep. 8, 2020). 23 \n Brocade Commc\u2019ns Sys., Inc. v. A10 Networks, I nc., 873 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1217 (N.D. Cal. \n2012), on reconsideration in part , 2012 WL 12925716 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2012).  In order to rely \non the discovery rule for delayed accrual of a cause of action , a plaintiff whose complaint \notherwise demonstrates on its face that its claim would be time -barred must specifically plead \nfacts showing:  (1) the time and manner of discovery ; and (2) the inability to have made earlier \ndiscovery notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s reasonable diligence.  Wolf v. Travolta , No. 2:14- CV-\n938-CAS (VBKx), 2014 WL 6685560, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 24, 2014).   \nIllumina contends that, as detailed in its  Complaint, it did not discover any of the \nmisappropriation until at least June 2019, when it responded to discovery requests in the FMI \nlitigation; this was less than three years before Illumina  filed suit in March 2022.  (D.I. 41 at 6-7 \n(citing D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 75-78))  In support of this assertion, Illumina argues that :  (1) the \npatents /applications  do not on their face flatly reveal Defendants\u2019 misappropriation; and (2) even \nif they did, Defendants\u2019 fraudulent concealment of the misappropriation tolled  the relevant \nstatute of limitations.  ( Id. at 7-8; Tr. at 72-73)  The doctrine of fraudulent concealment \u201c tolls the \nstatute of limitations  where a defendant, through deceptive conduct, has caused a claim to grow \nstale.\u201d  Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Sols., Inc., 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 1192 (Cal. 2013).  In order to \nsufficiently allege the applicability of the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, a plaintiff must \nplead \u201c(1) knowledge of the true facts by the party to be estopped, (2) intent to induce reliance or \nactions giving rise to a belief in that intent, (3) ignorance of the true facts by the relying party, \nand (4) detrimental reliance.\u201d  IQVIA  Inc. v. MedImpact Healthcare Sys.,  Inc., Case No. 21- CV-\n2081- GPC -DEB, 2022 WL 1125779, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2022) (internal quotation marks \nand citation s omitted).   A claim of fraudulent concealment must satisfy Federal Rule of Civil 24 \n Procedure 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirements.  Thibodeaux  v. Teamsters  Loc.  853, 263 F. \nSupp. 3d 772, 778 (N.D. Cal. 2017). \nAt this early juncture, t he Complaint\u2019s surviving trade se cret misappropriation allegations \nare sufficient to escape Defendants \u2019 statute of limitations defense.  Cf. S. Cross Overseas \nAgencies, Inc. v. Wah Kwong Shipping Grp. Ltd., 181 F.3d 410, 425 (3d Cir. 1999) (\u201cWhen the \napplicability of the statute of limitations is in dispute , there are usually factual questions as to \nwhen a plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the elements of its cause of action, and thus defendants bear a heavy burden in seeking to establish as a matter of law that the chal lenged \nclaims are [ time] barred .\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Despite any \nsuggestion by Defendants to the contrary, there is not a per se  rule that if a patent application  or \npatent issue s and it contains  misappropriated trade secrets, then th is starts the statute of \nlimitations clock ticking in every case.   And here, it is not clear  (based on the allegations of the \nComplaint ) that even if Illumina were on notice of the content of these patents/applications when \nthey issue d, it w ould have had reasonable suspicion that the alleged misappropriation had \noccurred.  It also seems plausible \u2014again, at least at this early stage, with only the Complaint\u2019s \nallegations to guide us \u2014that  Illumina might have reasonab ly believed that its trade secrets ended \nup in the patents /applications  through independent discovery on the part of Talasaz and/or \nEltoukhy.  (Tr. at 117- 18, 120- 21); cf. Gen. Bedding Corp. v. Echevarria, 947 F.2d 1395, 1396, \n1398 (9th Cir. 1991) ( reversing the district court\u2019s decision at summary judgment that, as to a \nCalifornia state fraud claim, the statute of limitations had run ; the court did so in light of the \nplaintiff\u2019s argument that the issuance of a patent did not constitute constructive notice of the \nplaint iff\u2019s claims against the defendants , because \u201cBrandau\u2019s name was not on the patent, a [nd so 25 \n a] reasonable person might not infer from the patent\u2019s existence that fraud had occurred\u201d and  \n\u201c[t]he patent could instead be the result of an independent discovery by\u201d the defendant).  \nMoreover, t he Complaint alleges  a number of facts that sufficiently demonstrat e the \napplicability of the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.  These allegations i nclude that, inter alia :  \n(1) the Individual Defendants anonymously incorporated Guardant while still employed at \nIllumina in December 2011; (2) Talasaz left employment at Illumina in June 2012; (3) Eltoukhy concealed that he was working for Guardant while still employed by Illumina, including by failing to tell Steemers that he was requ esting the communication theory slides for non- Illumina \nrelated work ; (4) Eltoukhy used his personal e- mail address to transmit Illumina\u2019s confidential \ninformation to Guardant; (5) Eltoukhy took 51,000 documents from Illumina without permission; and (6) Guardant removed Eltoukhy as a named inventor from certain patent applications before they issued as patents.  (D.I . 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28, 39, 45, 50, 55, 65, 69, 72-74)  Defendants\u2019 alleged \ndeception could in turn have prevented Illumina from discovering the misappropriation.  It \nmight, for example, have helped l ull Illumina  into believing that Talasaz and/or Eltoukhy were \nnot a threat to Illumina\u2019s innovation efforts\u2014and that Talasaz and/or Eltoukhy might have independently discovered the material later disclosed in these patents/applications.  (D.I. 41 at 8-9; Tr. at 25, 74, 117)   \nTherefore, after construing the allegations in the light most favorable to Illumina, it is \nplausible th at it was not able to discover Defendants\u2019 alleged misappropriation until a time \nperiod within the relevant statute of limitations \u2014particularly in light of Defendants\u2019 alleged \nfraudulent concealment of key facts.  Cf. Keith Mfg., Co. v. Butterfield , Case No. 3:15- cv-2008-\nSI, 2016 WL 4134555, at *11 (D. Or. Aug. 2, 2016) (\u201c Keith \u2019s inability to discover the \nmisappropriation may have resulted from Butterfield\u2019s fraudulent concealment of when he 26 \n developed the patent design and Loadbacker busi ness.  Butterfield is free to present factual \nevidence to the contrary at summary judgment or trial.\u201d).    \nc. Has Illumina Pleaded Actionable Breach of Contract Claims ?  \n \n In Counts III and IV of the Complaint, Illumina alleges breach of contract claims against \nthe Individual Defendants.  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6  121-42)  But the Complaint does not attach copies of the \nrelevant contract s.  Nor does it expressly lay out the specific pro visions of such contracts that \nwere allegedly breached . \nInstead , the Complaint alleges:  \n18.  As part of their employment with Illumina, Eltoukhy and \nTalasaz entered into and agreed to employment contracts and company policies, including a Proprietary Information and Invention Agreement (\u201cPIIA\u201d), Confidentiality \u2013 Disclosure on Need -To-Know Basis Only Acknowledgement (\u201cConfidentiality \nAcknowledgement\u201d), Code of Ethics, and, at the end of their employment, a Termination Certificate.  \n 19.  The employment agreements and company policies to which Eltoukhy and Talasaz agreed required them to devote thei r efforts \nto Illumina\u2019s business, to not compete with Illumina, to avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise their loyalty to Illumina, to assign to Illumina their inventions made while employed by Illumina that are related to Illumina\u2019s business, to protect Illumina\u2019s confidential and proprietary information, to not take or use Illumina\u2019s resources and property for their personal benefit, and to return Illumina materials to the company upon termination of their employment.  . . .  \n 125.  Eltoukhy ma terially breached the PIIA, the Confidentiality \nAcknowledgement, and Code of Ethics, respectively, in numerous ways and at numerous times, including for example but without limitation:  Eltoukhy\u2019s efforts (with Talasaz) to incorporate Guardant in 2011; Eltoukhy\u2019s acting as an advisor, corporate agent, and fiduciary of Guardant while employed by Illumina; Eltoukhy\u2019s forwarding of Illumina confidential and proprietary information outside of Illumina and to non- Illumina employees; \nEltoukhy\u2019s transfer outside Illumina, including to Guardant, of thousands of Illumina proprietary documents, including more than 1,400 \u201cCOMPANY CONFIDENTIAL\u201d documents, when he 27 \n separated from Illumina in January 2013; and Eltoukhy\u2019s \ncontribution to the development of Guardant\u2019s technology while an employee of Illumina, including by using proprietary information provided by other Illumina personnel and drafting patent claims ultimately obtained in Guardant\u2019s name. These actions, among others, violate at least Sections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e), 3(h), and 3(i) of the PIIA, Paragraphs 2, 4, 5, and 9 of the Confidentiality Acknowledgement, and Sections 1 and 4 of the Code of Ethics.   126.  Eltoukhy\u2019s knowing and willful misappropriation of Illumina\u2019s trade secrets also violates and brea ches at least \nParagraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the Illumina Termination Certificate that he signed when he separated from Illumina in January 2013. . . .  136.  Talasaz materially breached the PIIA, the Confidentiality Acknowledgement, and Code of Ethics, respectively, in numerous ways and at numerous times, including for example but without limitation:  Talasaz\u2019s efforts (with Eltoukhy) to incorporate Guardant in 2011; and Talasaz knowingly receiving Illumina confidential and proprietary information from Eltoukhy and using the same to develop Guardant\u2019s technology and intellectual property.  These actions, among others, violate at least Sections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e), 3(h), and 3(i) of the PIIA, Paragraphs 2, 4, 5, and 9 of the Confidentiality Acknowledgement, and Sections 1 and 4 of the Code of Ethics.  137.  Talasaz\u2019s knowing and willful misappropriation of Illumina\u2019s trade secrets also violates and breaches at least Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the Illumina Termination Certificate that he signed when he separated from Illumina.  \n \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 125-26, 136-37) \n Under California law, a plaintiff bringing a breach of contract claim must either \u201cattach a \ncopy of the contract to the complaint or plead the essential terms of the contract.\u201d  Gross v. Symantec Corp., No. C 12-00154 CRB, 2012 WL 3116158, at *11 (N.D. Cal. July 31, 2012) ; see \nalso Langan v. United Servs. Auto. Ass \u2019n, 69 F. Supp. 3d 965, 979 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (citing \nCalifornia law to this effect) .\n20  Defendants assert that Illumina\u2019s breach of contract  claims are \n \n20  Although Illumina\u2019s Complaint does not specify what state\u2019s law applies to its \nbreach of contract claims, its briefing suggests that Califor nia law applies.  (D.I. 41 at 24-25; Tr. 28 \n insufficiently pleaded because the Complaint fails to identify the essential terms of any contract \nallegedly breached by the Individual Defendants.  (D.I. 30 at 23- 24; D.I. 45 at 8)  Instead, \naccording to Defendants , the allegations lea ve it \u201cundefined and open- ended\u201d as to  (1) wh ich \nconduct is said to have breached (2) which provisions of (3) which contract at issue .  (Tr. at 205-\n06)  The Court agrees with Defendants .   \nWhile paragraph 19 of the Complaint makes reference to  the substance of the key \ncontractual provisions at issue , it does not specify the wording of those provisions .  Instead, it \njust summarizes the provisions  in a fairly broad manner .  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6  19)  This gives the Court \nsome pause, because i t makes it ha rder to assess whether certain challenged conduct plausibly \namounts to a breach of th e actual contract requirements at issue.   \nBut even if the Court were to look past that problem , more troublesome is that paragraph \n19 fails to indicate  which of the contr acts at issue contain which of these allegedly -breached \nprovisions .  (Id.; Tr. at 215- 16, 219)  From there, paragraphs 125 and 136 broadly set out \nexemplary conduct at issue that , \u201camong other[]\u201d unspecified actions, is  said to violate \u201cat least\u201d \ncertain provisions of the PIIA, Confidentiality Acknowledgement and Code of Ethics .  (D.I. 1  at \n\u00b6\u00b6 125, 136)  And w hile paragraphs 126 and 137 identify expansive  conduct said to violate \u201cat \nleast\u201d certain provisions of the relevant Termi nation Certificates, the Complaint never makes \nclear what the essential terms of those provisions are.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  126, 137)  This lack of clarity \nleaves the reader unsure of exactly what conduct of the Individual Defendants is said to breach which provisi on of which particular contract  referenced in the Complaint .  In light of this  \nopaqueness , the Court recommends that the breach of contract claims be dismissed.  See, e.g., \n \nat 214- 15)  Defendants also rel y on California law, and so that is the law that the Court will \nutilize here.  (D.I. 30 at 23- 24)   29 \n AK Futures LLC v.

Legal Standard  \n \n21  Defendants also argue that Illumina\u2019s breach of contract claims are barred by \nCalifornia\u2019s four -year statute of limitations , because the alleged breaches were reasonably \ndiscoverable through publicly available information.  (D.I. 30 at 21-23; D.I. 45 at 8-9)  Illumina \nretorts that the breach of contract claims are timely because, due t o Defendants\u2019 acts of \nfraudulent concealment, they did not accrue until Illumina discovered the breaches in or around \nJune 2019 and thereafter .  (D.I. 41 at 9- 10)  However, as the Court has explained above, the \ncurrent allegations do not provide sufficient notice with respect to which provisions of which \ncontracts were breached by which activity .  And without the necessary understanding of the \nbreach of contract claims, the Court cannot in turn assess the parties\u2019 arguments as to wh en these \nclaims began to accrue .   30 \n  Rule 12(b)(2) directs courts to dismiss a case when the court lacks p ersonal jurisdiction \nover the defendant.

BCD Semiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365, 369 (D. Del. 2008).  In a case like this one, where a district court has not held an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff must only make a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists.  See Perlight Solar Co.

First, the Court must consider \nwhether there is a basis for exercising personal juris diction pursuant to Delaware state law.  See \nHardwire , 2014 WL 5144610, at *6;  see also Power Integrations , 547 F. Supp. 2d at 369.  \nSecond, the Court must determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with the defendant\u2019s right to due process.  Hardwire , 2014 WL 5144610, at *6; Power Integrations , 547 \nF. Supp. 2d at 369 (citing Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).  Due process is satisfied where the court finds that \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d exist between the defendant 31 \n and the forum state \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.\u201d  Int\u2019l Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at  316 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation s omitted).   \n2. Discussion  \nWith regard to the statutory bas is for jurisdiction, Illumina asserts that this Court has \npersonal jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants, who are officers of Guardant\u2014a Delaware corporation\u2014pursuant to, inter alia , Del. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 3114, the nondirector officer and \nconsent stat ute (\u201cSection 3114\u201d).  (D.I. 41 at 11-15; see also D.I.  1 at \u00b6 15)\n22  Illumina\u2019s \nComplaint further alleges with respect to this issue:  \n15. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants. . . . \nEltoukhy and Talasaz incorporated Guardant in Delaware, and did so while employed by Illumina.  Eltoukhy and Talasaz founded Guardant based on misappropriated confidential information from Illumina and assigned the patents at issue in this action to \nGuardant, a Delaware corporation.  Defendants have filed and participated in patent litigation in Delaware, including [the FMI litigation].  Those cases involved patents at issue in this action.  \nDefendants Eltoukhy and Talasaz are directors and officers of \nGuardant [.]  \n(D.I. 1 at \u00b6 15)   \nDefendants do  not dispute that Illumina has pleaded a statutory basis for jurisdiction \nunder Section 3114.  (D.I. 45 at 9-10; Tr. at 226-27)  Instead, the issue in dispute is whether th e \nCourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction would comport with due process.  (D.I. 45 at 9-10; Tr. at 226-27)   \n \n22  Section 3114 provides a statutory basis for personal  jurisdiction  over non- resident \ndirectors of Delaware corporations in:  (1) \u201call civil actions or proceedings brought in [Delaware] \n. . . against such corporation, in which such officer is a necessary or proper party[;] \u201d or (2) \u201cin  \nany action or proceeding against such officer for violation of a duty in such capacity[.]\u201d  Del. \nCode tit. 10, \u00a7 3114(b); see also Hazout v.  Tsang Mun  Ting, 134 A.3d 274, 277 (Del. 2016). 32 \n On that front, Illumina contends that personal jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants \nis consistent with due process because they \u201cserved as directors and officers of a Delaware \ncorporation; indeed, as founders, they chose  to incorporate in Delaware [,]\u201d thus purposefully \navailing themselves of certain duties and protections under Delaware law, such that they should \nreasonably anticipate being sued in Delaware.   (D.I. 41 at 14-15 (emphasis in original) (citing \nHazout v. Tsang Mun Ting, 134 A.3d 274, 292 (Del. 2016) ; AeroGlobal Cap. Mgmt., LLC v. \nCirrus Indus., Inc., 871 A.2d 428, 440 (Del. 2005)).  Meanwhile, Defendants contend that courts have repeatedly held that serving as officers and directors of a Delaware corporation and choosing to incorporate in Delaware is insufficient, in and of itself, to satisfy the due process prong of the personal jurisdiction in quiry.  (D.I. 45 at 10; Tr. at 236-37)   \nThe Court next turns to relevant caselaw.  In Hazout v. Tsang Mun Ting, 134 A.3d 274 \n(Del. 2016), the Supreme Court of Delaware explained that utilizing a minimum contacts due process analysis following application of Section 3114 helps to  ensure that the statute is not \napplied too broadly.  Hazout , 134 A.3d at 288, 291.  As an example, the Hazout  Court posited a \nhypothetical.  It explained that if plaintiffs sued officers and directors of a Delaware corporation in a products liability case where the products at issue were designed and distributed outside of Delaware to non -residents, then the minimum contacts test would \u201cprovide substantial \nprotection\u201d to those defendants.  Id.  at 291 n.60.  That is because even if Section 3114 would be \nsatisfied  in such a case, subsequent application of the minimum contacts test would p revent \nDelaware from exercising personal jurisdiction:  \n[W]he[ re] Delaware\u2019s status as the state of incorporation had no \nrational connection to the cause of action, where the conduct is \ngoverned by the laws of other states, and where there is no reason \nwhy a corporate fiduciary should expect to be named as a party at \nall, much less in a suit where the underlying conduct and claims 33 \n have no rational connection to Delaware and provide no rational \nbasis for Delaware to apply its own law. \n \nId.   \nIn Hazout , the plaintiff sued the CEO of a Delaware corporation based in Canada ; the \nCEO resided in Canada.  Id. at 277.  Pursuant to a series of agreements specifying that Delaware \nlaw would govern, the plaintiff had lent the corporation money, which the CEO then diverted to \nanother corporation that he controlled.  Id.  The CEO brought a motion to dismiss, asserting that \nthere was no basis for a Delaware state court to exercise personal jurisdiction over him.  Id.   \nAfter finding that Section 3114 applied, the Hazout  Court concluded that the due process \nanalysis was easily satisfied , because:  (1) the CEO had purposefully availed himself of certain \nduties and protections under Delaware law by becoming the head of a Delaware corporation ; and \n(2) the \u201cconduct underlying all the claims was in fact Delaware-focused and involved parties \nusing Delaware law as their language of commerce in negotiating the change of control of a \nDelaware corporation.\u201d  Id. at 289-90; see also id . at 292-93; cf. AeroGlobal Cap. Mgmt. , 871 \nA.2d at 4 40, 442 (finding that the due process requirement was satisfied where the defendant  \n(\u201cFIIB \u201d) executed with a Delaware corporation two stock purchase agreements calling for \nDelaware law to govern , had negotiated the agreements through its Delaware subsidiary, and \nwhere it was reasonable to infer that, by operating its Delaware subsidiary for commercial gain, \nFIIB benefited from Delaware law , such that Delaware had a legitimate interest in resolving the \nplaintiff\u2019s claims); Papendick v. Bosch , 410 A.2d 148, 152 (Del. 1979) (finding due process to be \nsatisfied where the foreign defendant \u201ccame into the State of Delaware to create, under the \nDelaware Corporation Law, a subsidiary corporation for the purpose of implementing\u201d the \ncontract that was at issue in the lawsuit).     34 \n In contra st, in BAM Int\u2019l, LLC v. MSBA Grp. Inc., C.A. No. 2021-0181-SG, 2021 WL \n5905878 (Del. Ch. Dec. 14, 2021), the Delaware Court of Chancery found that while Section \n3114 was satisfied, the minimum contacts due process analysis was not.  It did so where the \ndefendants were officers of a Delaware corporation that was headquartered in California, and :  \n(1) the lawsuit did not involve the corporation\u2019s status as a Delaware corporation ; (2) the \ncontract at issue was a commercial one and the action did not implicate Delaware\u2019s corporate \nlaw; (3) the escrow account at issue was located in Utah and its funds would be distributed to a \nMalaysian  supplier; (4) the harms alleged to have been committed did not implicate fiduciary \nduties or corporate governance practices; and (5) the tortious actions giving rise to the \ndefendants\u2019 liability were not taken as officers of the corporation.  BAM Int\u2019l , 2021 WL \n5905878, at *10.  With \u201cDelaware [having] no real interest\u201d in the case, the Court concluded that \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction would not comport with due process.  Id. at *10-11; see also, \ne.g., Turf Nation, Inc.  v. UBU Sports, Inc. , C.A. No.: N17C-01-271 EMD  CCLD, 2017 WL \n4535970, at *9 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 11, 2017) (finding that even though Section 3114 may be \nsatisfied, due process was not, where the plaintiff\u2019s claims were brought under the laws of states \nother than Delaware; the conduct giving rise to the claims occurred outside of Delaware and \nthere were no claims that the individual defendant \u201cmisused his position\u201d at the corporation; the \nDelaware corporations\u2019 principal places of business were outside of Delaware; and the \nagreement at issue called for the application of Georgia law). \nHere, on the one hand, (1) both Illumina and Guardant are headquartered in California; \n(2) the Individual Defendants also reside there; (3) Illumina\u2019s trade secret misappropriation \nclaims are brought under California law; (4) Illumina\u2019s breach of contract claims do not indicate what state\u2019s laws apply , though it s briefing suggests that California law applies ; and (5) the 35 \n conduct at issue took place in California.  ( See D.I. 45 at 10; Tr. at 214-15, 236-37)  Yet on the \nother hand, the Complaint a lleges that the Individual Defendants , while still employed at \nIllumina :  (1) took action to anonymously incorporate Guardant in here Delaware, and then, \nhaving created that Delaware corporate entity (2)  improperly assigned the 35 patents at issue \u2014\npatents that they allegedly obtained by misappropriating Illumina\u2019s confident ial information \u2014to \nGuardant.  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6  2, 3, 15, 26; D.I. 41 at 13-14)   \nWhile it is not a clear -cut call, in the Court\u2019s view, Defendants have pleaded enough to \nsatisfy the due process requirement.  This matter  is different from the Hazout Court\u2019s  products \nliability case hypothetical, as well as from the circumstances at play in  cases like  BAM Int\u2019l and \nTurf Nation (cited above).  In all of those situations, the relevant entity\u2019s  incorporation in \nDelaware bore no relation to the claims at is sue\u2014i.e., those entities were not formed , in \nDelaware, for the purpose of facilitating alleged wrongdoing.  In this case, however, like in the \nAeroGlobal and Papendick  cases (also cited above),  the allegations do have a tie to Delaware.  \nHere, the Individual Defendants are alleged to have founded Guardant\u2014and incorporated it in Delaware\u2014at least partially for the purpose of enabling the corporation to wrongfully obtain various patents , which in turn could then be assign ed to Guardant ( instead of  Illumina ).  (Tr. at \n238-42)  Thus, the Individual Defendants cannot fairly say that they \u201cdid not foresee that [they] would be subject to litigation in Delaware over [their] conduct\u201d at issue here, and requiring them \nto defend Illumina\u2019s claims in Delawar e would not \u201coffend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.\u201d  Hazout , 134 A.3d at 293-94 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .   \nFor these reasons, the Court recommends that the Motion be denied as to the personal \njurisdiction challenge. III. CONCLUSION 36 \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the Motion be GRANTED- IN-\nPART and DENIED -IN-PART .  Specifically, it recommends that the M otion be GRANTED as \nto Illumina\u2019s inventorship claim and breach of contract claims ; GRANTED with respect to \nIllumina\u2019s trade secret misappropriation claim, with the exception of the portion of the claim \nrelating to the  category of trade secrets described in the latter part of paragraph 57 of the \nComplaint (i.e., \u201cgrouping sequence reads . . .\u201d); and DENIED  with respect to the assertion that \nthere is no personal jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants.   \nIll umina requested leave to amend should the Court grant any portion of the Motion.  \n(D.I. 41 at 25)  Because it is not clear to the Court that allowing the opportunity to amend  would \nbe a futile act, because this is the first time the Court has found any of Illumina\u2019s claims to be \ndeficiently pleaded, and because leave to  amend  should be given freely \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires[,]\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), the Court recommends that dismissal be without prejudice \nand that Illumina be given leave to file an amended complaint addressing the deficiencies \noutlined above.  The Court also recommends that if the District Court affirms its decision herein, \nIllumina  be given no more than 30 days to file such an amended  complaint.  \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections \nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.
