Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n December  6, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Devon Austin Ear l appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4).  He  alleges violations of his  constitutional rights \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and raises claims under Delaware law. 0F1  (D.I. 2).  Plaintiff \nhas filed a motion for leave to issue service of summons and a motion to expedite \nservice of summons. 1F2  (D.I. 5, 6).   The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff names twenty -seven defendants:  The individual \ndefendants are named either in their individual and official capacities  or solely  in their \nofficial capacities .  (See  D.I. 2 -1, list of defendants).  \n Plaintiff is  employed by  Defendant University of Delaware.  (D.I . 2 at \u00b6 5).  In \nMarch 2020, Defendant New Castle County Police Officer  Brandon Harris stopped \nPlaintiff  for \u201can alleged \u2018traffic violation. \u2019\u201d  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 40).  Plaintiff alleges that Harris \n\u201carbitrarily pulled- over/seized/detained/arrested and cited\u201d him , that Harris failed to \n \n1 The Complaint alleges that the action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, \n1988, the Articles ( presumably the Articles of the Constitution) and Fourth, Fifth, Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the laws of Delaware.  ( See D.I. 2 at \u00b6 \u00b6 4, 5 , 39).   The \nComplaint\u2019s eleven co unts raise claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Counts I, V , VI, VII, \nVIII, IX) , claims under Delaware law  (Counts II, III, IV), and \u201ccivil rights\u201d claims  (Counts \nX, XI) .   \n2 The motions will be dismissed without prejudice as premature.  2 \n produce a lawful warrant for the stop and seizure, and that Harris failed to articulate \nprobable cause during the detainment, arrest, and citation.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41).  Plaintiff \nwas charged with failure to have required insurance, 21 Del. C. \u00a7 2118,  and having a \nfictitious or canceled registration, 21 Del. C. \u00a7 2115, Case No. 2002015749, Arrest Number T322003375.  (D.I. 2 at Ex. E).    \n On June 7, 2022, Plaintiff was arrested by Defendant University of Delaware \nPolice Officer Jessica Zeilman \u201cunder false and misleading pretenses of being a \u2018private \nmatter\u2019 via his employers orders to go to the University Police  Station.\u201d  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 5 5).  \nPlaintiff alleges that \u201ca waiver of ri ghts to replacement of venue under color of law was \ncoercively presented to [him]  by [] Zeilman, to which it was signed under duress.\u201d  ( Id. at \n\u00b6 56).   Following his arrest , University of Delaware ordered Plai ntiff to appear before \nHuman Resources .  (Id. at \u00b6 59).  Plaintiff was reprimanded for having an \u201calleged \n\u2018suspended license\u2019\u201d and suspended for one day with no pay  ( Id.). \n On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff mailed an intent to sue to all Defendants.  ( Id. at \u00b6 65).   \n During the cour se of the traffic  proceedi ngs, Plaintiff sent service copies to \nnumerous defendants  including  Delaware Governor John Carney , Delaware State \nProsecutor AJ Roop, Chief Magistrate of Justice of the Peace Court No. 11 Alan Davis, Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles  Jana Simpler , Secretary of Delaware \nDepartment of Transportation Nicole Majeski , Officer Zeilman,  Magistrate of Justice of \nthe Peace Court Maria Perez -Chambers , New Castle County Executive Matthew  Meyer, \nNew Castle County Police Chief Colonel Joseph S. Bloch, University of Delaware Chief of Police Patrick Ogden, Officer Harris, New Cast le County Court of Common Pleas \nChief Judge Carl C. Danber g, Justice of the Peace Court No. 11 Magistrate Judge 3 \n Alexander Peterson,  III, New Castle County Court of Common Pleas C lerk Carol \nLemieux , Justice of the Peace Court  11, the State of Delaware, the Delaware \nDepartment of Transportation,  and the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 \u00b6 \n51, 52, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64).   \n Attachments to the Complaint provide the followin g timeline.  \nJuly 29, 2020.  Plaintiff  failed to appear for arraignment  in Case No. \n2002015749.   He is given a deadline of August 12, 2020 to contact the \nJustice of the Peace Court 11 to reschedule.  (D.I. 2 at Ex.

P ).  \n \n3 Plaintiff alleges it is  a \u201cthreatening letter\u201d via Defendant Ctemple, Clerk, an agent of \nthe Justice of the Peace Court.  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 43). \n4 Plaintiff appeared before J.P.  Peterson on July 23, 2021.  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 49).   He alleges \nthat J.P. Peterson berated him and then arrested and unlawfully detained him until \nPlaintiff satisfied bail.  (Id.  at \u00b6 50).  \n5 This is a new traffic case.  \n6 Plaintiff was detained by Officer Zeilman.  It a ppears that Plaintiff appeared before J.P. \nPerez -Chambers via Zoom.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 57, 58, 59).  Zoom Video Communications, Inc. \nand its CEO are named defendants.  4 \n June 27, 2022.  Plaintiff is summoned to appear at the Court of Common \nPleas  Traffic Court for arraignment and trial on July 26, 2022, in Case  No. \n2002015749, Complaint 322019259, Arrest Number T322003375.   (Id. at \nEx. X).   \nJuly 12, 2022.   Plaintiff is informed by the DOT that it is not in possession \nof any of the documents Plaintiff  sought  from Director Simpler  and \nSecretary  Majeski .  (Id. at Ex. V).   \n  \n Plaintiff commenced this action on August 2, 2022.  (D.I. 2).   It contains  eleven \ncounts, as follows:   \nCount  I, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights \nagainst Harris, Peterson, Ctemple, Zeilman, Perez -Chambers, New Castle \nCounty Court of Common Pleas Judge Katherine Mayer, Lemieux, N ew \nCastle County Police , Justice of the Peace Court 11, N ew Castle County , \nUniversity of Delawa re, Zoom, DOT, DMV, and the State of Delaware, \nindividually and in concert . \n \nCount II , assault against Harris and Zeilman , individually . \n Count III , battery against Harris and Zeilman, individually . \n Count IV , false imprisonment against Harris, Peterson, Ctemple, Zeilman, \nPerez -Chambers, Zoom, Mayer, Lemieux, individually and in concert . \n Count V , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for maintaining custom s and policies that \nviolated Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional righ ts against New Castle County, New \nCastle County Police Department, New Castle County Justice of the Peace Court No. 11, New Castle Court of Common Pleas, and the \nUniversity of Delaware Police Department . \n Count VI , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for maintaining custom s and policies that \nviolated Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights against the University of Delaware and the University of Delaware Police Department . \n Count VII , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for failure to inadequately supervise and train \ntheir employees against the Stat e of Delaw are, Department of Motor \nVehicles, and Delaw are Department of Transportation.  \n Count VIII , for failure to inadequately supervise and train it s employees \nagainst  Zoom Video Communications, Inc.  \n 5 \n Count IX , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 under a theory of r espondeat  superior for \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, and commercial harassment against \nState of Delaware.  \n Count X,  civil rights for failure to respond to Plaint iff\u2019s filings/letters  against \nHarris, Peterson, Ctemple, Zeilman, Perez -Chambers, Mayer, and \nLemi eux. \n Count XI , civil rights for failure to  produce oaths and bonds of public office \nagainst  Harris, Peterson, Ctemple, Zeilman, Perez -Chambers, Mayer, \nLemi eux, Davis, Danberg, Bloch, Ogden, Meyers, Majeski, Simpler, and \nCarney.  \n \n There is no prayer for relief  although t he body of the C omplaint states that this is \nan \u201cact ion for money damages, declaratory and injunctive relief.\u201d  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 4).   \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, h is \npleading is liberally construed and his  Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only 6 \n where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .    \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend his  complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview Stat e Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007) .  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id . at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not ent itled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 7 \n 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that  requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n Immunity .  Most D efendants are immune from suit.   Judge Mayer,  Justice of the \nPeace Peterson, and Justice of the Peace Perez -Chambers have judicial immuni ty.  \u201cA \njudicial officer in the performance of his duties has absolute immunity from suit and will not be liable for his judicial acts. \u201d  Capogrosso v. The Supreme Court of New Jersey , \n588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Azubuko v. Royal, 443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir. 2006)).    \n The allegations against the foregoing Defendants  relate to actions they took as \njudges.   For example, Plaintiff  takes exception to J.P. Peterson\u2019s demeanor when he \nappeared before him (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 51) ; Plaintiff  appeared before J.P. Perez -Chambers  via \nZoom and complains that she failed to si gn a bond/order to appear ( id. at 57, 58) ; and, \nhe alleges that Judge Mayer issued a warrant for Plai ntiff\u2019s arrest ( id. at \u00b6 66) .  The \nComplaint does not set forth any facts t o show that any of the foregoing judges acted in \nthe absence of jurisdiction.   They will be dismissed.    \n Clerk of Courts Ctemple and Lemi eux are immune from suit.   Plaintiff alleges that \nJustice of the Peace Court  Clerk  Ctemple  sent him a threatening letter to appear in the \nJustice of the Peace Court No. 11 on October 12, 2020.  (D.I. 2 at 15).   The letter is a \nnotice to appear at a  scheduled \u201cmotion to dismiss w/trial.\u201d   (See D.I. 2 at Ex. E).   At \nsome point, Case No. 200215749 was transferred from the Justice of the Peace Court 8 \n to the Court of Common Pleas.  The Complaint alleges that Lemi eux is the  Clerk \u201cfor the \nnewly issued warrant.\u201d  ( See D.I. 2  at \u00b6 66 and Ex. X).    \n Under certain circumstances , a clerk of court may be entitled to judicial immunity.  \n\u201cWhen judicial immunity is extended to officials other than judges, it is because their \njudgments are functionally comparable to those of judges \u2014that is, because they, too, \nexercise a discretionary j udgment as a part of their function. \u201d  Antoine v. Byers & \nAnderson, Inc.,  508 U.S. 429, 436 (1993) ( cleaned up); Tucker v. Doe, 173 F. App\u2019 x 969 \n(3d Cir. 2006) ; Rodriguez v. Weprin, 116 F.3d 62, 66 (2d Cir. 1997) (a clerk may not be \nentitled to absolute im munity in all cases, but holding that the clerk was immune from \nliability for allegedly failing to properly manage the court calendar).    \n The acts as alleged are comparable to those of judges ( i.e., sending notices, \nissuing warrants).  As such, Ctemple and Lemieux  are immune from suit  and will be  \ndismissed as defendants.      \n The State of Delaware, J ustice of the Peace Court  11, the Court of Common \nPleas, the DMV, the DOT,  as well as individuals Governor Carney, DOT Secretary \nMajeski, DMV Director Simpler , Chief Magistrate Davis, Chief Judge Danberg, and \nDeputy A.G. Roop, all of whom are sued only their official capacities , have E leventh \nAmendment immunity.   The Eleventh Amendment of the United St ates Constitution \nprotects an unconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by \none of its own citizens, regardless of the relief sought.  See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. \nFlorida, 517 U.S. 44, 54  (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp.  v. Halderman, 465 U.S. \n89 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974).   In addition, \u201ca suit against a state \nofficial in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit 9 \n against the official \u2019s office.  As such, it is no different from a suit against the State itself. \u201d  \nWill v. Michigan Dep't of State Police , 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal citation omitted); \nAli v Howard , 353 F. App= x 667, 672 (3d Cir. 2009).   Therefore, \u00a7  1983 claims for \nmonetary damages against a s tate, state agency, or a state official in his or her official \ncapacity are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  See id.   The State  Defendants have \nEleventh Amendment immunity.  The Defendants either fall under the umbrella of the \nState of Delaware or they are individuals who are sued in their official capacities , which \nare suits against their official offices.  Therefore,  all claims against State Defendants , all \nimmune State Defendants, and Counts VII and IX raised against immune State \nDefendants will be dismissed.  Amendment is futile as to Counts VII and IX.  \n As discussed , Chief Judge Danberg, Judge Mayer, Chief Magistrate Davis, J.P. \nPeterson, J.P. Perez -Chambers , the State of Delaware, Justice of the Peace Court 11, \nthe Court of Common Pleas,  Ctemple, Lemieux,  the DMV, the DOT, Governor Carney, \nDOT Secretary Majeski, DMV Director Simpler, and Deputy A.G. Roop and the claims \nraised against them are dismissed based upon immunity from suit. 6F7  Amendment is \nfutile as to claims against the foregoing immune defendants.  \n \n7 The Complaint alleges that all Defendants listed herein are liable under the theory of \nrespondeat superior including, but not limited to Deputy A.G. Roop, Governor Carney,  \nDOT Secretary Majeski, DMV Director Simpler, Judge Mayer , Chief Magistrate Davis , \nChief of Police B loch, Chief Judge Danberg, P resident Assanis, Chief of Police Ogden,  \nand CEO Yuan.  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 8).  There is no respondeat superior liability under \u00a7 1983. \nSee Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016).  A defendant in a civil rights \naction \u201ccannot be held responsible for a constitutional violation which he [ ] neither \nparticipated in nor approved. \u201d Baraka v. McGreevey , 481 F.3d 187, 210 (3d Cir. 2007); \nsee also Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325, (1981) (holding that liability in a \u00a7 1983 action must be based on personal involvement, not respondeat super ior).   10 \n  Statute of Limitation s.  The March 2020 claims , which concerns actions taken \nby Harris when he arrested Plaintiff , are time -barred.   For purposes of the statute of \nlimitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as personal injury actions.  Wilson v. \nGarcia , 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985).  In Delaware, \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two- year \nlimitations period.  See  10 Del. C. \u00a7  8119; Johnson v. Cullen, 925 F.  Supp. 244, 248 (D. \nDel. 1996) .  Section 1983 claims accrue \u201c when the plaintiff knew or should have known \nof the injury upon which its action is based. \u201d  Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 \nF.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).  \n The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that  generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised.  See Benak ex rel. Alliance Premier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P ., 435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, 807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201cAlthough \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual record is required to be developed.\u2019\u201d Davis v. Gauby , 408 F. App\u2019 x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010)  (quoting Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)).  Accordingly a \ncourt may dismiss a time -barred c laim sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \n Plaintiff  complains of acts by Harris that occurred in March 2020.  He did not file \nhis Complaint until August 2, 2022.   Hence, it is evident from the face of the Complaint that the March 2020 claims raised against Harris are barred by the two- year limitations \nperiod and they will be dismissed.  \n Count I .  Count I is raised pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, is  brought against \nfifteen defendants , and alleges violations of Plaintiff \u2019s constitutional rights.   As 11 \n discussed above, several Defendants will be dismissed.  The claims against Harris are \ntime-barred and Peterson, Ctemple, Perez -Chambers, Mayer, Lemiuex, Justice of the \nPeace Court No. 11, the DOT, the DMV and the State of Delaware are immune from suit. \n To prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must show that a person (or persons), \nacting under color of law, deprived him of a constitutional right.  Parratt v. Taylor , 451 \nU.S. 527, 535 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams , 474 U.S. 327 \n(1986) ; Thomas v. Tice, 948  F.3d 133, 1 38 (3d Cir. 2020) .  While  the body of the \nComplaint alleges vio lations of the Articles of the Constitution and the Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, there is no mention of Articles or Amendment in Count I .  As pled, the Court cannot  discern  under \nwhich Article or Amendment (if any) Plaintiff proceeds.   \n In addition, New Castle County Police Department, New Castle County, and the \nUniversity of Delaware are named defendants.  However, as discussed below, to state claims against these entities Plaintiff must plead Monell  claims  \u2013 the claims  raise d in \nCounts V and VI , which  are discussed below.   Count I also names Zoom, which  is not a \nstate actor.  As discussed below, the claims against Zoom and its president will be dismissed.  That leav es Officer Zeilman as the sole defendant in Count I.   Count I does \nnot refer to a constitutional article or amendment.  It fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and will be dismissed.  Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the \nclaims raised in Count I against Officer Zeilman.    \n State Claims, Counts II, III, and IV .  Count s II, III, and IV are brought against  \nOfficers Harris and Zeilman for assault, battery , and against Harris, Peterson, Ctemple, 12 \n Zeilman, Peter -Chambers, Zoom, Mayer,  and Lemiuex for unlawful imprisonment  (i.e., \nfalse imprisonment) . 7F8  \n To state a claim for assault , Plaintiff must allege that Zeilman (1) acted \nintentionally, (2) without Plaintiff\u2019s  consent and (3) the actions of Zeilman placed Plain tiff \nin fear of imminent harmful or offensive contact.  Smith v. Access Lab. Servs., Inc ., 2022 \nWL 1538029, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. May 16, 2022) .  To recover for this tort, there need \nnot have been contact between the parties.   As pled, the assault claim fails to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted.  There are no allegations that the actions of \nZeilman placed Plaintiff in fear o f imminent harmful or offensive contact.  Count II will be \ndismissed.  Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count II against Zeilman.   \n Count III alleges battery by Zeilman.  \u201cThe tort of battery is \u2018the intentional, \nunpermitted contact upon the person of another which is harmful or offensive.\u2019\u201d Hunt ex \nrel. DeSombre v. State of Delaware, 69 A.3d 360, 368 (Del. Super . Ct. 2013) . Under 11 \nDel. Code \u00a7 467, the use of force is justifiable when the defendant is \u201cmaking an arrest or assisting in making an arrest and believes that such force is immediately necessary to effect the arrest.\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7 467(a)(1).  There are no allegations of intentional unpermitted contact by Zeilman. Count III will be dismissed.  Plaintiff will be given leave \nto amend Count I II against Zeilman.    \n Count IV alleges false  imprisonment by Zeilman and Zoom , all other defendants \nhaving been dismissed.  False impris onment  is defined as t he unlawful restraint of \nanother without  consent and without legal justification.  See Hunt v. State, 69 A.3d 360, \n \n8 As previously noted, t he claims against Harris are time- barred.  Peterson, C temple , \nLemieux , Perez -Chambers, Mayer, and Lemieux are immune from suit . 13 \n 368 (Del.  2013).  A claim for false imprisonment  arises when a person is arrested \nwithout probable cause and is subsequently detained pursuant to that unlawful arrest. \nSee Adams v. Selhorst , 449 F. App\u2019 x 198, 201 (3d Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (citing \nGroman v. Township of Manalapan, 47 F.3d 628, 636 (3d Cir. 1995).   Hence, a claim of \nfalse imprisonment derives from and depends on an arrest without probable cause.  See Johnson v. Camden Cty. Prosecutors\u2019 Office, 2012 WL 273887, at 4 n.2 (D.N.J. Jan. 31, 2012) (stating that a false imprisonment claim under \u00a7 1983 is based on t he \nFourteenth Amendment protection against deprivations of liberty without due process of law but that the claim is derivative of a Fourth Amendment claim for arrest without probable cause) (citing Baker v. McCollan , 443 U.S. 137, 142 (1979); Groman , 47 F. 3d \nat 636).  \n \u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when the facts and the circumstances within the \narresting officer's knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a reasonable \nperson to believe that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be \narrested.\u201d   Merkle v. Upper Dublin Sch. Dist ., 211 F.3d 782, 788 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting \nOrsatti v. New Jersey State Police , 71 F.3d 480, 482 (3d Cir. 1995));  see also Minatee \nv. Philadelphia Police Dep \u2019t, 502 F. App'x 225, 228 (3d Cir. 2012) (citati on omitted). The \narresting officer must reasonably believe at the time of the arrest that an offense is being committed, a significantly lower burden than proving guilt at trial.  See Wright v. \nCity of Phil adelphia, 409 F.3d 595, 602 (3d Cir. 2005); see al so Minatee, 502 F. App\u2019 x \nat 228 (citation omitted).  \n As alleged, Plaintiff \u201cwas surreptitiously arrested\u201d by Zeilman at the University of \nDelaware , where he was employed,  \u201cunder false and misleading pretenses of being a 14 \n \u2018private matter\u2019 via his employer\u2019s orders to go to the University Polic e Station.\u201d  (D.I. 2 \nat \u00b6 55).   Plain tiff alleges th at he signed a \u201cwaiver of rights to replacement of  venue\u201d  \nunder duress,  and that he appeared vi a Zoom before J.P. Perez -Chambers on the date \nof his arrest, June 7, 2022.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56, 57).   During the Zoom appearance,  \nPlaintiff was given a \u201c bond/order to appear \u201d for an arraignment on the charges of driving \nwith a suspended/revoked license and inattentive driving.  ( Id. at \u00b6 58 and Ex. P).   \nPlaintiff alleges that he signed the document \u201cunder duress .\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6 58).   Given the \nallegations  of inattentive driving and driving on a suspended or revoked license, Officer \nZeilman could  have reasonably believed at the time of arrest that an offense was being \ncommitted  and that probable cause existed for the arrest. See Ferry v. Barry , 2012 WL \n4339454, at *5 (D.N.J. Sept.19, 2012) (\u201c[B]ecause Plaintiff is unable to demonstrate the \nabsence of probable cause, he fails to state a claim for false arrest and this claim must \nbe dismissed, along with his derivative claim for false imprisonment arising from the \ndetention pursuant to that arrest.\u201d) (citation omitted).  \n The Complaint does not allege that Zeilman arrested Plaintiff without probable \ncause and therefore does not allege that Zeilman violated Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment \nrights.   Nor or there any allegations that Zoom in any way unlawfully restrained Plaintiff.  \nAccordingly, Count IV will be d ismissed .  While it is unlikely that Plaintiff can state a \nfalse imprisonment claim, he will be given leave to amend against Officer Zeilman.  \n Count V  and Count VI .  Count V  alleges New Castle County, New Castle Police \nDepartment, and the University of Delaware d eveloped and maintained policies or \ncustoms such as \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cfraternity\u201d that exhibited deliberate indifference to the \nconstitutional rights of people and persons in New Castle County , which caused 15 \n violations of Plaintiff\u2019s rights.  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 79).   It alleges that New Castle County \ninadequately supervised and trained its police officers  and, in turn,  failed to adequately \ndiscourage constitutional violations on the part of its police officers.   (Id. at \u00b6 80).  The \nComplaint also alleges that as a result of the policies and customs, New Castle County \nand University of Delaware police believed their act ions would not be properly \nmonitored by supervisory officers.  ( Id. at \u00b6  81). \n Count VI alleges  the University of Delaware and the University of Delaware \nPolice Department have a policy and custom of  inadequately supervis ing and training \ntheir police officers and,  therefore, fail to adequately discourage further constitutional \nviolations on the part  of their police officers.  ( Id. at \u00b6 84).  \n The New Castle County Police Department falls under the umbrella of New \nCastle County. 8F9  As such, the claim is no different than  had it been raised against New \nCastle County .  See Batiste v. Lee, 2004 WL 2419130, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 14, \n2004) ( New Castle County Police Department is part of the municipality of New Castle  \nCounty , is a non- suable government entity , and may not be sued as a separate entity ).  \nThe same logic holds  true for the  Universit y of Delaware Police Department .  Its police \nofficer s are employed by the University of Delaware.  See  https://www1.udel.edu/  \n \n9 The Complaint  names NCC Chief of Police Bloch  and NCC Executive Meyer in their \nofficial capacitie s, and Officer Harris in his individual and individual capacities.  In \naddition, the Complaint names UD Chief of Pol ice Ogden and UD President Assanis in \ntheir official capacities, and Officer Zeilman in her individual and official capacities.  Any \nclaims against the individual NCC and UD D efendants in their official capacities will be \ndismissed because these claims are treated as claims against either New Castle \nCounty or the University of Delaware.  See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991); \nStacey v. City of Hermitage , 178 F. App\u2019x 94, 100 (3d Cir. 2006).  16 \n police/jobs/  (last visited Dec. 2, 2022) .  Therefore, the claims against both police \ndepartments will be dismissed.   \n The Court turns to the Monell  claims raised against New Castle County in Count \nV and the University of Delaware in Count VI.  With regard to New Castle County, w hile \na government policy is established by a \u201c decisionmaker possessing final authority, \u201d a \ncustom arises from a \u201c course of conduct. . . so permanent and well settled as to virtually \nconstitute law. \u201d  Andrews , 895 F.2d at 1480 (citing Monell v. Department  of Social \nServices of the City of New York , 436 U.S. 658 (1978)).  Accordingly, a plaintiff seeking \nto recover from a municipality must (1) identify an allegedly unconstitutional policy or \ncustom, (2) demonstrate that the municipality, through its deliberate and culpable conduct, was the \u201c moving force\u201d  behind the injury alleged; and (3) demonstrate a dir ect \ncausal link between the municipal action and the alleged deprivation of federal rights. Board of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).  \n With regard to the University of Delaware, Courts have determined that  it is a \nstate actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983.   See Stiner v. The University of Delaware, 2004 WL \n1949545, at * 6 (D. Del. Aug. 27, 2004).   For an institution to be liable under \u00a7 1983, a \nplaintiff must demonstrate that an institutional policy or custom caused the alleged constitutional violation.  See Bowers v. University of Delaware, 2020 WL 7025090, at *3 (D. Del. Nov. 30, 2020).   Plaintiff  has not pled any theory of institutional liability. See \nNatale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility , 318 F.3d 575, 583- 84 (3d Cir. 2003).      \n Neither Count alleges a causal link between the actions or policies of New Castle \nCounty and the University of Delawar e and a constitutional violation.  Instead, they both \nallege in a conclusory manner violations of constitutional rights without identifying those 17 \n rights.  In turn, both counts do not plead that either defendant was the \u201c moving force\u201d  \nbehind any alleged uni dentified constitutional violation.   \n Counts V and VI fail to state claims upon which relief can be granted.  Therefore, \nthe counts will be dismissed and Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the claims \nagainst New Castle County and the University of Del aware.  \n Count VIII .  Zoom and Zoom CEO Yuan are named defendants.   There are no \nallegations that either are state actors.  To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a \nplaintiff must allege \u201c the violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person \nacting under color of state law. \u201d  West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (citing Parratt v. \nTaylor , 451 U.S. at  535, overruled in part on other grounds by Daniels v. Wi lliams , 474 \nU.S. at 330-31). To act under \u201c color of state law \u201d a defendant must be \u201c clothed with the \nauthority of state law. \u201d  West , 487 U.S. at 49.    \n The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff appeared before J.P.  Perez -Chambers  via \nZoom .  There are no allegat ions directed towards Yuan.  Even liberally construing the \nComplaint, it is evident that neither D efendant is \u201cclothed with the authority of state law. \u201d  \nSee Reichley v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019 t of Agric ., 427 F.3d 236, 244- 45 (3d Cir. 2005); \nBiener v. Calio , 361 F.3d 206, 216- 17 (3d. Cir. 2004).   Therefore, Count VIII will be \ndismissed.  Amendment is futile as to Count VIII.  \n Count X  and Count XI .  Count X alleges violations of Plaintiff\u2019s civil rights when  \nOfficer Harris, J.P.  Peterson, Ctemple, Officer Zeilman , J.P. Perez -Chambers, Judge \nMayer, and Lemieux  did not respond to Plaintiff\u2019s letters and courtesy copy of \ndocuments he filed.  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64, 91, 92).  Count XI alleges 18 \n that Officer Harris, J. P. Peterson, Ctemple, Officer Zeilman, J.P. Perez -Chambers, \nJudge Mayer, Lemieux , Chief Magistrate Davis, Chief Judge Danberg, Police Chief \nBloch, Police Chief Ogden, Executive Meyer, Secretary Majeski, Director Simpler, and \nGovernor Carney did not respond to Plaintiff\u2019s demands for oaths and bonds.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 \n93, 94).   No constitutional rights are implicated in Defendants\u2019 failure to respond to \nPlaintiff\u2019s letters, service copies, and demands for oaths and bonds .  Counts X and XI \ndo not state cognizable c laims and they will be dismissed. 9F10  Amendment is futile as to \nCounts X and XI.   \n Prayer for Relief .  The Complaint does not contain a prayer for relief that  \nexplains what relief P laintiff seeks .  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)  and (3) \nrequire that a complaint contain \u201c a short and plain statement of the claim showing that \nthe pleader is entitled to relief, \u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and \u201c a demand for the relief, \u201d \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(3).   See , e.g., Scibelli v. Lebanon Cnty ., 219 F. App\u2019 x 221, 222 (3d \nCir. 2007).  See also Klein v. Pike Cnty. Comm \u2019rs, 2011 WL 6097734 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 6, \n2011) (failure to articulate a prayer for relief compels dismissal).  Plaintiff \u2019s failure to \nspecify relief of any sort weighs in favor of dismissal  for noncompliance with Rule 8.  \nSee Liggon -Redding v. Souser , 352 F. App\u2019 x 618, 619 (3d Cir. 2009) (affirming \ndismissal without prejudice where complaint failed to identify relief sought).  Because \nthe amended complaint does not contain a prayer for relief, it will be dismissed .  Plaintiff \nwill be given leave to amend.  \n  \n \n10 Many Defendants in Counts X and XI are immune from  suit.  See  infra at 7-9. 19 \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will : (1) deny as premature Plaintiff\u2019s motions \nfor leave to issue service of summons (D.I. 5, 6); (2)  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i), (ii), and (iii) ; (3) allow Plaintiff to amend Counts I, II, III, and \nIV against Officer Zeilman, Count V against New Castle County, and Count VI against \nUniversity of Delaware ; and dismiss with prejudice all defendants except Zeilman, New \nCastle County, and the University of Delaware.  Amendment is futile  as to Counts VII, \nVIII, IX, X, and XI.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.  "}
