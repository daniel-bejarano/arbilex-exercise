{"case_name": "Peloton Interactive, Inc. vs iFIT Inc.", "case_number": "20-1535", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "05-13-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \niFIT INC., \nDefendant . Civil Action No. 20-1535-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nBefore me is iFIT's Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.I. 145). I have reviewed the \nparties' briefing. (D.I. 148, 167, 172, 183-1, 183-2). For the reasons that follow, I will grant \nthis motion and dismiss the other pending motions as moot. \nI. BACKGROUND \nWhile working as a freelance prop man on a Peloton commercial shoot, Jeff Barber was \ngiven 34 pages of documents outlining the dialogue for two Peloton television commercials and \nthe creative content for a companion digital advertising campaign (the \"Scripts\"). (D.I. 9-1, Ex. \n2; see D.I. 148 at 1; D.I. 167 at 1). Mr. Barber had signed multiple NDAs and understood that \nthe Scripts were confidential. (See D.I. 168-1, Ex. 1 at 17:3-18; Ex. 17). On October 25, \n2020, Mr. Barber emailed a copy of the Scripts to his childhood friend, Kelley Chambers , who \nworked as a mechanic at iFIT, Peloton's competitor . (See D.I. 9-1, Ex. 2 at 1). \nEight days later, on November 2, 2020, iFIT produced the email and the Scripts to \nPeloton in a document production for a separate dispute between the parties. (D.I. 25 at ,r,r 8-\n11). Approximately seven days later, Peloton discovered this email in the document \n1 production. (D.I. 11 at ,r,r 2-3; D.I. 25-1, Ex. A). Peloton then filed the present suit on \nNovember 16, 2020, alleging that iFIT violated the Defend Trade Secrets Act (\"DTSA\"), 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1836. (D.I. 2). Peloton defines its trade secret as the overall content of the \nadvertising campaign reflected in the Scripts. (D.I. 167 at 19). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" FED. \nR. Crv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. \nLamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242,248 (1986)). \"[A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence \nis sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. The \nburden on the moving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is \nan absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 \nU.S. 317,323 (1986). \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); \nWilliams v. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving \nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions , documents , electronically stored \ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations ... , admissions , interrogatory answers, or \nother materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish \nthe absence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" FED. R. Crv. P. 5 6( c )( 1). The non-moving party's \n2 evidence \"must amount to more than a scintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the \ncourt) than a preponderance. \" Williams, 891 F.2d at 460-61. \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable \ninferences in that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the \nnon-moving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with \nrespect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \noflaw. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nTo establish a violation of the DTSA, Peloton must prove: \"(l) the existence of a trade \nsecret, defined generally as information with independent economic value that the owner has \ntaken reasonable measures to keep secret; (2) that is related to a product or service used in, or \nintended for use in, interstate or foreign commerce , and (3) the misappropriation of that trade \nsecret(.]\" Oakwood Lab ys LLC v. Thanoo, 999 F.3d 892, 905 (3d Cir. 2021) (internal citations \nand quotations omitted). iFIT moves for summary judgment on Peloton's DTSA claim because \nPeloton has failed to show that iFIT misappropriated its trade secret. The DTSA defines \n\"misappropriation \" as: \"(A) acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or \nhas reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (B) disclosure or \nuse of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent\" in certain circumstances . \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839(5). Peloton argues that iFIT misappropriated its trade secret through both \nacquisition and use. \n3 A. Acquisition of the Trade Secret by Improper Means \nPeloton argues that iFIT misappropriated its trade secret by using improper means to \nacquire it. Under the DTSA, \"improper means\" includes \"breach or inducement of a breach of \na duty to maintain secrecy.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839(6)(A). During a telephone conversation, Mr. \nBarber told Mr. Chambers that he was working on a production for Peloton and had a copy of the \nScripts. (D.I. 168-1, Ex. 3 at 60:2-61 :22). Mr. Chambers testified that he jokingly told Mr. \nBarber, \"Send that to me. That would be fun to read.\" (Id. at 64:25-65:2 ). When Mr. Barber \nresponded , \"No I can't do that,\" Mr. Chambers kept \"ribbing\" with his friend, stating, \"Well, \ncome on. It would be a great read for me.\" (Id. at 70:4-17). After the call, Mr. Barber \nemailed Mr. Chambers a copy of the Scripts, writing in the body of the email, \"Dont [sic] \nforward or show my name.\" (D.I. 149-1, Ex. 1). \niFIT argues that Peloton cannot show that Mr. Chambers used improper means to acquire \nthe Scripts because he was merely joking with a childhood friend. (D.I. 148 at 19). I disagree. \nThis evidence is sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether Mr. Chambers induced Mr. \nBarber to breach his duty of secrecy and send him the Scripts. Mr. Chambers appeared to know \nthat these scripts were confidential but continued to ask his friend to send him a copy. \niFIT argues that, in any event, Mr. Chambers ' improper acquisition of the Scripts cannot \nbe imputed to iFIT under the doctrine ofrespondeat superior. (Id.). Peloton's only response is \nthat the doctrine of respondeat superior does apply here because ''the evidence shows that Mr. \nChambers was motivated by a desire to serve iFIT' s interests in discovering everything he could \nabout Peloton's marketing activities. \" (D.I. 167 at 21). \n4 Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, 1 an employer is only liable for an employee 's \ntorts committed within the scope of his employment. Hecksher v. Fairwinds Baptist Church, \nInc., 115 A.3d 1187, 1200 (Del. 2015). To determine whether an employee 's conduct is within \nthe scope of employment, Delaware courts look to the factors set out in the Restatement \n(Second) of Agency. Id. Section 228 of the Restatement provides that an employee's act falls \nwithin the scope of his employment if: \"(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform; (b) it \noccurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits; [ and] ( c) it is actuated, at least \nin part, by a purpose to serve the [employer]. \" Restatement (Second) of Agency\u00a7 228. \nMr. Chambers' acquisition of the Scripts was clearly outside the scope of his employment \nwith iFIT. He was the \"director of samples in [iFIT's] machine and fabrication shops.\" (D.I. \n28 at ,r,r 2-3). In this role, he was the mechanic in charge of painting, welding, and assembling \nproduct samples; he was not in the marketing department. (Id.). Discovering the advertising \nplans of iFIT' s competitor was not included in his job duties. Mr. Chambers ' actions have no \nconceivable relationship to his actual duties at iFIT. Further, Peloton has provided no evidence \nthat anyone at iFIT asked Mr. Chambers to obtain Peloton information or that Mr. Chambers was \nmotivated by iFIT's interests to discover Peloton's confidential marketing activities. Mr. \nChambers did give a copy of the Scripts to his supervisor , Jared Willardson , but there is no \n1 Both parties proceed on the assumption that an employer can be held vicariously liable for its \nemployee 's misappropriation under the DTSA. While the Third Circuit has not yet addressed \nthis issue, many federal district courts have held that the DTSA allows for respondeat superior \nliability. See, e.g., Navigation Holdings , LLC v. Molavi, 2020 WL 5074307, at *3 (N.D. Cal. \nAug. 25, 2020); Inventus Power, Inc. v. Shenzhen Ace Battery Co., 2020 WL 3960451, at* 11 \n(N.D. Ill. July 13, 2020); Brain Inj. Ass 'n of Cal. v. Yari, 2020 WL 3643482, at *6 (C.D. Cal. \nApr. 30, 2020); Bombardier Inc. v. Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp., 383 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1188 (W.D. \nWash. 2019). \n5 evidence that Mr. Willardson instructed Mr. Chambers to acquire the Scripts or that he even had \nthe authority to do so. Thus, the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply here. I will \ntherefore grant summary judgment on Peloton's theory of misappropriation based on improper \nacquisition. \nB. Use of the Trade Secret \nPeloton argues that iFIT misappropriated its trade secret by using the trade secret to \ninform iFIT's marketing strategy. \"[T]he 'use' of a trade secret encompasses all the ways one \ncan take advantage of trade secret information to obtain an economic benefit, competitive \nadvantage, or other commercial value, or to accomplish a similar exploitative purpose[.]\" \nOakwood , 999 F.3d at 910. \nPeloton points to several pieces of circumstantial evidence to show that iFIT used the \nScripts. For example, several iFIT witnesses testified that iFIT made unidentified changes to its \ncommercials during November and December 2020, after iFIT received the Scripts. (D.I. 168-\n2, Ex. 40 at 134:18-135:5 ; Ex. 45 at 75:6--76:3; Ex. 46 at 75:19-76:2). Additionally, on \nNovember 4, 2020-ten days after Mr. Chambers received the Scripts-iFIT scheduled a call \nwith advertising agency MerchantCantos to discuss an advertising campaign for iFIT's ProForm \nbrand. (Id, Ex. 49). MerchantCantos \"agreed to a fast timeline to execute the creative.\" (Id, \nEx. 40 at 143:5-11). These advertisements publicly aired on November 21, 2020, and January \n11,2021. (D.I.174). \n6 Peloton argues that iFIT's ProForm advertisements strongly resemble the Scripts, which \nshows that iFIT copied the Scripts.2 For example , iFIT's advertisements used actors that looked \nsimilar to the potential casting decisions reflected in the Scripts. (D.I. 167 at 2; D.I. 168-1, Ex. \n5 at 26, 29). Additionally , Peloton's Scripts describe an opening scene where, \"A father checks \non his sleeping baby in their nursery and then tip-toes towards the bike/walks by his sleeping kid \ntip toeing.\" (D.I. 168-1, Ex. 5 at 3). iFIT's January 2021 advertisement has a similar scene \nwhere a father comforts his baby in a nursery. \nPeloton does not provide any evidence that these minor similarities are attributable to \niFIT's use of Peloton's trade secret. Instead, there is nothing to suggest that the similarities are \nanything other than the sorts of coincidental similarities that one would expect from competitors \nmarketing similar products to similar target audiences. The actors used by iFIT resemble the \n\"stock\" actor types that have been used many times by both iFIT and Peloton. (See D.I. 173-1, \nEx. 44; D.I. 174-1, Exs. A-B). Further, the idea of having a father and his baby in a fitness \nequipment advertisement is not something that iFIT needed Peloton's Scripts to conceive of or to \nreplicate. Without more, these \"similarities \" are insufficient to show misappropriation. See, \ne.g., Stratienko v. Cordis Corp., 429 F.3d 592, 601-02 (6th Cir. 2005) (reviewing a grant of \nsummary judgment and holding that plaintiff's evidence regarding the similarities between \nplaintiff's and defendant's catheters was insufficient to support a finding of \"use\" because \nplaintiff \"fail[ ed] to identify which, if any, innovative features his and [defendant 's] designs \n2 iFIT asks this Court to bar Peloton from presenting this \"copied content\" theory because it was \nnot timely disclosed. (D.I. 172 at 2-5). While I do think it is likely that Peloton did not timely \ndisclose this theory, I need not decide this issue. Even considering this \"copied content,\" \nPeloton has failed to provide prima facie evidence that iFIT used its trade secret. \n7 share\"); LiiON, LLC v. Vertiv Grp. Corp., 2021 WL 4963610, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 26, 2021) \n(granting summary judgment of no trade secret misappropriation because plaintiff failed to \nprovide any evidence that the similar features between plaintiff's and defendant 's products \"are \nactually attributable to [the defendant's] use of [the plaintiffs] alleged trade secrets\"). \nPeloton also argues that iFIT \"dramatically \" increased its advertising spend after it \nacquired Peloton's trade secret. (D.I. 167 at 13-15). Specifically , iFIT spent $37.6 million \nover its projected marketing spend for January/February 2021. (See D.I. 168-2, Ex. 51 at 7, 9, \n43). Peloton argues that based on iFIT's increase in its advertising spend and iFIT's \ncontradictory explanations for this increase, a reasonable juror could infer that iFIT used the \nScripts to inform its advertising spend. (D.I. 167 at 24). I disagree. Peloton's advertising \nspend theory is entirely speculative. The only \"evidence \" connecting this spending increase to \nPeloton's trade secret is the fact that iFIT received the Scripts two months earlier. But this \nattenuated connection is insufficient to show that iFIT used the Scripts. \nNot only is there nothing to connect the Scripts to increased advertising spending , there \nwere multiple reasons, based on undisputed facts, why iFIT increased its spending on \nadvertising. For example, there was a high demand for fitness equipment around New Year's \nand due to COVID, leading to increased sales. (See, e.g., D.I. 149-1, Ex. 10, Schedule 2.7; D.I. \n150, Ex. 27 at 65:21-66:8 ; Ex. 28 at 84:23-86:5 ; Ex. 30 at 90:17-91:11). Further, in October \n2020, iFIT received an investment of $200 million from the private equity firm L Catterton. \n(See D.I. 150, Ex. 30 at 35:6-37:24; Ex. 32 at 163:10-22 , 165:10-23). These reasons, \n8 combined with typical competition and market conditions, all contributed to iFIT' s increased \nadvertising spending. 3 \nFurther, iFIT's advertising spend in November and December 2020-right after it \nreceived,the Scripts-roughly tracked its projections. (D.I. 168-2, Ex. 51 at 5, 7, 43). If iFIT \nused the Scripts to inform its strategy for its New Year's campaign and the \"copied\" ProForm \nadvertisements , it is unclear why its advertising spend did not \"dramatically\" increase until \nJanuary and February 2021 (after Peloton publicly launched its New Year's campaign and \nextinguished most, if not all, of its trade secret). \nThus, I conclude that, based on this record, no reasonable juror could infer that iFIT' s \nincreased advertising spend was a result of iFIT using Peloton' s trade secret. \nPeloton points to \"plus factors\" to further support its circumstantial evidence of use. For \nexample, Peloton argues that iFIT's monitoring of Peloton's public marketing activities shows \nthat it had motive to discover Peloton's secret marketing plans. (D.I. 167 at 24-25). But the \nlawful monitoring of a competitor 's marketing activities-which is commonplace in the \n3 Peloton claims that iFIT' s witnesses have provided \"contradictory testimony\" explaining this \nincrease in advertising spending. (D.I. 167 at 14-15). For example, iFIT's Director of \nAdvertising, Douglas Stevenson, testified that the Catterton investment led to a $30 million \nincrease in iFIT's advertising spend (D.I. 168-2, Ex. 52 at 91:5-14), while iFIT's VP of \nMarketing , Joel Dewberry, testified that iFIT intended to invest \"an infusion of capital\" in \"a \n$100 million consumer advertising plan for ProForm.\" (Id., Ex. 40 at 150:3-151: 14; Ex. 56 at \n2). There is no real inconsistency between these statements. Testimony that the investment led \nto a $30 million increase in advertising spend over some undefined period of time is not \nnecessarily inconsistent with testimony that iFIT planned to invest in \"a $100 million advertising \nplan\" over another undefined period. Additionally , Peloton points out that iFIT' s VP of Paid \nMedia, Tyler Dixon, testified that he did not recall receiving any additional funds based on the \nCatterton investment. (Id., Ex. 53 at 28:12-23). The fact that one witness could not recall \nreceiving additional funds does not contradict the testimony of the several other witnesses who \ndid remember. These \"inconsistences\" do not create any genuine dispute regarding the reasons \nfor iFIT' s increased advertising spending. \n9 \"connected fitness\" industry (see D.I. 150-1, Ex. 24 at 68:17-24 ; Ex. 26 at 75:24-76:20 , 227:2-\n7)-and other lawful competition are not evidence of trade secret misappropriation. Pelo ton \nalso argues that iFIT' s failure to immediately notify Peloton of its acquisition of the Scripts \nsupports a finding of misappropriation. (D.I. 167 at 23-25). I disagree. There is no evidence \nthat iFIT actively concealed its acquisition of the Scripts from Peloton. iFIT produced to \nPeloton the evidence of its possession of Peloton's trade secret one week after it obtained the \ntrade secret, albeit without realizing it was doing so. Within another week, Peloton recognized \nthat iFIT had the trade secret. \nThroughout this litigation , iFIT has maintained a consistent story regarding what it did \nwith the Scripts. On October 26, 2020, after returning to the office, Mr. Chambers printed a \ncopy of the Scripts from his email. (D.I. 150, Ex. 39 at 104:18-21, 106:2-10). After reading a \nportion of the Scripts, Mr. Chambers brought the document to his immediate supervisor , Mr. \nWillardson , VP of Product Development. (Id. at 106:11-107:4). Mr. Willardson quickly \nflipped through the Scripts and told Mr. Chambers not to share the document with anyone. (Id., \nEx. 37 at 110: 17-111 :4, 114: 1-5). Mr. Willardson then put the Scripts in a sealed envelope and \ngave the envelope to iFIT's in-house counsel. (Id. at 121 :11-24, 125:15-24). Mr. Chambers \nand Mr. Willardson have both testified that they never disseminated the Scripts. (Id. at 134:5-\n135:8; Ex. 39 at 186:13-188:17). \nAfter iFIT produced _Mr. Barber's email in a separate document production , Peloton \ncontacted iFIT's outside counsel and requested that iFIT quarantine the email. (See D.I. 25-1, \nEx. A). On November 18, 2020, iFIT hired computer forensics expert Dr. Chuck Easttom to \nsearch iFIT's systems to ensure that the Scripts had not been disseminated. (D.I. 26 at ,r,r 3-6). \n10 Dr. Easttom deleted the Barber email and the Scripts and confirmed that the Scripts had not been \ndisseminated on iFIT's system. (Id. at ,r,r 19-21; D.I. 153-1, Exs. 13-14).4 Multiple iFIT \nwitnesses testified that they never saw the Scripts and did not use the Scripts. (See, e.g., D.I. \n150, Ex. 28 at 71:8-73:11; Ex. 31 at 142:23-144:9 ; Ex. 33 at 42:1-43:3; Ex. 36 at 105:12-\n106:7). \nPeloton has provided no evidence to support a finding that iFIT did anything with the \nScripts. Instead, Peloton's theory of misappropriation is based on speculation .5 Peloton's \nevidence-i.e ., the unremarkable similarities between iFIT's ProForm advertisements and \nPeloton's Scripts; iFIT's increased advertising spending ; iFIT's monitoring of Peloton's \nmarketing activities ; and iFIT' s failure to immediatel y notify Peloton of its acquisition of the \nScripts-is insufficient to show that iFIT used Peloton's trade secret. Thus, I will grant iFIT's \nmotion for summary judgment. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n4 Peloton moves to strike multiple paragraphs of Dr. Easttom's expert reports because iFIT has \nnot disclosed the data on which Dr. Easttom relied. (D.I. 146). Peloton states, however, \n\"Significant components of Dr. Easttom's opinions will remain-including his ultimate \nconclusions (however unfounded) that Mr. Chambers did not disseminate the Trade Secret-and \niFIT will be free to use those opinions to support its summary judgment motion.\" (D.I. 147 at \n18). Thus, I need not resolve Peloton's motion to strike in order to rely on Dr. Easttom's \nultimate opinion that the Scripts had not been disseminated. \n5 Perhaps even more speculative is Peloton's claim that it is entitled to damages equal to an \nunidentified percentage of $80 million. (See, e.g., D.I. 149-1, Ex. 10 at ,r 103 (damages expert \nreport) (\"Peloton incurred at least $80 million to implement the Trade Secrets (media spend for \nadvertising). If the trier of fact determines that a certain percentage of Peloton's spend in \nconnection with implementing the Trade Secrets has been diminished by iFIT' s \nmisappropriation , then a percentage may be applied against this $80 million spend to calculate \nPeloton's losses.\")). \n11 Entered this .{1_ day of May, 2022. \n12 "}
