No. 20 -1382- JLH \n      \n \nMEMORANDUM O RDER  \nPlaintiff Cynthia Jean Donelson appeals from a n unfavorable  decision of the Commissioner \nof the Social  Security  Administration1 denying her  application for disability  insurance benefits  \n(\u201cDIB\u201d) .  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).  The parties have consented to \nentry of final judgment by the United States Magistrate Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).   \nThe parties filed cross- motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 1 8, 24.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on October 29, 2021, the Court gra nts Plaintiff\u2019s motion and denies \nDefendant\u2019s motion.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence  \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014 \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d  Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019)  (quoting Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)) .  In reviewing \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kij akazi \nwas automatically substituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she succeeded him on July 9, 2021. 2 \n whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts  may not \u201cre -weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d  Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011) ; see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014) .  In other \nwords, r eviewing c ourts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner\u2019 s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis, and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail:  \nThe first two steps involve threshold determinations.  In step \none, the Commissioner must dete rmine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is \nfound to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claiman t has a medically severe impairment or \ncombination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissioner compares the medical \nevidence of the claim ant\u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work.  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrati ng \nan inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the \nclaimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical \nimpairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of 3 \n all the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is  capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n \nNewell v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545\u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks  disability insurance benefits or supplemental \nsecurit y income.  McCrea v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nThe decision of the Court was announced from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing \nas follows:  \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted  and the \nCommissioner\u2019s cross -motion for summary judgment is denied. \n \nPlaintiff argues that the ALJ erred at step four by failing to \naccount for the total limiting effects of Plaintiff\u2019 s cognitive and \nmenta l impairments and headaches when determining Plaintiff \u2019s \nresidual functional capacity  (RFC).   I agree that the case should be \nremanded for further consideration of the limiting effects of Plaintiff\u2019 s migraine headaches and whether her headaches, in \ncombina tion with her other impairments, require including \nlimitations in the RFC for absenteeism or time off- task. \n  The ALJ found that Plaintiff has a medically determinable \nimpairment of migraine headaches that could reasonably be expected to cause the symptoms  she alleged.  However, the ALJ \nfound that Plaintiff \u2019s testimony concerning the intensity, persistence \nand limiting effects of her symptoms were not consistent with the [medical ] evidence of record.\n2 \n Plaintiff\u2019 s alleged onset date of disability is April 1, 2014.  \nAs for the persistence of Plaintiff\u2019 s migraine headaches, the ALJ \npointed out that the record supports a finding that, more recently, their frequency has been reduced by 90% as a result of Plaintiff \u2019s \nongoing Botox treatments.  However, Plaintiff  was not receiving \nthose treatments during the entire alleged period of disability.  Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019 s testimony and the rest of the record suggests, \nand the ALJ appears to have found, that Plaintiff still experiences \n \n2 See 20 C .F.R. \u00a7 404.1529. 4 \n somewhere between three  and eight  headaches per month (and there \nis no substantial evidence otherwise) .3 \n \nThe ALJ stated that she took into account potential migraine \ntriggers in formulating the RFC, which limited Plaintiff to lights no brighter than a typical office setting level and noise no louder than a typical office level.  However, the record suggests that P laintiff\u2019 s \nmigraines are primarily triggered by the weather.\n4  And there is no \nsubstantial evidence that would support a finding that the noise and light restrictions adopted by the ALJ would prevent Plaintiff from having between three  and eight  migraine headaches per month.\n5 \n   As for the intensity and limiting effe cts of the headaches, \nPlaintiff testified that they last between a half and a whole day and that she has to l ie down in complete darkness with the windows \nclosed.\n6  The ALJ did not account for any absentee days or time off -\ntask in the RFC determination.  That suggests that the ALJ did not believe Plaintiff that she needed to lie down in the dark for between \na half and a full day when she had a migraine.  Of course, the ALJ \nwas not required to credit Plaintiff\u2019 s statements regarding the \nintensity and limiting effects of her symptoms.  However , the ALJ \ndid not sufficiently account for why they were not credited here.\n7 \n The ALJ pointed to evidence that the frequency of Plaintiff \u2019s \nmigraines had improved with Botox treatment.  But how often \nPlaintiff has migraines is a separate issue from what she can do when \nshe has them.   The Commissioner has pointed this Court to no \nmedical opinion specifically suggesting that Plaintiff does not  need \nto lie down in a dark room when she has a migraine (or any evidence \ngenerally suggesting that a person can perform light work while they \nare suffering from a migraine).  \n \n3 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 9\u201314 (Record or R.), at 24 (\u201c [A]s of June \n25, 2019, [ Plaintiff] was having only 3 migraines per month with Botox.\u201d) , 58\u201359, 61\u201362, 110, \n2216\u201317, 2227.)  \n \n4 (See R. at 58 \u201359, 61\u201362, 108\u201309, 2227.)  \n \n5 See Overcash v. Saul , No. 19- 737, 2020 WL 1083787, at *14 (D. Del. Mar. 6, 2020), \nadopted, 2020 WL 3893032 (D. Del. July 10, 2020) (remanding where \u201cthe ALJ fail[ed] to explain \nthe nexus, if any, between environmental limitations and migraine headaches\u201d).  \n \n6 (R. at 61\u201363, 110\u201311.)  \n \n7  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(2) , (3). \n 5 \n   \nThe Commissioner points out that the ALJ considered the \nfact that Plaintiff is able to take care of her children (one of whom is a teenager) with help from her parents and that Plaintiff recently took a two- week Disney vacation.\n8  But neither of those facts are \ninconsistent with Plaintiff suffering debilitating migraines between \nthree and eight times per month.   \n  \nThe Commissioner also suggested at argument that the ALJ \nmight have relied on the fact that Plaintiff has been prescribed migraine \u201crescue\u201d  medications that provide some relief from \nbreakthrough headaches.\n9  But it is not apparent from the ALJ \u2019s \ndecision that she actually relied on that fact.  The ALJ certainly did not make a n express finding that rescue medications would lessen \nPlaintiff\u2019s  migraine symptoms to such a degree that she could \ncontinue to perform light work and would not need to l ie down in a \ndark room for between a half and a full day.  And it is unclear to me \nthat there is substantial evidence in the record that would support such a finding.\n10 \n In sum, the determination that the RFC need not include \nlimitations for time off -task or absenteeism is not supported by \nsubstantial evidence articulated by the ALJ. The Commissioner \u2019s \ndecision is vacated and the matter is remanded back t o the \nCommissioner in accordance with  the fourth sentence of  42 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g)  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n  On remand, the Commissioner should give further \nconsideration to the evidence that Plaintiff is unable to perform light work when she is suffering from a migraine and explain the weight given to such evidence.  The Commissioner should also consider evidence that Plaintiff \u2019s limitations may have changed since her \nalleged disability onset date in 2014.   \n  \n \n8 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.1529(c)(3) (\u201cFactors relevant to your symptoms, such as pain, which \nwe will consider include: . . . (i) Your daily activities.\u201d).  \n \n9 See 20 C .F.R. \u00a7 414.1529(c)(3) ( \u201cFactors relevant to your symptoms, such as pain, which \nwe will consider include: . . . (iv) The type, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of any medication you take or have taken to alleviate your pain or other symptoms.\u201d ). \n \n10 (R. at 6 1\u201362, 2227.)  6 \n III. CONCLUSION \nPlaintif f\u2019s motion for summary judgment  (D.I. 1 8) is GRANTED and Defendant \u2019s motion \nfor summary judgment (D.I. 24) is DENIED . \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff, remand the action in \naccordance with sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and CLOSE the case. \n Dated: December  27, 2021   ______________________________ \n      The Honorable Jennifer L.
