Williams", "date": "12-02-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJONATHAN JOHNSON, ) \n) \nMovant/Defendant, ) \n) \n) \nV. ) \n) \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ) \n) \nRespondent/Plaintiff. ) Crim. Action No. 06-74-GBW \nMEMORANDUM \nOn May 16, 2007, Movant Jonathan Johnson pied guilty in this Court to \nbeing a prohibited person in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n922(g)(l) and\u00a7 924(a)(2). (D.I. 3; D.I. 32; D.I. 46-1 at 2) At the conclusion of the \nsentencing hearing on October 31, 2007, the Honorable Joseph J. Farnan sentenced \nMovant to sixty months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised \nrelease. The judgment was entered on December 4, 2007. (D.I. 38) Movant \nappealed, and the Third Circuit affirmed Movant' s judgment of conviction and \nsentence on December 31, 2008. (See D.I. 46-1) \nOn December 11, 2013, the United States Probation Office submitted a \npetition to this Court seeking revocation of Movant' s supervised release because \nMovant had tested positive for marijuana. (D.I. 51) At a hearing on January 9, 2014, the Honorable Leonard P. Stark found Movant in violation of the terms of \nhis supervised release. (D.I. 61) As a result, on January 10, 2014, an Amended \nJudgment was entered sentencing Movant to five months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by twelve additional months of supervised release. (D.I. 55) Movant \nappealed, and the Third Circuit affirmed Movant's sentence on September 17, \n2014. (See D.I. 62) \nOn March 4, 2015, the United States Probation Office submitted a petition to \nthis Court seeking revocation ofMovant 's supervised release because Movant had \ntested positive for marijuana and had also been arrested in Philadelphia for driving \nunder the influence of marijuana. (D.I. 63) A hearing for revocation of supervised \nrelease was held before Judge Stark on April 8, 2015. On April 13, 2015, an \nAmended Judgment was entered sentencing Movant to two months of \nimprisonment, with no further term of supervised release to follow. (D.I. 72) \nMovant did not appeal that sentence. \nSeven years later, on August 17, 2022, Movant filed a document titled \n\"Motion To File Out-Of-Time; Permission to File an Untimely Appeal of \nSuppress[ion] Denial.\" (D.I. 73) Subsequently , on September 13, 2022, Movant \nfiled a second document, titled \"Supplemental Demand Relief to Motion to File \nOut-of-Time Pursuant [to] Rule 4.5(b).\" (D.I. 74) Given the language in these \nfilings, the Court construed the documents to be an untimely motion to vacate, set \n2 aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. (D.I. 76; D.I. 77) The \nCourt also directed the Government and Movant' s former defense counsel to not \nrespond to Movant's Motion until ordered to do so by the Court. (D.I. 77 at 2) In \nresponse to the Court's Order to Show Cause why the construed\u00a7 2255 motion \nshould not be summarily dismissed, Movant explicitly stated that he was not \nseeking relief under \u00a7 225 5 but, instead, was asking for an extension of time to file \nan appeal from his 2007 conviction. (D.I. 78) Given Movant's explicit statement, \nthe Court reviewed the Motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure \nRule 4, and denied his request for an extension of time to file an appeal. (D.I. 81; \nD.I. 82) \nIn the interim, on October 7, 2022, Movant filed two separate documents \ntitled \"Notice of Declaratory Judgment.\" (D.I. 79; D.I. 80) In his \"Notice of \nDechtratory Judgment\" against the State of Delaware, Movant asks the State to \nprovide a statement concerning its \"legal authority\" to classify his \"non-violent\" \noffense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(l) as a \"violent\" offense for purposes of \nDelaware's habitual offender statute, and asserts that he will seek a default \njudgment and $10,000,000.01 in damages. (D.I. 79 at 3) After the State did not \nrespond to the Notice of Declaratory Judgment within Movant's time-frame, \n3 1Movant filed a document titled \"Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure\" (D.I. \n84 ), asserting that, if the State does not cure its failure to respond to his original \nNotice of Declaratory Judgment within ten days, he wants the Court to vacate his \nDelaware sentence and dismiss his indictment. (D.I. 84 at 1) \nIn his \"Notice of Declaratory Judgment \" against the United States, Movant \nasks the Government to provide proof that it was authorized to charge and/or indict \nhim with an offense that occurred within the State of Delaware 's jurisdiction, and \nasserts that he will seek a default judgment and possible dismissal of his federal \nindictment and conviction. (D.I. 80 at 3) After the Government did not respond to \nthe Notice of Declaratory Judgment, Movant filed a document titled \"Notice of \nFault and Opportunity to Cure\" (D.I. 83), asserting that, if the Government does \nnot cure its failure to respond to his original Notice of Declaratory Judgment \nwithin ten days, he wants the Court to vacate his federal sentence and dismiss his \nindictment. (D.I. 83 at 1) \nA. Movant's State Court Proceedings \nThe following background facts provide information relevant to the Court's \ncharacterization of Movant's instant requests for declaratory judgments: \n[In] September 2016, a grand jury indicted [Movant] on \nmultiple drug and weapons related charges. In April \n2017, [Movant] pleaded guilty [in the Delaware Superior \n1The Court notes that it did not order the State or the Government to respond to \nMovant's Notices. \n4 Court] to one count of drug dealing and one count of \npossession of a firearm during the commission of a \nfelony (\"PFDCF\"). The State moved to declare [Movant] \nto be a habitual offender under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214( d) and \nthat he be sentenced accordingly for the PFDCF offense. \nAfter a presentence investigation, the Superior Court \ngranted the habitual-offender motion and sentenced \n[Movant] as follows: for PFDCF, to twenty-five years \n[ of] incarceration ; and for drug dealing, to eight years \n[ of] incarceration, suspended for decreasing levels of \nsupervision. [Movant] did not file a direct appeal. \nJohnson v. State, 267 A.3d 370 (Table), 2021 WL 4699252, at *l. \n(Del. Oct. 7, 2021). In February 2019, Movant filed a motion for post-conviction \nrelief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\") \nchallenging his 2017 conviction. See State v. Johnson, 2020 WL 4746541, at *2 \n(Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 17, 2020). The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion, \nand the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on October 7, 2021. See \nJohnson, 2021 WL 4699252, at *2. Sometime thereafter, Movant filed a second \nRule 61 motion, which the Superior Court denied in March 2022. See Johnson v. \nState, 2022 WL 3695880, at* 1 (Del. Aug. 25, 2022). The Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed the denial ofMovant's second Rule 61 motion on August 25, 2022. \nSee id. \nB. Request for Declaratory Judgment Against State of Delaware \nIn his \"Notice of Declaratory Judgment\" against the State of Delaware , \nMovant asserts that the State erroneously classified his 2007 felon-in-possession \n5 conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) as a violent offense, which resulted in the \nSuperior Court erroneously declaring him an habitual offender in 2017 and \nerroneously enhancing his state sentence. (D.I. 79 at 3) For relief, he requests a \nstatement from the State of Delaware concerning its \"legal authority\" to classify \nhis \"non-violent\" offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(l) to a \"violent\" offense for \npurposes of Delaware's habitual offender statute, and asserts that he will seek a \ndefault judgment and $10,000,000.01 in damages twenty days after the State \nresponds to his request. (D.I. 79 at 3, 7-11) In his Notice of Fault and \nOpportunity to Cure, Movant reasserts his (1) request for $1,000,000 in damages; \nand (2) intent to have his Delaware sentence vacated and his indictment dismissed. \n(D.I. 84 at 1) \nTo the extent Movant's Notices challenge the Delaware Superior Court's \njurisdiction to declare him an habitual offender and seek the dismissal of his \nindictment and sentence, the Court concludes that the Notices are more \nappropriately treated as a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Therefore, \nthe Court will direct the Clerk to open a new civil case with the construed\u00a7 2254 \npetition as the initial filing. \nTo the extent Movant seeks ten million dollars in damages from the State of \nDelaware, Movant has not properly presented the request in the instant federal \ncriminal proceeding, nor can such a request be considered in his construed\u00a7 2254 \n6 proceeding. Movant must file a separate civil lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S. \u00a7 1983 if \nhe intends to seek monetary damages for an alleged constitutional violation. See \nMuhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004); Preiser v. Rodrigue z, 411 U.S. \n475, 498-99 (1973); Heckv. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 485-86 (1994). \nC. Movant's Request for a Declaratory Judgment Against the United \nStates \nIn his \"Notice of Declaratory Judgment \" against the United States, Movant \nasserts that the United States lacked jurisdiction to charge and/or indict him on \ncharges of possession of a firearm by a person prohibited. (D.I. 80 at 2) For relief, \nhe asks \"to be provided with right, reason, and legal copies of the [United States'] \nlegal jurisdiction [and/or] authority order to charge and indict Movant\" with an \noffense within the State of Delaware 's jurisdiction . (D.I. 80 at 3) Movant also \nseeks the dismissal of his federal indictment and vacation of his federal sentence. \n(D.I. 80 at 3) In his Notice of Fault and Opportunity to Cure, Movant reasserts his \nrequest that the Government prove its authority to indict him and seeks the \ndismissal of his federal indictment and vacation of his federal sentence if the \nGovernment fails to do so. (D.I. 83 at 1) \n\"A declaratory judgment is appropriate where it will: (1) clarify and settle \nlegal relations in issue and (2) terminate and afford greater relief from the \nuncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to present action.\" Am. Inst. for \nChartered Prop. Cas. Underwriters v. Potter, 2021 WL 431475, at *11 (D. Del. \n7 Feb. 8, 2021). \"Declaratory judgments[ ... ] are meant to define the legal rights and \nobligations of the parties in the anticipation of some future conduct.\" Johnson v. \nMcCuskey, 72 F. App'x 475, 477 (7th Cir. 2003); see also Corliss v. O'Brien, 200 \nF. App'x 80, 84 (3d Cir. 2006) (\"Declaratory judgment is inappropriate solely to \nadjudicate past conduct\" and is also not \"meant simply to proclaim that one party \nis liable to another.\"). Here, Movant is not seeking \"declaratory relief in the true \nlegal sense\" because he seeks a declaration from the Court that the Government \nviolated his rights in the past rather than a declaration of the parties' rights in the \nfuture. Corliss, 200 F. App'x at 84. Thus, Movant is not entitled to declaratory \nrelief. \nTo the extent Movant seeks to have his indictment dismissed and sentence \nvacated, Movant is challenging the validity of his 2007 conviction. Movant, \nhowever, cannot seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because he is no longer in \nfederal custody on his 2007 conviction.2 See, e.g., Pileggi v. United States, 2022 \nWL 2375166, at *2 (M.D. Pa. June 30, 2022). \n2The documents attached to Movant's Notice for Declaratory Judgment against the \nState demonstrates that Movant's sentence for his federal 2007 felon-in-possession \nconviction had completely expired by the time he filed the instant Notice for \nDeclaratory Judgment against the United States. (D.I. 70 at 2-3); see Johnson, \n2022 WL 3694880, at* 1. \n8 The Court acknowledges that it could liberally construe the Notices to be a \npetition for writ of error coram nobis.3 The availability of coram nobis relief is \nlimited to situations where the movant satisfies the following five prerequisites: (1) \nhe is no longer in custody pursuant to the challenged conviction; (2) he suffers \ncontinuing consequences from the allegedly invalid conviction; (3) he provides \nsound reasons for not seeking relief earlier; ( 4) he had no available remedy at the \ntime of trial; and (5) he asserts error of a fundamental kind. See Ragbir v. United \nStates, 950 F.3d 54, 62 (3d Cir. 2020). \nMovant does not allege sufficient facts to satisfy the aforementioned \nprerequisites. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, the Court will dismiss \nthe construed coram no bis request with leave to amend. If Movant intends to \npursue coram no bis relief with respect to his 2007 federal conviction, he shall file \nan Amended Petition within twenty-eight days of the date of this Memorandum \nand Order. \nAn appropriate Order follows. \nDated: December ~2022 \nUnited States District Court Judge \n3Federal courts have authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis under the All \nWrits Act, which permits \"courts established by an Act of Congress\" to issue \"all \nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1651. \n9 "}
