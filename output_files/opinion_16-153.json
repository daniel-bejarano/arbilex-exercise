(collectively, \u201cSprint\u201d)  have filed \na Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment  in this case .  Dkt. No. 601.  Sprint argues that plaintiff \nTC Technology LLC (\u201cTC Tech\u201d) made statements in an ex parte reexami nation proceeding that \nresulted in a disavowal of claim scope , that the disavowal requires that claim construction in the \ncase be revised, and that under the revised claim construction, TC Tech cannot show that Sprint \nhas infringed TC Tech\u2019s asserted paten t claims .  For the reasons set forth below, the motion is \nDENIED.  \n1. Background  \nPlaintiff TC Technology LLC (\u201cTC Tech\u201d) filed this action on March 10, 2016, alleging \nthat Sprint  had infringed claims 1 and 2 of U.S. Patent No. 5,815,488 (\u201cthe \u2019488 patent\u201d).  On \nMarch 23, 2021, after substantial pretrial activities  had occurred in the district court, T-Mobile \nUSA, Inc., (\u201cT -Mobile\u201d) submitted a request for an ex parte reexamination of the two asserted \nclaims by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) .  The reexamination was \ninstituted, and after the PTO examiner issued a non- final office action rejecting both of the asserted 2 claims, I entered a stay of the district court proceedings.  Dkt. No. 596.  The examiner ultimately \nconfirmed the patentability of both claims, Dkt. No. 597, Exh. 1, and I lifted the stay, Dkt. No. 600.  Sprint now argues that TC Tech made statements to the examiner  during the reexamination \nthat are inconsistent with TC Tech\u2019s  infringement theory in this case, and that summary judgment \nof noninfringement should therefore be granted.  Dkt. No. 602 at 1. \nThe present dispute relates to the \u201ccentral location\u201d limitation of both asserted claims.  \nClaim 1, which is representative, recites a \u201cmethod for enabling a plurality of remote locations to transmit data to a central location.\u201d  \u2019488 patent, claim 1.  One of the limitatio ns of claim 1 recites, \n\u201cat each remote location, utilizing a modulator to modulate said block of time domain data onto a \ncarrier signal for transmission to said central location, said carrier signal  having the same carrier \nfrequency for each remote locatio n.\u201d  Id.  (emphasis added).  Earlier in this case, Judge Andrews \nconstrued the \u201csame carrier frequency\u201d limitation to mean that \u201ceach and every \u2018remote location\u2019 that transmits data to the \u2018central location\u2019\u201d must use the same carrier frequency.   Dkt. No. 354 at \n13.  Judge Andrews later construed the term \u201ccentral location\u201d to mean \u201cthe equipment at a physical location that performs the claimed functions of the \u2018central location.\u2019\u201d  Dkt. No. 452 at 6.  \nThe parties dispute whether one of Sprint\u2019s accused base stations contain s more than one \n\u201ccentral location ,\u201d as claimed in the \u2019488 patent.  Sprint argues that no central location may share \nany equipment with another central location.  Dkt. No. 602 at 11\u201312.  TC Tech argues that each sector of a base station may be considered a separate central location.  Dkt. No. 354 at 8.  Judge \nAndrews ruled that the number of c entral locations within one of Sprint\u2019s accused base stations is \na question of fact .  Id. at 8\u20139.  I have accepted Judge Andrews\u2019 ruling on that issue, and I adhere \nto it. 3 In instituting the reexamination and initially rejecting the asserted claims, the ex aminer \nrelied upon PCT Patent Publication No. WO 94/11961 (\u201cKahre\u201d).  Dkt. No. 592, Exh. B, at 4.  T -\nMobile argued, and the examiner agreed, that the \u201cbase station\u201d in Kahre corresponded to the \n\u201ccentral location\u201d limitation of the asserted claims.  Id.  at 12.  TC Tech responded by arguing to \nthe examiner that , accepting the proposition that the base station in Kahre constituted a central \nlocation (a  proposition that TC Tech  expressly reserved the right to dispute ), Kahre  did not teach \nthe \u201csame carrier frequency\u201d limitation , because Kahre contemplated the use of multiple carrier \nfrequencies by the same base station.  Dkt. No. 599, Exh. A, at 38\u201339, 43.  Sprint now argues that \nTC Tech\u2019s arguments to the examiner on that point had the effect of disclaiming patent coverage \nfor any system in which the accused method involved the use of base stations containing more \nthan one \u201ccentral location.\u201d  Dkt. No. 602 at 11.  \n2. Discussion  \nUnder the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer, statem ents made during a reexamination \nproceeding can result in disavowal of claim scope if the alleged disavow al is  \u201cclear and \nunmistakable.\u201d  Omega Eng\u2019g, Inc . v. Raytek Corp. , 334 F.3d 1314, 1325\u201326 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ; \nNorthpeak Wireless, LLC v. 3COM Corp., 674 F. App\u2019 x 982, 986 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2016)  (applying \nprosecution disclaimer to statements made in an ex parte reexamination) .  Sprint points to TC \nTech\u2019s statement that \u201cKahre does not and cannot teach [the same carrier frequency limitation] of claim 1 \u201d as evidence of TC Tech\u2019s alleged disavowal.  Dkt. No. 602 at 9 (quoting Dkt. No. 599, \nExh. A, at 44).  When read in context, however, that statement does not constitute a disavowal of claim scope.  \nTC Tech made clear in multiple instances that it was not disclaiming base stations that \ncontain more than one central location.  TC Tech pointed out to the examiner that in its view, \u201ca 4 base station can contain numerous central locations depending on the architecture, configuration, \nsoftware, and hardware employed .\u201d  Dkt. No. 599, Exh. A at 38.  However, TC Tech stated that , \nfor purposes of argument , it was willing to \u201caccept[] the Patent Office\u2019s contention that the entire \nKahre base station is a single central location .\u201d  Id.  TC Tech reiterated th at position i n its \ndiscussion of the \u201csame carrier frequency\u201d limitation when it noted that the base station in Kahre was, \u201caccording to the Patent Office and [T -Mobile\u2019s expert],\u201d the central location.  Id.  at 43.   \nTC Tech argued to the examiner that the base station  in Kahre could not satisfy the \u201csame \ncarrier frequency\u201d limitation because the base station in Kahre employs multiple carrier frequencies.  Id.  at 43.  It is clear that TC Tech\u2019s statement that Kahre \u201cdoes not and cannot teach\u201d \nthe \u201csame carrier frequency\u201d limitation was made in view of the examiner\u2019s assertion that the base station in Kahre represented the central location.  See id.  at 43 \u201344.  In th e present litigation, TC \nTech argues that each secto r of each of Sprint\u2019s base stations is a central location, which is \nconsistent with its position that a single base station employing multiple carrier frequencies cannot \nserve as the claimed central location.  Whether or not TC Tech\u2019s distinction of Kahre is ultimately \npersuasive, TC Tech\u2019s infringement position is not inconsistent with the arguments it made during \nthe reexamination.   \nSprint further argues that even if TC Tech\u2019s statements do not amount to a disclaimer, \nSprint is still entitled to summary judgment because \u201cthe claims do not permit any of the  \n\u2018equipment\u2019 that constitutes the \u2018central location\u2019 . . . to service remote locations transmitting on multiple frequencies.\u201d  Dkt. No. 602 at 11.  Th at argument is simply a rehash of Sprint\u2019s previous \nsummary judgment position that one of Sprint\u2019s base stations must be regarded as a single central \nlocation.  See id.  at 11 \u201312; Dkt. No. 354 at 8.  As noted, the question of how many central locations \nmay be contained within one of Sprint\u2019s base stations is a question of fact.  None of TC Tech\u2019s 5 statements made during the reexamination warrant s revisiting that determination .  Sprint\u2019s motion \nis theref ore DENIED.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nSIGNED this 11t h day of March , 2022.  \n \n \n        \n        \n       ______________________________ \nWILLIAM C. BRYSON  \n       UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE  \n  \n \n"}
