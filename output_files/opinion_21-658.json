C. \n\u00a7 2704(b) or claims of unjust enrichment that survive to him by operation of 10 \nDel. \u00a7 3701;  \nd) Whether Wells Fargo  is entitled to invoke the benefit of any arbitration agreement \nbetween Mr. Carmel  and GIII (either because it signed the purported BIPA on \nbehalf of GIII; because of its relationship as  GIII\u2019s  trustee, securities intermediary, \nor agent ; because Mr. Carmel would be compelled to arbitrate claims against Wells \nFargo because of estoppel  arising out of the alleged intertwin ing of Wells Fargo\u2019s \nactions and GIII\u2019s ; or under some other theory) and whether Mr. Warlen\u2019s status  as \na non- signatory affects the outcome of that question;  \ne) Whether Wells Fargo was a \u201cpayee\u201d or \u201cassignee\u201d of the Policy within the meaning \nof 18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(b) because it received a payment of benefits (even if it later \npaid benefits to another entity) and, if so, whether that creates an independent basis \nfor Wells Fargo to be liable to Plaintiff and whether that affects the application  of \nestoppel;  5 \n f) Whether the BIPA shows a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d agreement  to delegate  \nquestions about the arbitrability  of claims like those asserted in this case to an \narbitrator and whether Mr. Warlen  or Wells Fargo , as non-signator ies of the \npurported BIPA, are subject to any such agreement;  \ng) If questions of arbitrability ( i.e., scope)  are to be determined by the Court, whether \nPlaintiff\u2019s claims  against the respective Defendants  under 18 Del. C. \u00a7 2704(b) and \nfor unjust enrichment \u201caris[e] under [the BIPA] ;\u201d and \nh) Whether, if the Court determines that some claims are arbitrable but some are not, \nthe Court should exercise its discretion to stay the remaining asserted claims.  \n4.
