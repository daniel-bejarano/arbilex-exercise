Vergnano, and Mark E. Newman. D.I. 30 ,r,r 18-\n22. Vergnano was at all relevant times Chemours 's President and CEO. Newman \nwas at all relevant times Chemours's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial \nOfficer. D.I. 30 ,r 22. The Complaint alleges two claims, each arising from a \nseries of alleged misrepresentations in annual and quarterly reports Chemours filed \nwith the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) between February 16, 2017, and \nAugust 1, 2019 (the Class Period). Count I of the Complaint alleges that all three \nDefendants violated\u00a7 1 0(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Count II \nalleges that Vergano and Newman violated\u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act. D.I. 30 \n,r,r 303-318. \nPending before me is Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). D.I. 34. \nI. BACKGROUND \nBecause I am assessing the merits of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, I \naccept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and in documents explicitly \nrelied upon in the Complaint. See Mgmt. Sci. Assocs., Inc. v. Datavant , Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 238,244 (D. Del. 2020). The following background information is \nbased on those allegations. \nChemours is a Delaware corporation that produces industrial and specialty \nchemical products. It was formed in 2015 as a spin-off of the performance \nchemicals division of the DuPont Company. DuPont orchestrated the spin-off as \npart of a plan to try to off-load its historical environmental liabilities. D.I. 30 ,I 3. \nPursuant to a separation agreement that established the terms of the spin-off, \nChemours assumed at the time of its formation many of these liabilities and agreed \nto indemnify DuPont for certain contingent liabilities. D.I. 30 ,I 40. The liabilities \nincluded among other things remediation costs for certain contaminated sites and \nlegal claims arising out of DuPont's manufacture of perfluorooctanoic acid \n(PFOA), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PF AS), and benzene. D.I. \n30 ,I 40. \nUnder Delaware law, DuPont's board could not approve the spin-off unless \nit could establish that Chemours would be solvent and viable as an independent \ncompany at the time of its inception. D.I. 30 ,I 57. To that end, the board obtained \nfrom a financial adviser a solvency opinion. In issuing that opinion, the adviser \nrelied on \"High End (Maximum) Realistic Exposure\" calculations certified by \nDuPont's management for the environmental liabilities and indemnification \nobligations Chemours assumed under the separation agreement. D.I. 30 ,I 60. \n2 The spin-off was completed on July 1, 2015, and Chemours's stock began \ntrading on the New York Stock Exchange on that date. Chemours struggled from \nthe outset. Its stock price plummeted by some 85% soon after its formation. D.I. \n30 ,r 41. \nVergnano recognized \"right from the start\" that because of Chem ours' s \ninherited liabilities \"investors were worried if [Chemours] was going to be \nsolvent.\" D.I. 30 ,r 45 (underline omitted). To assuage investor concerns, \nVergnano touted a so-called \"Transformation Plan\" put in place by Chemours to \nenhance its ability to pay back its debts over time. D.I. 30 ,r,r 43-45. In a similar \nvein, Newman assured investors during Chemours' s first earnings call in August \n2015 that he, Vergnano, and other members of Chemours' s executive team had \npreviously run DuPont's performance chemicals division; that they had been \npersonally monitoring the liabilities inherited from DuPont for a long time; and \nthat Chem ours' s inherited environmental liabilities were \"well understood and well \nmanaged.\" D.I. 30 ,r 46 (underline omitted). \nOn February 7, 2017, Chemours filed with the SEC the first often annual \n(Form 10-K) and quarterly (Form 10-Q) reports that fall within the Class Period. \nD.I. 30 ,r 5. Consistent with SEC regulations, Chemours stated in each of the \nreports that the financial disclosures in the respective report were prepared in \naccordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). See, e.g., \n3 D.I. 43-3 at 9 {\"The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have \nbeen prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the \nUnited States of America (GAAP) .... \"). 1 All ten reports were signed by \nVergnano and Newman; and, according to the Complaint, all ten contained \nstatements that \"dramatically mischaracterized Chem ours' [ s] true financial \ncondition and vastly understated [Chemours]'s liabilities from decades of \nenvironmental pollution.\" D.I. 30 ,r 1. \n1 The Exchange Act provides the SEC with the authority to prescribe among other \nthings rules for reporting earnings statements and balance sheets. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n78m(b )( 1 ). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 permits the SEC to \"recognize, as \n'generally accepted' for purposes of the securities laws, any accounting principles \nestablished by a standard setting body\" meeting certain criteria. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n77s(b)(l); Commission Guidance Regarding the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard's Accounting Standards Codification, 74 Fed.

SEC \nRegulation S-X provides that \"[f]inancial statements filed with the [SEC] [that] are \nnot prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles will be \npresumed to be misleading or inaccurate ... unless the [SEC] has otherwise \nprovided.\" 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.4-0l{a)(l); see also 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.8-0l(a) (requiring \n\"smaller reporting companies\" to use GAAP). \n4 The Complaint alleges that Defendants \"admitted the falsity of the[ se] \nstatements\" in a complaint Chemours filed against DuPont in May 2019 in the \nDelaware Court of Chancery. D.I. 30 ,I I. Nine of the 320 paragraphs in the \nsprawling, 162-page Complaint filed in this action effectively summarize the \ntotality of Plaintiff's allegations and its theory of liability: \n5. . . . . Beginning with the Company's 2016 Form \n10-K filed on February 17, 2017 at the start of the Class \nPeriod-and in each of the Company's quarterly and \nannual reports filed after that-Chemours added language \nthat it had never used before with respect to its disclosed \nmaximum liability ranges, stating that there was only a \n\"remote\" chance that the Company's liabilities would \nexceed its accruals \"up to\" those specified maximum \namounts. Defendants also celebrated the purported \nsuccess of their \"transformation plan,\" emphatically \nproclaiming that Chemours in \"no way\" had been \"set up \nto fail,\" and repeatedly touting Chemours'[s] \"strong\" and \n\"de-risked\" balance sheet that sparked a \"turnaround\" that \nwas \"nothing short of remarkable.\" \n6. Investors and securities analysts heavily relied on \nand credited Defendants' statements, including \nChemours'[s] purported maximum liability caps. Indeed, \non the heels of these representations, analysts concluded \nthat Chemours had \"healed tremendously from its spin-out \nof DuPont,\" noting that the Company had \"reduced its risk \nportfolio\" and \"reduced litigation risk\" because its \n\"balance sheet [and] liabilities [were] cleaned up.\" Fueled \nby Defendants' assurances, the Company's stock price \nsoared, peaking at over $58 per share on October 24, 2017. \n7. . . . [A] 11 of these statements were patently false. In \n[the Chancery Court Complaint] signed and verified by \nDefendant Newman, and originally filed under seal in \nDelaware Chancery Court on May 13, 2019 . . . , \n5 Chemours asserted that prior to the spinoff, DuPont \nengaged in a \"sham\" process of deliberately certifying \n\"systematically and spectacularly wrong\" maximum \nestimates for each of Chem ours' [ s] inherited liabilities in \norder to claim that it was complying with Delaware law, \nwhich required that spun off companies be viable and \nsolvent. However, in reality, and in Chemours' own \nwords, the previously undisclosed liabilities were so \n\"huge,\" \"radical and extraordinary,\" and \"staggering\"\u00ad\nand, rather than \"remote,\" virtually inevitable-that \nChem ours admitted \"in no uncertain terms\" that, \"as of the \ndate of the spin, Chemours was insolvent\" in violation of \nDelaware law [if the liability caps did not apply, D.I. 42-1 \n,I 10]. \n8. Significantly, the [Chancery Court] Complaint \nidentified approximately $2.5 billion in imminent \nenvironmental liabilities-a staggering amount that was \nnearly eight times Chemours' $313 million in Class Period \naccruals; dwarfed the maximum liability amounts that \nDefendants asserted were only \"remotely\" possible, which \naveraged less than $500 million; and greatly exceeded its \navailable cash of $700 million, net assets of $816 million, \nand even its market capitalization of $2.4 billion at the end \nof the Class Period .... \n9. There can be no doubt that Defendants-who, along \nwith other Chem ours' senior executives, had over 120 \nyears of combined experience at DuPont, and who were \nthe same individuals who directly operated the sites \ninherited from DuPont-at all times were fully aware of \nthe Company's overwhelming and undisclosed liabilities. \nBy Defendants' own admission, they knew from \nChemours' inception that DuPont's estimated maximums \nfor the inherited liabilities were \"baseless concoction[s],\" \nand that, in truth, these liabilities were so massive that they \nrendered Chemours legally \"insolvent.\" ... \n10. In addition, highly placed former employees of \nDuPont and Chemours-including some of the most \n6 senior officers of the Company-further confirmed \nDefendants' direct knowledge of and participation in the \nfraud. Former employees who worked directly with \nDefendants unequivocally confirmed that \"Chemours \nleadership knew exactly the extent of the liabilities they \nwere tal<lng over\" and that Defendants were personally \nconfronted during the Class Period with a detailed account \ncalculating the need for billions in environmental \nremediation costs. Despite these facts, from the time of \nthe spinoff and throughout the Class Period, Defendants \ndid nothing to properly account for Chemours' staggering \nliabilities. \n11. Defendants' fraud was exposed in a series of \ndisclosures that gradually revealed Defendants' fraud and \nChemours'[s] true financial condition. In early May 2019, \na prominent analyst presented research showing that \nChem ours' [ s] true liabilities were substantially greater \nthan what it had disclosed, triggering a 15% drop in \nChemours' [ s] stock price. Chemours vehemently denied \nthat was the case and asserted that it was adequately \nreserved for any potential liabilities. \n12. However, contemporaneous with those denials, \nChemours filed its lawsuit against DuPont under seal in \nwhich it admitted that its liabilities were so large that they \nrendered the Company insolvent. When the lawsuit was \nunsealed in late June, Chemours'[s] stock price plunged \nanother 15%, and stunned analysts reported that Chemours \nhad now \"quantified potential high-end liabilities of \napproximately $2.5 billion\" that were \"materially higher \nthan expected.\" \n13. Finally, on August 1, 2019, Chemours reported a \nsignificant and unexpected increase in PF AS litigation \ncoupled with a substantial reduction in free cash flow \nguidance, and the stock fell another 19% to close at $14.69 \nper share on August 2, 2019. All told, these disclosures \nwiped out $2 billion in market capitalization, and have \ncaused massive losses to investors who purchased \n7 Chemours common stock at artificially inflated prices \nduring the Class Period. \nD .I. 3 0 ,r,r 5-13 ( emphases and some alterations in the original; footnotes \nomitted). \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Sections lO(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act \nSection lO(b) prohibits the \"use or employ[ment], in connection with the \npurchase or sale of any security ... [ of] any manipulative or deceptive device or \ncontrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may \nprescribe.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b ). Rule 1 Ob-5, the SEC's corresponding \nimplementing regulation, makes it unlawful \n(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to \ndefraud, \n(b) To make any untrue statement of a material \nfact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order \nto make the statements made, in the light of the \ncircumstances under which they were made, not \nmisleading, or \n(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of \nbusiness which operates or would operate as a fraud or \ndeceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase \nor sale of any security. \n17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.lOb-5. \nTo state a claim for securities fraud under Rule lOb-5, a plaintiff\"must \nplead ( 1) a material misrepresentation or omission, (2) scienter, (3) a connection \n8 between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security, \n( 4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission, (5) economic loss, and (6) loss \ncausation.\" In re Hertz Glob. Holdings Inc., 905 F .3d 106, 114 (3d Cir. 2018); see \nalso Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005) (identifying same \nelements). An individual's liability for fraudulent misrepresentations made in \nviolation of Rule 1 0b-5 can be imputed to the company that employs the \nindividual. See Institutional Invs. Grp. v. Avaya, Inc., 564 F.3d 242, 251-52 (3d \nCir. 2009) (holding that \"liability for [two employees'] statements, if they were \nfraudulent, can also be imputed to [the company the employees worked for] \nbecause ' [a] corporation is liable for statements by employees who have apparent \nauthority to make them.\"' ( citation omitted) (last alteration in the original)). \nSection 20( a) of the Exchange Act creates a derivative cause of action \nagainst individuals who exercise control of a \"controlled person,\" including a \ncorporation, that has violated\u00a7 l0(b). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a); Avaya, 564 F.3d at 252. \nTo establish a violation of\u00a7 20(a), a plaintiff must prove that a third party under \nthe defendant's control violated the Exchange Act and that the defendant was a \n\"culpable participant\" in the unlawful conduct. Belmont v. MB Inv. Partners, Inc., \n708 F.3d 470, 484 (3d Cir. 2013). \n9 B. Pleading Standards \nWhen considering a Rule l 2(b )( 6) motion to dismiss, the court must accept \nas true all factual allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most \nfavorable to plaintiffs. Umland v. Planco Financial, 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. \n2008). The court may consider only the allegations in the complaint and the \ndocuments incorporated into the complaint by reference and matters of which the \ncourt may take judicial notice. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd., 55 l U.S. \n308, 322 (2007). \nIn general, to state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must \ncontain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must include more than \nmere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause \nof action.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) ( citation \nomitted). And it must set forth enough facts, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.\" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. A claim is facially \nplausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation omitted). Deciding whether a \nclaim is plausible is a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to \ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. at 679 ( citation omitted). \n10 Plaintiffs alleging a claim in securities fraud must also satisfy the heightened \npleading standards imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \n(PSLRA). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b); see also Avaya, 564 F.3d at 252-53. As the \nCourt explained in Avaya: \nThe PSLRA provides two distinct pleading requirements, \nboth of which must be met in order for a complaint to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss. First, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n78u-4(b )( 1 ), the complaint must \"specify each allegedly \nmisleading statement, why the statement was misleading, \nand, if an allegation is made on information and belief, \nall facts supporting that belief with particularity.\" \nSecond, the complaint must, \"with respect to each act or \nomission alleged to violate this chapter, state with \nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that \nthe defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b )(2). \nSignificantly, both provisions require facts to be pleaded \n\"with particularity.\" As we have explained, this \nparticularity language echoes precisely Rule 9(b ). \nIndeed, although the PSLRA replaced Rule 9(b) as the \npleading standard governing private securities class \nactions, Rule 9(b)' s particularity requirement is \ncomparable to and effectively subsumed by the \nrequirements of\u00a7 78u-4(b){l) of the PSLRA. This \nstandard requires plaintiffs to plead the who, what, when, \nwhere, and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper \nstory. Section 78u-4(b )(1) adds an additional \nrequirement where \"an allegation regarding a defendant's \nstatement or omission is made on information and \nbelief.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b){l). In those circumstances, \nplaintiffs must also state with particularity all facts on \nwhich that belief is formed. That is, when allegations are \nmade on information and belief, the complaint must not \nonly state the allegations with factual particularity, but \nmust also describe the sources of information with \n11 particularity, providing the who, what, when, where and \nhow of the sources, as well as the who, what, when, \nwhere, and how of the information those sources convey. \nThe PSLRA's requirement for pleading scienter, on the \nother hand, marks a sharp break with Rule 9(b ). Under \n\u00a7 78u-4(b )(2), a plaintiff can no longer plead the \nrequisite sci enter element generally, as he previously \ncould under Rule 9(b ). Instead, under the PSLRA' s \n\"exacting\" pleading standard for scienter, any private \nsecurities complaint alleging that the defendant made a \nfalse or misleading statement must state with particularity \nfacts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant \nacted with the required state of mind. \n564 F .3d at 252-53 ( cleaned up). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nDefendants argue three independent grounds for dismissal of Plaintiffs \n\u00a7 l0(b) claim: (1) Plaintiff failed to plead that Defendants made any actionable \nmaterially false or misleading statements or omissions, (2) Plaintiff failed to plead \nparticularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter, and (3) Plaintiff \nfailed to plead that the alleged misrepresentations caused Chemours stockholders \nto suffer any loss. D.I. 35 at 4.2 Defendants seek dismissal of the\u00a7 20(a) claim for \nfailure to plead the underlying\u00a7 l0(b) securities fraud. D.I. 35 at 4. \n2 Defendants also argue without elaboration in a footnote in their briefing that \"a \nnumber of the challenged statements were made before October 8, 2017, which is \ntwo years before this litigation commenced,\" and that \"[a]ny claim based on \ndisclosures [made] prior to that date\" are barred by the statute of limitations. D.I. \n35 at 15 n.8. And they argue in another footnote that \"Chemours's forward-\n12 A. Actionable False Statements and Omissions \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff \"has not pleaded that any of th[ e] disclosures \n[made in Chemours's SEC filings] were false,\" D.I. 35 at 16, and that the alleged \nmisstatements in the challenged SEC reports are \"otherwise inactionable\" because \nthey are opinions, mere puffery, and protected by the PSLRA's safe harbor, D.I. 35 \nat 25-31. Plaintiff counters that the Complaint \"adequately alleges\" five \ncategories of actionable misrepresentations: ( 1) false statements about maximum \nremediation liabilities, D.I. 37 at 18-21; (2) false statements that certain liabilities \nand ranges of losses were not estimable, D.I. 37 at 22-23; (3) false statements that \nasserted liabilities would have no material impact on Chemours, D.I. 37 at 23-24; \n(4) false statements that \"project[ed] a fa9ade of financial strength through \nadditional plain language assurances,\" D.I. 37 at 24; and (5) financial disclosures \ninconsistent with GAAP, D.I. 37 at 28-32.3 \nlooking disclosures are also protected [ from liability] under the 'bespeaks caution' \ndoctrine.\" D.I. 35 at 29 n.15 (citation omitted). These \"passing reference[s] to an \nissue will not suffice to bring that issue before this court.\" Skretvedt v. E.1 DuPont \nDe Nemours, 372 F.3d 193, 202-03 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted); see also John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'/ Corp., 119 F.3d \n1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"[A]rguments raised in passing (such as, in a \nfootnote), but not squarely argued, are considered waived.\") ( citation omitted)). \n3 Plaintiff initially argued that the Complaint also adequately alleged false \nstatements about Chem ours' s discharges of the chemical GenX into the Cape Fear \nRiver, but it withdrew that contention at oral argument. D.I. 51 at 81, 11. 2-13. \n13 1. Statements About Maximum Remediation Liabilities \nAccording to Plaintiff: \nIn each of Chemours' [ s] annual and quarterly SEC filings \nduring the Class Period, Defendants set forth \nChemours'[s] maximum possible environmental \nremediation liability by asserting that the \"potential \nliability may range up to\" certain specific limits above the \nCompany's GAAP accruals, but only \"under adverse \nchanges in circumstances,\" which they \"deemed\" highly \nl.k 1 \u00b7 \" \" un 1 e y, i.e., remote. \nEach of these statements was materially false and \nmisleading when made. The [Chancery Court Complaint] \nspecifically itemized $2.5 billion of inherited liabilities as \nof the time of the spin-off. Moreover, Defendants \nspecifically informed the Court of Chancery that the $2.5 \nbillion included \"probable\" losses and was a low figure \nthat was \"nowhere near the maximum.\" By contrast, \nDefendants' Class Period representations of maximum \n\"potential liability\" specified only, on average, \"up to\" \n$780 million in total liability. In other words, Defendants' \nmaximum liability \"up to\" figures indisputably \nrepresented less than one-third of the conservative \nliability itemized in the [Chancery Court pleading]. \nD.I. 3 7 at 18-19 ( emphases in the original; footnotes and citations omitted). \nPlaintiff also alleges that a report and presentations shared with Defendants by \nnonparty Paul Kirsch (identified in the Complaint as \"Confidential Witness 3\") \nshow that Defendants falsely represented in the challenged SEC reports \nChemours's maximum liability figures. D.I. 37 at 15; D.I. 30 ,r,r 127-133. \nDefendants' threshold argument appears to be that Chem ours never \ndisclosed maximum liabilities in the challenged SEC reports. See D.I. 35 at 1-2, \n14 17-19. According to Defendants, the \"maximum estimates\" Chemours accused \nDuPont in the Chancery Court Complaint of understating \"were supposed to reflect \nChemours's maximum possible exposure going forward\" as an independent \ncompany in 2015 and \"were not intended to comply with GAAP.\" D.I. 35 at 1. \nDefendants insist that \"[m]aximium exposure is not an accounting concept\" and \nthat GAAP does not require a company to disclose its best estimate of its \nmaximum liability. D.I. 35 at 17. \nDefendants are correct that \"maximum exposure\" is not a GAAP concept \nand that companies are not required to disclose in their SEC reports estimates of \ntheir maximum potential liabilities. {Indeed, in 2010, the F ASB rejected a proposal \nto require disclosure for loss contingencies of either \"[t]he amount of the claim or \nassessment\" or \"the entity's best estimate of the maximum exposure to loss\" \nbecause disclosure of \"maximum exposure to loss\" would be \"too costly,\" \n\"prejudicial,\" and misleading. Proposed Accounting Standards Update: \nContingencies {Topic 450): Disclosure of Certain Loss Contingencies 40, Fin. \nStandards Accounting Board (July 20, 2010), \nhttps://asc.fasb.org/imageRoot/73/6954873.pdf; D.I. 42-9 at 40.) But Defendants' \nargument misses the point. As Defendants concede in their briefing, Chemours \n\"disclosed more than it had to by providing, starting in February 2017, higher \nclean-up costs that might result 'under adverse changes in circumstances, although \n15 deemed remote.\"' D.I. 35 at 24. And once Chemours chose to make that \ndisclosure-even if not required by GAAP or otherwise-it had to speak \ntruthfully. See Ackerman v. Schwartz, 947 F.2d 841, 848 (7th Cir. 1991) (\"Under \nRule 1 0b-5, ... the lack of an independent duty [to disclose] does not excuse a \nmaterial lie.\"); see also Williams v. Globus Med., Inc., 869 F.3d 235,241 (3d Cir. \n2017) (\"Once a company has chosen to speak on an issue-even an issue it had no \nindependent obligation to address-it cannot omit material facts related to that \nissue so as to make its disclosure misleading.\"). \nA reasonable investor could have plausibly inferred from the language \nDefendants used to \"provide\" in the challenged SEC reports Chem ours' s \"higher \nclean-up costs\" that Chemours was disclosing its maximum potential remediation \nliabilities. In each of the challenged SEC reports, Chem ours stated in both the \nreport's Notes to the Financial Statements and the report's section titled \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperation (MD&A) that \"considerable uncertainty exists with respect to \nenvironmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, \nalthough deemed remote, the potential liability may range up to approximately [ an \nidentified excess sum] above [a specific disclosed amount accrued].\" D.I. 43-3 at \n20 ( emphasis added). A plausible, indeed a reasonable, reading of this awkwardly \nphrased statement is that Defendants believed (1) that there was only a remote (i.e., \n16 slight) possibility that Chemours would incur its maximum potential liability, and \n(2) that that maximum potential liability would not exceed (i.e., \"may range up to\") \nthe sum total of the identified excess sum plus the specific disclosed amount \naccrued. Thus, by this statement and the disclosure of the excess sums and the \namounts accrued, Defendants effectively represented in each of the challenged \nSEC reports that they believed Chem ours' s maximum potential remediation \nliabilities were capped at the sums of those two figures. According to the \nComplaint, those sums ranged from $763 million to $827 million, and averaged \n$780 million. D.I. 30 ,r 113. \na. Whether Plaintiff Alleged False Maximum Liability \nDisclosures \nThe question then is whether Plaintiff has alleged in the Complaint facts \nsufficient to plausibly imply that Defendants did not in fact believe that \nChem ours' s environmental remediation liabilities were capped at the sums \ndisclosed in the SEC reports. Plaintiff says it has done so, and it points to its \nallegation that Chemours \"specifically itemized\" in the Chancery Court Complaint \n\"$2.5 billion of inherited liabilities as of the time of the spin-off' and its \nallegations concerning Kirsch's report and presentations. \n1) The Chancery Court Complaint \nChemours alleged in the Chancery Court Complaint that it faced damages \nclaims and judgments arising out of the liabilities it inherited from DuPont that \n17 totaled approximately $2.5 billion. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants \"admitted\" in \nthe Chancery Court Complaint that this $2.5 billion figure consisted of six \nliabilities: (1) $335 million incurred for a settlement of a multi-district litigation \nfiled against DuPont in Ohio; (2) $111 million \"for benzene liability\"; (3) $194 \nmillion \"for inherited PFAS liability\"; ( 4) $200 million in remediation costs for the \nFayetteville Works site in North Carolina; (5) $1.1 billion sought by a New Jersey \nmunicipality in a lawsuit to recover remediation costs for the Chambers Works site \nin New Jersey; and (6) $620 million in remediation costs for four New Jersey sites. \nD.I. 30 ,I 111. \nThe first three liabilities are not alleged to be for environmental remediation \nand therefore a reasonable juror could not draw any inferences based on those \nliabilities about Defendants' knowledge of Chem ours' s maximum environmental \nremediation liabilities. There are no allegations in the Complaint that the \"benzene \nliability\" and \"PF AS liability\" were for environmental remediation costs. And \nPlaintiff alleges in the Complaint that the multi-district litigation that resulted in \nthe $335 million settlement was for medical-based tort claims brought by 3,500 \nindividuals exposed to PFOA. See D.I. 30 at ,I,I 74, 111. \nWith respect to the fourth item, Plaintiff alleges that \"Defendants admitted \nto, and specifically quantified [in the Chancery Court Complaint] ... over $200 \nmillion for the remediation of Fayetteville Works site.\" D.I. 30 il 111. But this \n18 allegation mischaracterizes the Chancery Court Complaint. Here is what \nChemours in fact alleged in the Chancery Court Complaint: \nIn February 2019, after extensive negotiations with the \nState, Chemours entered a consent order with North \nCarolina to settle the State's claims on terms that were \nsubject to public comment and approved as fair and \nappropriate by the Court. Among other things, the \nconsent order requires Chemours to adopt the very-same \nabatement technology that DuPont previously declined to \ninstall and to undertake extensive remediation regarding \nthe cumulative effects of DuPont's long-running \nhistorical emissions. The cost to Chemours will be in \nexcess of $200 million .... \nD.I. 42-1 ,r 86. Thus, Chemours admitted only that in February 2019-i.e., after all \nbut two of the challenged SEC reports were filed-it entered into a consent decree \nthat would at some point cause it to incur $200 million in costs and that some \nunstated portion of those costs would be allocated for remediation efforts. Since \nChemours did not allege in the Chancery Court Complaint how much of the $200 \nmillion was for remediation costs, it cannot be plausibly inferred from the \nChancery Court Complaint's allegation about the Fayetteville Works consent \ndecree that Defendants misrepresented in any SEC report its maximum potential \nremediation liabilities. \nThe fifth and largest liability item discussed in the Chancery Court \nComplaint concerns a lawsuit brought by Carneys Point, a New Jersey \nmunicipality, to recover environmental remediation costs related to a former \n19 DuPont site called Chambers Works. Plaintiff alleges that an \"independent\" expert \nretained by Carneys Point had assessed the Chambers Works' remediation costs at \n$1.1 billion. D.I. 30 ,r,i 86-89. And it alleges that \"Chemours effectively admitted \nin the [Chancery Court] Complaint that the Carneys Point lawsuit was so \nmeritorious that [Chemours] was highly likely to actually incur the $1.1 billion \ncost .... \" D.I. 30 ,I 86. Chemours, however, made no such admission. Rather, \nChemours alleged in the Chancery Court Complaint that Carneys Point \"brought \nsuit against DuPont seeking over $1 billion to address alleged clean-up costs .... \" \nD.I. 42-1 ,I 92. Neither that allegation nor the fact that an expert hired by \nChemours' s litigation adversary assessed the Chambers Works site's remediation \ncosts at $1.1 billion implies in any way that Defendants believed that Chem ours' s \nmaximum potential remediation liabilities were $1.1 billion. \nThe last liability item discussed in the Chancery Court Complaint concerns \nfour New Jersey sites Chem ours inherited from DuPont. According to Plaintiff, \nChemours alleged in the Chancery Court Complaint that when DuPont provided it \nwith a $620 million estimate for remediation costs for those sites, \"it [was] evident \n(again) that the 'maximum' potential liability [was] not what DuPont certified it \nwas.\" D.I. 30 ,r 83 (alterations in original; underline removed). This is a fair \nsummary of Chemours's allegations in the Chancery Court Complaint; and a \nreasonable juror could plausibly infer from those allegations that Chemours \n20 believed at the time it filed the Chancery Court Complaint in May 2019 that its \nmaximum potential remediation liabilities for the four New Jersey sites in question \nwere more than $620 million. \nPlaintiff also alleges that Chem ours' s counsel told the Chancery Court that \nChemours had \"been objecting to the interpretation of [DuPont's] estimated \nliability maximums [for the four sites] for four years,\" D.I. 30 ,r 158 (emphasis \nremoved)-i.e., since the spin-off was consummated in 2015. This alleged \nstatement provides a plausible basis to infer that Defendants believed in 2018 that \nChemours's maximum liabilities for the four New Jersey sites exceeded $620 \nmillion. Accordingly, the $620 million estimate bears on the environmental \nremediation liability maximums disclosed in the 2018 Form 10-K, filed on \nFebruary 15, 2019, and the Ql 2019 Form 10-Q, filed May 3, 2019. D.I. 30 ,r,i \n235,243. Every maximum liability sum disclosed in those reports, however, \nexceeds $620 million. D.I. 30 ,r 113. It follows, then, that Chemours's allegations \nin the Chancery Court about DuPont's liability estimates for the four New Jersey \nsites are not by themselves sufficient to plausibly imply that Defendants falsely \nstated Chem ours' s maximum liabilities in the challenged SEC reports. \nIn summary, Chemours's allegations in the Chancery Court Complaint\u00ad\nindividually and collectively-do not plausibly imply that Defendants made false \n21 representations in the challenged SEC reports about Chemours's maximum \npotential environmental remediation liabilities. \n2) Kirsch 's Report and Presentations \nKirsch served as the President of Chem ours' s Fluoroproducts business from \nJune 2016 to October 2019. According to the Complaint, Kirsch \"conducted an \nexhaustive evaluation of total environmental remediation costs (not taking into \naccount potential related litigation) that would be required to clean up problematic \nsites Company-wide,\" and compiled a detailed report of his findings which he \npresented \"directly to [Vergnano and Newman] (and then the Chemours' board) \nstating that the Company's current environmental remediation costs would be $2 \nbillion.\" D.I. 30 ,r 129. The Complaint alleges that Kirsch began his analysis in \n\"early 2018\"; prepared the report \"in the spring of 2018\"-by which time \nVergnano and Newman \"were fully aware of the very high $2 billion expenditure \n[Kirsch] planned to recommend to the board\"; and presented his findings to \nChemours's board in \"August 2018.\" D.I. 30 ,r,r 130-31. The Complaint further \nalleges that \"Vergnano categorized these costs as coming from the 'capital budget,' \nand not environmental remediation accruals-meaning they would not have to be \ndisclosed as an environmental liability in the Company's public filings.\" D.I. 30 ,r \n132. \n22 A rational juror could plausibly infer from these alleged facts that, beginning \nin the Spring of 2018, Defendants believed that Chemours' s environmental \nremediation liabilities were approximately two billion dollars. That sum far \nexceeds the sum totals Chemours said its liabilities could range \"up to\" in each of \nthe challenged SEC reports. D.I. 30 ,I 113. Accordingly, Plaintiff has alleged false \nstatements about liability maximums in the five challenged reports filed beginning \nin the Spring of 2018 (i.e., beginning with Chemours' s Q 1 2018 Form 10-Q filed \non May 4, 2018). Kirsch's report and presentations, however, do not provide a \nfactual basis from which to infer that Defendants knew that their statements about \nliability maximums in the challenged SEC reports filed before the Spring of 2018 \nwere false. \nDefendants contend that Plaintiff has misstated the purpose and findings of \nKirsch' s report and presentations. And they submitted in support of their motion a \nsworn declaration in which Kirsch states that his report and presentations \"did not \nconcern environmental remediation obligations\" but instead \"were part of a \npublicly disclosed Corporate Responsibility Commitment program through which \nChemours hoped by 2030 to significantly reduce its environmental footprint and \ndemonstrate its leadership on environmental issues within the chemical industry.\" \nD.I. 42-10 at 1-2. Although Kirsch's declaration would be relevant to a motion to \nstrike pursuant to Rule 12( f), to impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, or for \n23 summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, the declaration presents matters outside \nthe pleadings, and, therefore, I will not consider it in assessing the merits of the \npending motion. Assuming, as I must at this stage, that the allegations in the \nComplaint are true, the alleged contents of Kirsch' s report and presentations \nplausibly imply that Defendants knew that their disclosures about the \nenvironmental liability maximums in the SEC reports filed after the Spring of 2018 \nwere false. (Indeed, Defendants admit as much in their briefing. See D.I. 35 at 38 \n(noting that \"the Complaint implies\" that Kirsch's presentation and its reported \ncontents constituted \"an analysis of Chem ours' s environmental remediation costs \nin the GAAP sense.\").) \nb. Whether The Alleged False Maximum Liability \nDisclosures are Inactionable Opinions or Fall Within \nthe PSLRA's Safe Harbor \nDefendants argue that \"[e]ven if Plaintiff had identified any error in \nChem ours' s environmental liability disclosures, they would nevertheless be \ninactionable because they were accurate statements of opinion.\" D.I. 35 at 25. \nStatements of opinion, however, are \"actionable under the securities laws if they \nare not honestly believed and lack a reasonable basis.\" City of Edinburgh Council \nv. Pfizer, Inc., 754 F.3d 159, 170 (3d Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). And for the \nreasons just noted, Plaintiff has alleged facts that plausibly imply that Defendants \ndid not believe that the maximum remediation liability disclosures in the five \n24 challenged SEC reports filed beginning in the Spring of 2018 were true. \nAccordingly, those disclosures do not constitute inactionable opinions. \nDefendants also argue that the challenged maximum liability statements are \nnot actionable because they are forward-looking and were accompanied by \nmeaningful cautionary statements and, therefore, are protected from suit by the \nPSLRA's so-called \"safe harbor\" codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(l). But\u00a7 78u-\n5(b)(2)(A) of the PSLRA provides that, with exceptions not applicable here, the \nsafe harbor \"shall not apply to a forward-looking statement that is included in a \nfinancial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples.\" The maximum remediation disclosures at issue here were included in \nthe challenged SEC reports' notes to financial statements, all of which were \nprepared in accordance with GAAP. D.I. 43-6 at 24; Chemours, Quarterly Report \n(Form 10-Q), at 30 (Aug. 3, 2018); Chemours, Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q), at \n30 (Nov. 2, 2018); D.I. 43-10 at F-46; D.I. 43-13 at 25. Consistent with SEC filing \nnorms, the challenged SEC reports repeatedly refer to the notes in question as \n\"notes to the financial statements.\" But the notes are undoubtedly part of the \nfinancial statements. See Disclosure Update and Simplification, 81 Fed. Reg. \n51,608, 51,623-26 (Aug. 4, 2016) (repeating seven times that \"disclosures in the \nnotes to the financial statements ... are not subject to safe harbor protections under \nthe PSLRA\"); Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8: Conceptual \n25 Framework for Financial Reporting, at 1-2, Fin. Accounting Standards Bd. (Dec. \n2021), \nhttps://www.fasb.org/jsp/F ASB/Document_ C/DocumentPage?cid=l 176179245223 \n( discussing importance of notes to financial statements); cf. United States v. \nDenedo, 556 U.S. 904, 921 (2009) (Roberts, C.J.) (concurring) (noting that \n\"footnotes are part of an opinion\"). Indeed, Defendants themselves expressly \nstated in the two most recent challenged SEC reports that the \"notes are an integral \npart of [Chemours's] ... financial statements.\" D.I. 43-10 at F-10; D.I. 43-13 at 7. \nAccordingly, the disclosures set forth in the notes to the financial statements are \nexcluded from safe-harbor protection under \u00a7 78u-5(b )(2)(A). \nFinally, Defendants argue that\u00a7 78u-5(b)(2)(A)'s \"exclusion should not \napply here because the remediation disclosures were also made, nearly verbatim, in \nthe Management's Discussion and Analysis ('MD&A') section\" of the challenged \nSEC reports. D.I. 56 at 2. Defendants cite no case law to support this proposition, \nand I can understand why. Were courts to adopt this line of reasoning, parties \ncould avoid\u00a7 78u-5(b)(2)(A)'s exclusion simply by repeating the entirety of their \nfinancial statements in the MD&A sections of their SEC reports. That would \nrender \u00a7 78u-5(b )(2)(A) nugatory. \n26 In sum, Defendants' alleged false disclosures about environmental liability \nmaximums in the challenged SEC reports filed after the Spring of 2018 are neither \ninactionable opinion nor immunized from suit under the PSLRA's safe harbor. \n2. Statements About The Estimableness of Certain Liabilities \nPlaintiff alleges in 12 paragraphs of the Complaint that Defendants falsely \nstated in the challenged SEC reports that \"a range of losses\" for Chem ours' s \nbenzene-related liabilities \"cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\" D.I. 30 ,r,r \n108, 172, 173, 182, 192,198,209,215,222,229,240,248. Plaintiff argues that a \njuror could plausibly infer that Defendants knew these statements were false from \nChemours's \"admi[ssion] [in the Chancery Court Complaint] that DuPont had \ngiven it a detailed 'comprehensive study' specifically quantifying its inherited \nbenzene litigation as amounting to no less than $111 million .... \" DJ. 30 ,r I 04. \nThe problem with this argument is that Chemours alleged in the Chancery Court \nComplaint that the DuPont study had estimated that the maximum potential \nbenzene liabilities were at least $111 million. DJ. 30 ,r 106. As Plaintiff \nacknowledges in the Complaint, GAAP requires disclosure only of probable and \nreasonably possible liabilities. See D.I. 30 ,r,r 257, 259-60. The fact that \nChemours was aware of or even agreed with DuPont's estimate of the maximum \npossible benzene liabilities does not imply that Chemours could reasonably \n27 estimate a range of the probable or reasonably possible losses it could incur from \nits inherited benzene liabilities. \nI also agree with Defendants that their statements about the estimableness of \nthe benzene-related losses are inactionable opinions. D.I. 35 at 25. Defendants' \npossession or adoption of DuPont's maximum liability estimate does not support \nPlaintiffs' conclusory allegation that Defendants did not honestly believe they were \nincapable of estimating a likely range of benzene liabilities. \nPlaintiff also alleges in paragraph 250 of the Complaint that Chem ours \n\"false[ly] and misleading[ly]\" stated in its Ql 2019 Form 10-Q that its \"liabilities \nrelating\" to \"several lawsuits filed by the NJ DEP in March 2019\" were \"not \nestimable.\" D.I. 30 ,I 250. According to the Complaint, Defendants \"admitted\" in \nthe Chancery Court Complaint that \"Chemours was aware of estimates by DuPont \nthat its environmental liabilities in New Jersey would be approximately $620 \nmillion\" and that \"New Jersey's lawsuits threatened [Chemours] with 'staggeringly \nexpensive' costs well into the 'hundreds of millions of dollars.\"' D.I. 30 ,I 250. \nBut here is what Chemours actually \"admitted\" in the Chancery Court \nComplaint with respect to ongoing lawsuits in New Jersey: \nRecently, the State of New Jersey has instituted litigation \nconcerning environmental liabilities arising from \nDuPont's historical activities there. In March 2019, New \nJersey filed several lawsuits against DuPont and \nChemours, warning that the costs of compensating the \nState for DuPont's legacy environmental liabilities across \n28 multiple sites in the State could be \"staggeringly \nexpensive,\" and seeking compensatory and punitive \ndamages. At the time of the spin-off, DuPont certified \nthat the \"maximum\" Chemours could have to pay for \ntotal New Jersey environmental liabilities was $337 \nmillion, divided among different sites in the State. In \n2018, in connection with the DowDuPont spin-off, \nDuPont revised its liability estimate upward to \napproximately $620 million. But New Jersey criticized \neven DuPont's upward-revised estimates, claiming it \n\"implausible\" that these amounts could represent \"good\u00ad\nfaith estimates of [DuPont's historical New Jersey] \nenvironmental obligations and liabilities.\" Although \nChemours is defending against New Jersey's claims and \nthe matters are in their early stages, it is evident (again) \nthat the \"maximum\" potential liability is not what \nDuPont certified it was. \nD.I. 42-1 ,I 88. None of these assertions plausibly imply that Chemours falsely \nstated in its first quarter 10-Q for 2019 that its liabilities relating to the lawsuits \nfiled by New Jersey were not estimable. A reasonable investor would not infer \nfrom New Jersey's \"wam[ings]\" to DuPont and Chemours about their potential \nliabilities in those suits that Chemours could estimate those liabilities; nor would a \nreasonable investor infer from Chem ours' s assertion that DuPont had understated \nthe \"maximum potential liability\" for those suits that Chemours was in a position \nto estimate the actual outcome of and liabilities associated with the lawsuits. \nI also agree with Defendants that these \"environmental liability disclosures\" \nare inactionable statements of opinion. D.I. 35 at 25. The fact that Defendants \nknew of or even adopted DuPont's maximum liability estimates provides no \n29 plausible basis on which to assert that Chemours did not honestly believe that it \nlacked sufficient information to adequately estimate its likely New Jersey liabilities \nor that such an assertion lacked a reasonable basis. \nAccordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs claims are based on allegations that \nDefendants were not able to estimate Chem ours' s liabilities, I will dismiss them. \n3. Statements That Certain Liabilities Had No Impact \nAccording to Plaintiff, the Complaint alleges that Defendants falsely stated \nin each of the ten challenged SEC reports \"that ' [ m ]anagement does not believe \nthat any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities in any \nindividual site will have a material impact on [Chemours' s] financial position.\"' \nD.I. 37 at 23 (citing D.I. 30 ,r,r 169, 179, 189, 195,206,212,219,224,235,243) \n(first alteration in the original). Plaintiff argues that allegations in the Complaint \nabout Chemours' s potential financial exposure for remediation costs and litigation \nliability provide \"details\" of how \"these statements were materially false and \nmisleading when made.\" D.I. 37 at 23. For example, Plaintiff alleges that, \"[i]n \nthe [Chancery Court] Complaint, Defendants admitted that they were \nunequivocally told by DuPont prior to the Class Period that remediation costs for \nChemours'[s] New Jersey sites alone would be $337 million, and during the Class \nPeriod, $620 million-highly material amounts that constituted 34% and 62%, \n30 respectively, of the Company's annual net income.\" D.I. 30 ,I 171 (emphasis \nremoved). \nThis argument is based on truncated and misleading quoting from the \nComplaint ( and the SEC reports). The Complaint in fact alleges that Defendants \nfalsely stated that \"[m]anagement does not believe that any loss, in excess of \namounts accrued, related to remediation activities in any individual site will have a \nmaterial impact on [Chemours's] financial position, results of operations or cash \nflows at any given year, as such obligation can be satisfied or settled over many \nyears.\" D.I. 30 ,I 169-70 (underline in the original) (italics added) (first alteration \nin original); see also D.I. 30 ,I,I 179-80, 189-90, 195-96, 206-07, 212-13, 219-20, \n224-25, 235-36, 243-44. Thus, in the New Jersey example above, the $337 or \n$620 million were total values for liability, not liabilities Chemours would need to \nincur \"at any given year .... \" As Plaintiff identifies no factual allegations in the \nComplaint from which it could be plausibly inferred that this statement was false, I \nwill dismiss Plaintiffs' claims to the extent they are based on this statement. \nDefendants also assert-and I agree-that these accounting judgments are \ninactionable opinions. D.I. 35 at 25-26. The statements about the materiality of \nthe impact of any individual site were included in GAAP filings and clearly reflect \nan accounting judgment. They are therefore opinions. See In re Hertz Glob. \nHoldings, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2017 WL 1536223, at *11 (D.N.J. Apr. 27, 2017) \n31 (\"GAAP standards are often subjective. They involve a range of possible \ntreatments instead of a single objective set of calculations.\"), affd sub nom. Hertz \nGlob. Holdings, 905 F.3d 106. Plaintiffs factual allegations provide no plausible \nbasis for alleging that Defendants' statements were not \"honestly believed\" or that \nthey lacked a \"reasonable basis\" because knowing maximum potential total \nliabilities provides no basis for estimating likely liabilities in any particular year. \nThe accounting judgments' status as an inactionable opinion provides another, \nindependent ground to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims to the extent they are based on \nthose judgments. \nThe Complaint also alleges that, in Chem ours' s 10-Qs filed in November \n2018 and May 2019 and its 10-K for 2018 filed in February 2019, Defendants \nfalsely stated that \"while management believes it is reasonably possible that \nChem ours could incur losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for\" PFOA and \nPF AS litigation for which Chemours was obligated to indemnify DuPont, \"it does \nnot believe any such loss would have a material impact on the Company's \nconsolidated financial position, results of operation, or cash flows.\" D.I. 3011 \n227-28, 238-39, 246-47 (underline in one of the originals). Plaintiff argues that \nthe Complaint plausibly implies that these statements were false because it alleges \nthat \n[ a ]!though in its public filings Chemours had never \naccrued more than $101 million in remediation costs for \n32 four highly polluted New Jersey sites, the [Chancery \nCourt Complaint] admitted that DuPont told Defendants \nbefore the Class Period that the maximum remediation \ncosts for these sites could be $33 7 million; Chem ours \nwas informed during the Class Period that these costs \nwould be $620 million-an amount which the [Chancery \nCourt Complaint] noted was \"implausibly\" low; and an \nexpert using Chem ours' [ s] own documents estimated the \nliability at $1.1 billion for just one of those sites. \nD.I. 37 (citing D.I. 30 ,r,r 81-89, 111-112) (emphases in original). \nBut none of these allegations plausibly imply that Chem ours believed any \nloss for PFOA and PF AS litigation liabilities beyond any accrued loss would have \na material impact on the Chemours' s consolidated financial position, results of \noperation, or cash flows; and, thus, none of these allegations plausibly imply that \nDefendants made false statements in Chemours' s 10-Qs filed in November 2018 \nand May 2019 or its 10-K for 2018 filed in February 2019. First, Chemours did \nnot \"admit\" in the Chancery Court Complaint that DuPont ( or anyone else) \ninformed it that remediation costs for the New Jersey sites \"would be\" $620 \nmillion. Rather, the Chancery Court Complaint alleges that DuPont revised the \ninitial maximum liability estimate of $33 7 million it provided before the spin-off \nupwards to $620 million in 2018. D.I. 42-1 ,r 88. In other words, DuPont told \nChemours that, in DuPont's estimation, remediation liability could be up to $620 \nmillion. \"Would be\" and \"could be\" are of course two completely different things. \nDuPont's estimates of potential maximum liabilities, alone, have no bearing on \n33 whether Chemours believed the liability would affect its financial position. \nSecond, saying the Chancery Court Complaint \"noted\" that $620 million was an \n\"implausibly low\" amount is misleading. The Chancery Complaint expressly \nstates that New Jersey-i.e., the plaintiff that sued Chemours and DuPont\u00ad\nclaimed that $337 million and $620 million were \"implausible.\" Third, as the \nComplaint itself acknowledges, the alleged expert who estimated the liability of \none of the New Jersey sites at $1.1 billion was employed by the New Jersey \nmunicipality that filed the suit against DuPont and Chemours. \nThe challenged statements concerning materiality are also opinions, and \nPlaintiff has not plausibly alleged that Defendants did not honestly believe them or \nlacked a reasonable basis to assert them. As discussed above, Defendants' \nknowledge of Chem ours' s maximum possible liabilities does not demonstrate that \nthey knew of or could estimate its likely liabilities. \nAccordingly, I will dismiss Plaintifrs claims to the extent that they are \nbased on allegations that Defendants falsely stated that any loss for PFOA and \nPF AS litigation liabilities, beyond any accrued loss, would have no material impact \non Chem ours' s consolidated financial position, results of operation, or cash flows. \n4. Statements about \"Financial Strength\" \nPlaintiff argues that the Complaint alleges that Defendants made numerous \nfalse statements \"to project a fa9ade of financial strength through additional plain \n34 language assurances to investors.\" D.I. 37 at 24. They point, for example, to \nallegations that Defendants falsely and \"repeatedly promoted a 'strong,' 'solid' and \n'de-risked' balance sheet ... and touted a complete 'transformation' along with a \nhigher credit profile.\" D.I. 37 at 24 (citations omitted); see also D.I. 30 ,r,r 165, \n168, 193, 201, 203, 205, 207, 218, 230, 231-32, 233-34, 236 (making similar \nallegations). But these general statements of optimism are pure puffery and \"too \nvague to be actionable.\" In re Aetna, Inc. Sec. Litig., 617 F.3d 272, 283 (3d Cir. \n2010) (internal quotations and citations omitted). They are also immaterial, as no \nreasonable investor would rely upon such platitudes or \"consider [them] important \nin deciding how to [act].\" Aetna, 617 F.3d at 283 (second alteration in original) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted). \nPlaintiff also cites allegations in the Complaint that Defendants falsely \n\"claimed to have achieved their 'key target' of dramatically lowering \nChemours'[s] 'net leverage ratio,\"' D.I. 37 at 24, that Vergnano falsely stated in \npublic that \"Chemours had been in '[n]o way' 'set up to fail,\"' D.I. 37 at 25 \n( alterations in the original); and that Vergnano falsely stated during a television \ninterview in March 2017 that \"Chemours'[s] [PFOA] liability was 'behind us,\"' \nD.I. 37 at 24.4 But Plaintiffs allegations that these statements are false tum on \n4 Plaintiff argues in its brief that Vergnano stated that Chem ours' s \"PF AS \nliabilities\" were \"behind us,\" D.I. 37 at 25, but the Complaint alleges that \n35 its allegation that Chemours admitted in the Chancery Court Complaint that it \nwas insolvent at the time of its formation. See D.I. 30 ,r 180 (alleging that \"the \nCompany had not 'reached our goal' of reducing its net leverage ratio to below \n3x because of its 'transformation plan,' nor had it achieved 'balance sheet \nflexibility.' Rather, as Defendants have now admitted in the [Chancery Court] \nComplaint, Chem ours' [ s] environmental remediation and litigation liabilities \nwere so massive, amounting to over $2.46 billion, that they far outweighed the \nCompany's net assets and rendered it insolvent as a matter of law from the time \nof the spin-off and throughout the Class Period.\" (underlines in original)); D.I. \n30 ,r 232 (alleging that \"Vergnano's staunch denial that 'no way' had Chemours \nbeen 'set up to fail' is directly contradicted by Chem ours' [ s] admission in the \n[Chancery Court] Complaint that Chemours was indeed set up to fail ... \n[because] DuPont had rendered Chemours insolvent in violation of Delaware \nlaw\"); D.I. 30 ,r 176 (alleging, \"in direct contrast to Vergnano's repeated \nstatements, that the Company's environmental liabilities were not 'behind us,' .. \n. [because] Defendants admitted in the [Chancery Court] Complaint that the \nCompany's environmental remediation and litigation liabilities amount to \nover $2.46 billion, a staggering amount that rendered the Company insolvent \nVergnano stated that Chemours's PFOA liabilities were \"behind us,\" D.I. 30 ,r,r 77, \n174-76. \n36 as a matter of law from the time of the spin-off through the Class Period\" \n(underline in the original)). Chemours, however, did not admit in the Chancery \nCourt Complaint that it was or had been insolvent. Rather, it alleged that if \nDuPont's certified maximum liabilities did not cap Chemours' s indemnification \nand contribution obligations, then Chemours would have been insolvent at the \ntime of its spin-off. D.I. 42-1 ,I,I 10, 107, 123. And, since the spin-off could \nhave occurred under Delaware law only if Chemours had not been insolvent, \nChemours sought a declaration from the Court of Chancery that DuPont was \nbound by the certified maximums and not entitled to indemnification or \ncontribution from Chemours beyond those maximums. D.I. 42-1 ,I,I 102-10. \nPlaintiff alleges that Vergnano' s statement that Chem ours' s PFOA liability \nwas \"behind us\" \"was false for the additional reason that, as Defendants well \nknew, the Ohio MDL settlement resolved only a fraction of the Company's \nmassive environmental liabilities.\" D.I. 30 ,I 176. But this allegation about the \nOhio MDL settlement does not plausibly imply a false statement for two reasons. \nFirst, the settlement in question allegedly covered only 3,500 out of 70,000 \npotential cases. D.I. 30 ,I 77, 176. Plaintiff does not, however, allege any facts that \nclaims from individuals beyond those 3,500 were probable as of March 2017, \nwhen Vergnano made the challenged statement. Quite the contrary, the Complaint \nalleges that the Ohio MDL included only 3,500 individuals because a \"Science \n37 Panel\" determined in 2012 that \"there were 'probable links' between PFOA \nexposure and six serious diseases,\" and only \"3,500 individuals c[a]m[e] forward \nas having been diagnosed with one of the six diseases due to PFOA exposure from \nWashington Works .... \" D.I. 30 ,I 36. Thus, by the Plaintiffs' own telling, the \n3,500 individuals who came forward were the 3,500 individuals to whom \nChemours likely had liabilities. \nSecond, Plaintiff alleges that \"personal injury cases arising from PFOA \nexposure at Washington Works [(a site Chemours inherited from DuPont)] \nincreased tenfold from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018\" with \nsome of the cases seeking high damages amounts due to \"the same type of PFOA \nexposure as in the Ohio MDL litigation .... \" D.I. 30 ,I 78, 282. But Vergnano \nmade his \"behind us\" statement in March 2017-i.e., before the third quarter of \n2017. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable investor would \nplausibly have understood Vergnano' s statement to be false at the time he spoke. \nVergnano's \"behind us\" statement is inactionable for two additional reasons. \nFirst, it is too vague for a reasonable investor to rely on and is therefore \nimmaterial. Second, whether a liability is \"behind\" an organization is a subjective \njudgment made based on particular facts and circumstances, and, since the \nComplaint alleges no facts to infer that Defendants knew or should have known at \n38 the time Vergnano made the \"behind us\" statements that the statements were false, \nVergnano 's judgment is an inactionable statement of opinion. \nFor these reasons, to the extent Plaintiffs claims are based on Defendants' \nstatements about Chem ours' s financial strength, I will dismiss them. \n5. Financial Disclosures Inconsistent with GAAP \nIt is undisputed that GAAP requires accrual of a contingent loss if the loss is \ndeemed \"probable\" and \"reasonably estimable\" and that GAAP requires disclosure \nof a \"reasonably possible\" contingent loss. D.I. 37 at 28; D.I. 35 at 7. Plaintiff \nalleges in broad terms that Defendants' accruals and disclosures with respect to \n\"aggregate environmental remediation and litigation,\" the Chambers Works site, \nand Chemours's PFOA-related litigation violated these requirements. D.I. 37 at \n28. In Plaintiffs words: \"[A]ll record evidence indicates Defendants' accruals and \nrelated disclosures were grossly inadequate.\" D.I. 37 at 29. The \"evidence\" \nPlaintiff points to in support of this assertion consists only of Chem ours' s \nallegations in the Chancery Court Complaint that it inherited from DuPont \nmaximum potential liabilities of $2.5 billion in the aggregate and $620 million for \nfour New Jersey sites and that an expert retained by Chem ours' s adversary in the \nCarneys Point litigation opined that the remediation liability for the Chambers \nWorks site was $1.1 billion. See D.I. 3 7 at 29-32. A rational juror, however, \ncould not plausibly infer from these allegations that Chemours' s contingent losses \n39 for its aggregate environmental remediation and litigation, Chambers Works, and \nPFOA-related litigation were probable, reasonably possible, or reasonably \nestimable. \nPlaintiff also argues that the challenged SEC reports' accruals for losses \nrelated to the Fayetteville Works site violated GAAP. D.I. 30 ,r,r 102, 273-275.5 \nAccording to Plaintiff: \nDefendants knew from the start of the Class Period that \nChemours'[s] probable and estimable remediation \nexpenses would be far more substantial than the \nCompany represented. As the [Chancery Court] \nComplaint alleges, DuPont spent just $2.3 million \nremediating at the Fayetteville Works site prior to the \nspin-off, despite a Blue Ribbon Panel concluding that \n$60 million in required costs were required to end the \nsubject discharges. See ,r,r90-92. Even after Chemours \nsigned a consent order with the State of North Carolina in \nFebruary 2019, pursuant to which Chemours was \nadmittedly required to spend \"at least $200 million\" in \nremediation costs, Defendants failed to report this cost in \nthe Company's financial statements. It was not until \nChemours'[s] Q4 2019 Form 10-Q, filed after the Class \nPeriod, that Chemours belatedly recognized a \nFayetteville Works remediation accrual of $201 million \n5 Plaintiff argues in its brief that \"Defendants never even disclosed, let alone \naccrued, the $200 million [ for Fayetteville Works remediation] through the Class \nPeriod end.\" D.I. 37 at 29 ( citing D.I. 30 ,r 275). But the Complaint does not \nallege a failure to disclose. Plaintiff alleges in paragraph 275 of the Complaint that \n\"Chemours did not disclose any specific accrual until the Q3 2018 Form 10-Q,\" \nbut failure to \"disclose\" an \"accrual\" alleges a failure to accrue, not a failure to \ndisclose. \n40 D.I. 30 ,r 275. \nThat Defendants were aware that the cost of implementing measures to \nprevent future discharges into the Cape Fear River would be $60 million, D.I. 30 ,r \n93, provides no evidence that Chemours had a probable liability, much less that \nany loss was reasonably estimable. Plaintiff alleges that Vergnano knew of the \nBlue Ribbon Panel's recommendation before the Class Period, D.I. 30 ,r 95; that a \nDuPont executive testified that Defendants knew \" [ some ]thing\" about the \nFayetteville liabilities before 2015, D.I. 30 ,r 96; that Chemours argued in a June \n15, 2017 meeting with North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality that \nChem ours' s emissions were permissible and that it had attempted to abate such \nemissions, D.I. 30 ,r,r 98-100; and that Confidential Witness 1 said Defendants \nfailed to follow the Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendation because Chemours was \nmyopically focused on short-term profit, D.I. 30 ,r 101. These alleged facts, \nhowever, do not plausibly imply that Defendants knew it was probable that \nChemours would face liabilities arising from the Fayetteville Works site or that \nChemours could reasonably estimate what those liabilities were. \nDefendants admitted in the Chancery Court Complaint that the consent \ndecree required \"among other things\" that Chemours \"adopt ... abatement \ntechnology that DuPont previously declined to install and to undertake extensive \nremediation regarding the cumulative effects of DuPont's long-running historical \n41 emissions.\" D.I. 42-1 ,r 86. They further admitted that the cost to implement the \nconsent decree \"will be in excess of $200 million.\" D.I. 42-1 ,r 86 (emphasis \nadded). But it does not follow from these admissions that Chemours should have \naccrued $200 million in the first quarter of 2019. Under GAAP, the requirement \nthat a loss must be probable to be accrued \"is intended to proscribe accrual of \nlosses that relate to future periods.\" Accounting Standards Codification \u00a7 450-20-\n25-3, Fin. Standards Accounting Board (Accessed Feb. 24, 2022), \nhttps://asc.fasb.org/section&trid 2127173; D.I. 42-3 at 18. Chemours's belief in \nthe first quarter of 2019 that the total cost to implement all the consent decree's \nrequirements over time would eventually exceed $200 million did not mean that \nChemours had to accrue $200 million in the first quarter of 2019. Chemours in \nfact accrued $83 million for the consent decree in its Q 1 2019 Form 10-Q, $58 \nmillion of which was accrued as litigation costs. D.I. 43-13 at 24.6 Plaintiff points \nto no alleged facts that plausibly imply that Defendants did not honestly believe \nthat this accrual (which is an opinion) was adequate or that it lacked a reasonable \nbasis. (In its 2019 Form 10-K, Chemours accrued \"$201 million[] for costs of the \nproposed Consent Order\" associated with \"remediation\" and \"toxicology studies.\" \nD.I. 43-18 at 50.) \n6 Chemours's 2018 10-K, dated February 15, 2019, disclosed a \"proposed Consent \nOrder\" with North Carolina for which it \"accrued\" $75 million. D.I. 43-10 at 34. \n42 Thus, to the extent any allegations in the Complaint are based upon financial \naccruals and disclosures inconsistent with GAAP, I will dismiss them. \n* * * * \nIn summary, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants falsely stated in \nChemours's Ql, Q2, and Q3 2018 Form 10-Qs, 2018 Form 10-K, and Ql 2019 \nForm 10-Q that Chem ours' s liabilities would only be \"up to\" between $7 63 and \n$780 million. D.I. 30 ,r,r 113,213,220,225,236,244. The Complaint's \nallegations about the content and sharing of Kirsch' s report and presentations-all \nof which I must assume to be true-plausibly imply that Defendants knew at the \ntime these five SEC reports were filed that Chem ours' s remediation liabilities \nexceeded $2 billion and that, therefore, Defendants' disclosures about maximum \nremediation liabilities were false. D.I. 30 ,r,r 127-33. The safe harbor does not \nprotect Defendants' false statements because, even if Defendants provided \nadequate cautionary language, Defendants' statements were included in financial \nstatements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(b )(2)(A); D.I. \n43-6 at 24; Chemours, Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q), at 30 (Aug. 3, 2018); \nChemours, Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q), at 30 (Nov. 2, 2018); D.I. 43-10 at F-\n46; D.I. 43-13 at 25. To the extent Plaintifrs claims are based on any other alleged \nfalse statements, I will dismiss them. Thus, I evaluate scienter and loss causation \n43 only with respect to Defendants' alleged false statements about maximum \nremediation liabilities. \nB. Scienter \nIn order to plead a securities fraud claim, a plaintiff must \"state with \nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the \nrequired state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)(A). To plead that required state \nof mind-i.e., scienter-the plaintiff must allege facts from which it can be \nplausibly inferred that the defendant acted with an \"intent to deceive, manipulate, \nor defraud\" with \"a knowing or reckless state of mind.\" Avaya, 564 F.3d at 252. \nThe \"inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable-it \nmust be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of \nnonfraudulent intent.\" Tellabs, 5 51 U.S. at 314. \nThe alleged facts here make reckless or conscious fraud on the part of the \nDefendants as plausible as any opposing inference. Plaintiff alleges that \nDefendants were aware in the Spring of2018 that Kirsch's report and presentations \nestimated environmental remediation liabilities of $2 billion but represented in five \ncontemporaneous SEC reports that Chemours' s potential exposure for \nenvironmental remediation would only be \"up to\" $763 to $780 million. D.I. 30 ,I \n113; see, e.g., D.I. 43-10 at F-46. Thus, accepting as true the allegations in the \nComplaint, on five occasions Defendants knowingly made false statements about \n44 Chem ours' s maximum remediation liabilities. Those statements, when considered \nin light of Defendants' awareness of the Kirsch report and presentations, were \nconscious acts of fraud sufficient to show scienter. See Alaska Electrical Pension \nFund v. Pharmacia Corp., 554 F.3d 342, 351-52 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Tellabs, \n551 U.S. at 313) (finding that a pharmaceutical company's alleged \"bad faith \nmisrepresentation of scientific data\" was sufficient to show sci enter); see also In re \nAdvance Auto Parts, Inc., Sec. Litig., 2020 WL 599543, at *8 (D. Del. Feb. 7, \n2020) (noting that \"[ c ]ourts regularly draw an inference of scienter where \n'Defendants had access to internal forecasts and the company's financial data' \nindicating\" the falsity of the company's disclosures). \nThe question, then is whether there is more plausible, nonculpable \nexplanation for Defendants' statements. Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 314; Hertz Glob. \nHoldings, 905 F.3d at 115 (upholding the district court's consideration of \ninferences favorable to the defendant when evaluating nonculpable alternatives). \nAnd here, again, relying on Kirsch' s declaration, Defendants argue that Kirsch' s \nreport and presentations concerned general corporate responsibility commitments \nto \"achieve a range of goals that far exceed[ed] regulatory requirements,\" rather \nthan environmental remediation liabilities. D.I. 35 at 38. But, as the Supreme \nCourt held in Tellabs, the test is whether \"a reasonable person would deem the \ninference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference \n45 one could draw from the facts alleged.\" 551 U.S. at 324 (emphasis added). Thus, I \nmust rely only on the factual allegations in the Complaint and may not consider the \nKirsch declaration. \nDefendants argue that their nonculpable explanation for Defendants' false \nstatements about maximum remediation liabilities can be inferred from the \nfollowing allegations in the Complaint: Kirsch began his investigation after \nChem ours \"realized by doing the bare minimum it had exposed itself to significant \nliabilities[,]\" D.I. 30 ,r 129; Kirsch was evaluating \"how much it would cost to \n'plug all the holes' at each Chemours worksite and remediate the damage already \ndone to the environment[,]\" D.I. 30 ,r 130; and Vergnano \"categorized these costs \nas coming from the 'capital budget,\"' D.I. 30 ,r 132. But even if these facts \nplausibly imply that Kirsch was examining the cost of capital investments required \nto remediate environmental damage that Chemours was not under a present \nobligation to remediate, that inference is not more plausible or cogent than \nPlaintiffs allegation that Kirsch prepared and shared with Defendants \"a detailed \nreport tallying [Chemours's] remediation liabilities[,]\" D.I. 30 ,r 130, and that \nDefendants' false statements were made consciously and to deceive investors. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded sci enter with regard to the \nmaximum environmental remediation liabilities stated in the five most recent \nchallenged SEC reports. \n46 C. Loss Causation \nUnder the PSLRA, \u00b7 the plaintiff has \"the burden of proving that the act or \nomission of the defendant ... caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to \nrecover damages.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4). \"The loss causation inquiry asks \nwhether the misrepresentation or omission proximately caused the economic loss.\" \nMcCabe v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 494 F.3d 418,426 (3d Cir. 2007). In cases such \nas this one, where the plaintiff alleges that a defendant's misrepresentation caused \nit losses in the form of reduced value of its stock, the plaintiff \"must show that the \nrevelation of that misrepresentation ... was a substantial factor in causing a \ndecline in the security's price .... \" Id. at 425-26. Plaintiff argues that the \nComplaint in this action meets this showing because it identifies three \"corrective \ndisclosures\" \"that each indisputably concerned the same subject matter as \nDefendants' false statements and caused immediate stock sell-offs and investor \nlosses.\" D.I. 37 at 49. \nThe first corrective disclosure alleged in the Complaint is a presentation \nmade by a hedge fund CEO at an investment conference on Monday, May 6, 2019. \nAccording to the Complaint, the CEO gave a \"detailed presentation\" during which \nhe revealed previously undisclosed information\" that showed that \"Chemours \nfaced '$4 to $6 billion' in environmental liabilities.\" D.I. 30 ,r,r 136-137 \n(underline omitted). The Complaint alleges that \"[o]n this news, Chemours'[s] \n47 stock price plummeted over two trading days from $34.18 per share on Friday, \nMay 3, 2019 to $29.09 per share on Tuesday, May 7, 2019-a decline of nearly \n15% that wiped out over $830 million in [Chemours's] market capitalization.\" D.I. \n301138. \nDefendants contend that the CEO's presentation \"cannot be probative of loss \ncausation\" because it did not \"impart[] any 'new information' related to the \nalleged fraud\" and because \"the purported share price 'reaction' to the presentation \nhad started days earlier, after a disappointing earnings release.\" D.I. 35 at 41. But \nboth contentions are easily dismissed. First, the Complaint expressly alleges that \nthe presentation revealed \"previously undisclosed information\" that showed that \nChemours environmental liabilities exceeded $4 billion, and I must accept this \nallegation as true for purposes of deciding the pending motion. Second, even if it \nwere the case that Chem ours' s stock price decreased days before the CEO' s \npresentation, the Complaint alleges that the stock price fell significantly and \nimmediately after the presentation. That allegation allows for a plausible inference \nthat the presentation precipitated the 15% drop in the stock price; and whether the \nunidentified \"disappointing earnings release\" contributed to that drop or was the \nreal cause for the drop is a matter for the jury to decide. Thus, Plaintiff has \n48 adequately alleged loss causation based on the alleged May 6, 2019, corrective \ndisclosure. 7 \nThe same cannot be said with respect to the second and third alleged \ncorrective disclosures. The Complaint identifies the unsealing of the Chancery \nCourt Complaint as the second corrective disclosure. The Complaint alleges that \nthe Chancery Court Complaint contained previously undisclosed information about \nChem ours' s environmental liabilities that contradicted Chem ours' s prior \nmisrepresentations, and it alleges that the unsealing of the Chancery Court \nComplaint on June 28, 2019, resulted in another 15% decline in the price of \nChemours's stock. D.I. 30 ,r,r 141-142, 145,288. But as discussed above, the \nallegations in the Chancery Court Complaint do not plausibly imply that \nDefendants made any false representations. Accordingly, the public disclosure of \nthe Chancery Court Complaint could not establish that Plaintiff suffered losses \ncaused by Defendants' alleged false representations. \n7 The parties dispute the standard I should apply to determine whether the \nComplaint adequately pleads loss causation. Defendants argue that I should \n\"follow the weight of authority\" and apply the heightened requirements of Rule \n9(b). D.I. 38 at 16 n.9. Plaintiff argues that \"Rule 8(a) applies to loss causation.\" \nD.I. 37 at 48. The Third Circuit has not resolved this question, and I need not \ndecide it here because the Complaint identifies the \"who, what, when, where, and \nhow\" of the corrective disclosure and plausibly links it and Defendants' alleged \nmisrepresentations with a significant drop in Chem ours' s stock price. It therefore \nprovides sufficient detail of alleged loss causation to satisfy Rule 9(b ). \n49 Plaintiff identifies as the third corrective disclosure public statements by \nChemours on August 1, 2019, that \"disappointing financial results and increased \nliabilities,\" D.I. 30 ,r 289, caused Chemours to \"dramatically reduc[e] its full-year \nfree cash flow outlook from prior guidance of over $550 million to only $100 \nmillion-indicating that, rather than a 'strong,' 'solid,' or 'flexible' balance sheet \nwith ample room to deal with future liabilities, in reality [Chemours] had virtually \nno liquidity cushion to speak of,\" D.I. 30 ,r 148. This disclosure, however, says \nnothing about Chem ours' s maximum environmental remediation liabilities, and \ntherefore, it can't be said to \"correct\" or reveal the falsity of Defendants' alleged \nmisrepresentations about those liabilities. Accordingly, it can't serve as evidence \nthat the alleged false representations about environmental remediation liabilities \ncaused Plaintiff to suffer losses. \nD. Section 20(a) \nBecause I find that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded its claim for the \nunderlying \u00a7 1 0(b) securities fraud, I also find that it has adequately pleaded its \nclaims against Vergnano and Newman for violations of\u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange \nAct. Plaintiff alleges that Vergnano is Chem ours' s President and CEO and that \nNewman is Chemours's Senior Vice President and COO and was previously its \nCFO. D.I. 30 ,r,r 20, 22. Plaintiff alleges that both men \"reviewed, approved, \nsigned and certified Chem ours' [ s] quarterly and annual filings with the SEC on \n50 Forms 10-Q and 10-K\" throughout the Class Period; that they \"had the power and \ninfluence to cause [Chemours] to engage in the unlawful conduct complained of \n[in the Complaint]\"; and \"did, directly or indirectly, control the conduct of \nChemours's business.\" D.I. 30 ,r,r 21, 23, 27. Since Plaintiff adequately alleges \nthat Chemours falsely understated its maximum potential environmental \nremediation liabilities in the five most recent challenged SEC reports-and since \nPlaintiff adequately alleges that Vergnano and Newman knew the maximum \nliability amounts were false at the time they signed those SEC reports-Plaintiff \nhas plausibly alleged that Vergnano and Newman are controlling persons who \nculpably participated in Chemours' s violations of Section 1 0(b ). See Belmont, 708 \nF.3d at 484. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, I will grant in part and deny in part Defendants' \nmotion to dismiss. I will allow the claims to proceed insofar as they are based on \nthe Complaint's allegations regarding the contents of the Kirsch report and \npresentations and the alleged false representations about Chem ours' s maximum \nenvironmental remediation liabilities in the five most recent SEC reports filed \nduring the Class Period. I will dismiss the claims in all other respects. \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n51 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIn re The Chemours Company \nSecurities Litigation Civil Action No. 19-1911-CFC \nCLASS ACTION \nORDER \nAt Wilmington on this Twenty-fourth day of February in 2022: \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this day, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class \nAction Complaint (D.1. 34) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART: \n1.
