No. 17 -1870- RGA  \n: \nTC ELECTRIC CO. ,    : \n: \nDefendant .  : \n \n MEMORANDUM  OPINION  \nDarnell H. Fullman, Sr., Bear , Delaware.  Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n \nJustin Callaway, Esqui re, Esquire, Salmon R icchezza S inger & Turchi LLP, Wilmington, \nDelaware.  \n \n          \n January  21, 202 2 \nWilmington, Delaware  1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Darnell H. Fullman, Sr., who proceeds pro se, filed this employment \ndiscrimination act ion pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, et seq ., and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as \namended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621, et seq. (D.I. 2).   Before the Court is Plaintiff\u2019s motion for \nrelief from judgment or order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) and (c)(1).  (D.I. 67).  \nDefendant  TC Electric Co.  opposes.   (D.I. 68).     \nBACKGROUND  \nOn August 13,  2020, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant \nTC Electric Co. and against Plaintiff Darn ell H. Fullman, Sr.   (D.I. 62, 63).  Judgment \nwas entered on August 19, 2020.  (D.I. 64).  Both orders were sent to Plaintiff at his \naddress of record via U.S. Mail and neither were returned to the Court.  \nPlaintiff  seeks relief from judgment  and submitted a notarized statement of a \nwitness presenting \u201c new evidence. \u201d  (D.I. 67).  The notarized statement dated August \n2, 2021, states that DeShire Johnson was an employee of Defendant in 2015, that he \ncan confirm a supervisor made a statement that \u201che was going to get ri d of certain \nemployees and have only Mexicans working for him ,\u201d and that an employee helper did \nnot always have to report to the shop in the morning and w as able to meet at the jo bsite \nif the materials was already there.  (D.I. 67- 1).    \nPlaintiff states that he submitted a request to the Court on February 3, 2021 for a \ncase update \u201cdue to no response from last f iling in 2019.\u201d  (D.I. 67).  The Court docket \nindicates that the request was dated March 3, 2021, and it was docketed on March 5, 2 \n 2021.  (D.I. 65).  Finally, Plaintiff states that he was not made aware that judgm ent \nwas entered until March 8, 2021.  (D.I. 67).    \nDefendant opposes and argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish a right to relief \nunder Rule 60(b)(2) on the grounds that the proffered evidence is immaterial to the \njudgment entered against him , and he failed to show that he was unable to obtain \nJohnson\u2019s statement through the exercise of due diligence.  (D.I. 68).   \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court will deny the motion.  \nRULE 60  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure  60(b) provides that a party may file a motion for \nrelief from a final judgment for the following reasons:  \n(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly \ndiscovered evidence, that with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new tr ial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud \n(whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation or other misconduct by an opposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the \njudgment has been satisfied, released , or discharged; it is based on an \nearlie r judgment that has been rev ersed or vacated; or applying it \nprospectively is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief.  \n \nA motion filed pursuant to Rule 60(b) is addressed to the sound discretion of the \ntrial court guided by accepted legal principles applied in light of all relevant \ncircumstances.  Pierce Assoc., Inc. v. Nemours Found., 865 F.2d 530, 548 (3d Cir. 1988).  A motion filed under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time and, for motions under Rule 60(b)(1), (2),  and (3), must be filed no more than one year after \nentry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(c)(1).     3 \n  \nDISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff seeks relief under Rule 60(b)(2)  based on  newly discovered evidence.  \nRule 60(b)(2) provides that a party may file a motion for relief from a final judgment \nbased upon \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).\u201d  Rule 60(b)(2) \u201crequires that t he new evidence (1) be material and not merely cumulative, (2) could not \nhave been discovered before trial through the exercise of reasonable diligence, and (3) would probably have changed the outcome of the trial.  Any party requesting such relief bears a  heavy burden .\u201d  Compass Tech., Inc. v. Tseng Lab., Inc ., 71 F.3d 1125, 1130 \n(3d Cir. 1995).   \nThe information upon which Plaintiff  relies upon does not suffice to provide relief \nunder Rule 60(b)(2).  Plaintiff does not assert that the information was unavailable to him when the Court issued its August 13, 2020 memorandum opinion and order that granted Defendant summary judgment.  Therefore, Plaintiff did not act with \u201creasonable \ndiligence.\u201d  Moreover, the information contained the statement would not have changed \nthe resolution of the motion for summary judgment.  The statement of an unnamed \nsupervisor at an unspecified time anywhere fr om one to thirteen months before \nPlaintiff\u2019s termination  is too vague to be material.  The statement that employees did \nnot always have to report to the shop is irrelevant to the stated basis for termination, which was for lateness, not for going directly to the job site.   4 \n I note that Plaintiff contends that he never received the Court\u2019s August 13, 2020 \nruling .  Even if this is true, it is irrelevant.  Whether Plaintiff did, or did not, receive the \nCourt\u2019s rulings has no bearing on the  relief under Rule 60( b)(2).  Plaintiff has not met \nhis burden to show that he is entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(2).  Therefore, the \nmotion will be denied.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiff\u2019s motion for relief under Rule \n60.  \nAn appropriate Order will be entered.  \n  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n \n FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nDARNELL H.
