Civil Action No. 22-112-GBW\n\nCHANG KUO-HUA, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n1. Introduction. Flora Hoi filed this Sarbanes-Oxley Complaint on\nbehalf of EVA USA on January 27, 2022. (D.I. 1) Hoi appears pro se and has\npaid the filing fee. Before the Court are numerous motions including a motion to\nintervene and a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to transfer filed by EVA\nAirways Corporation (D.L. 7, 10), as well as several motions filed by Hoi (DI. 14,\n17, 20, 21, 23, 25)\n\n2. The Complaint asserts venue in this Court pursuant to 28 US.C. \u00a7\n1391(a). (DL. 1 at 2) The Complaint raises clams under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A and\nincorporates laws under the State of Delaware including Delaware Code Title VIII,\nSection 145. Cd. at 1, 8,11) The caption of the Complaint is \u201cEVA USA vs.\nBOARD DIRECTORS\u201d while the body of the Complaint names Hoi as a Plaintiff/\n\nComplainant. Ud. at 1, 11) It is signed \u201cFlora Hoi, and on behalf EVA, USA.\u201d\n1\n\n(id. at 29) The gist of the Complaint is that Hoi, an assistant manager for EVA\nAirways Corporation at DFW-Airport in Dallas, Texas, was placed on furlough\nafter she filed an internal report that alleged \u201cmisconduct of unsavory managerial\npractice physical abuse intention pattern to cause employees pain suffering serious\nharm, whom in turn falsely and fraudulently pretenses, representations, or\npromises, spurious article furlough of COVID-19 pandemic for the purpose of\nexecuting such scheme or artifice to retaliate [Hoi\u2019s] whistle blowing in the\ninternal report.\u201d (/d. at 11, 12) EVA Airways Corporation has filed a motion to\nintervene (D.I. 7) unopposed by Hoi, and a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative,\nto transfer (D.I. 10) also unopposed by Hoi, although Hoi\u2019s motion to manage\n_ pleadings for application enlargement (D.I. 14) could be construed as a response.\n3. Motion to Intervene. EVA Airways Corporation moves to\nintervene as a defendant on the grounds that: (1) Hoi is not an officer of EVA and\ndoes not have authority to sue on its behalf; (2) EVA does not consent to being a\nplaintiff in this action and does not desire to maintain an action against its Board;\nand (3) the underlying basis of Hoi\u2019s Complaint is her termination of employment\nfrom EVA and, thus, EVA is a crucial party to this matter as a defendant. (D.I. 7,\n\nD.L 8 at 4)\n4. \u201cA motion to intervene . . . must state the grounds for intervention and\nbe accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which\nintervention is sought.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c). Rule 24(a) provides as follows:\n\nOn timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who: (1)\n\nis given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or (2)\n\nclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the\n\nsubject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action\n\nmay as a practical matter impair or impede the movant\u2019s ability to\nprotect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that\ninterest.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). To intervene by right, a party must show \u201c(1) a sufficient\ninterest in the litigation; (2) \u2018a threat that the interest will be impaired or affected,\nas a practical matter, by the disposition of the action\u2019; and (3) that its interest is not\nadequately represented by the existing parties to the litigation.\u201d Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania v. President United States of Am., 888 F.3d 52, 57 (3d Cir. 2018)\n(citation omitted) (emphasis added). \u201c[A]n applicant\u2019s interests are not\nadequately represented if they diverge sufficiently from the interests of the existing\nparty, such that \u2018the existing party cannot devote proper attention to the applicant\u2019s\ninterests.\u2019\u201d Jd. at 60 (citation omitted).\n\n5. Rule 24(b) allows the Court to permit the intervention of any party\nwho \u201c(A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or (B) has a\n\nclaim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or\n\nfact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1). \u201c[D]istrict courts have broader discretion in\nmaking a determination about whether permissive intervention is appropriate as\nopposed to intervention as of right.\u201d United States v. Territory of Virgin Islands,\n748 F.3d 514, 524 (3d Cir. 2014).\n\n6. The requisites for intervention as of right, as well as permissive\nintervention have been met by EVA Airways Corporation. Therefore, the motion\nto intervene as a defendant will be granted. (D.I. 7)\n\n7. Motion to Transfer. EVA Airways Corporation moves to dismiss\nor, in the alternative, to transfer this matter to the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of Texas. (D.I. 10, 11) The Court turns to the venue issue.\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil action to\nany other district: (1) if the other district is one in which the action might have\nbeen brought or to which all the parties have consented and (2) transfer is for the\nconvenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice.\n\n8. It is clear from the record that that this action could have been brought\nin Texas. Hoi was employed in Texas and her employment was terminated in\nTexas. The Court next turns to whether transfer of this action to Texas is for the\nconvenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice. To make\nthis determination, the Court must balance several private and public interest\n\nfactors. In Re Howmedica Osteonics Corp, 867 F.3d 390, 401 (3d Cir. 2017).\n9. Private interest factors are: (1) the plaintiff's choice of forum; (2) the\ndefendant\u2019s preferred forum; (3) where the claim arose; (4) the convenience of the\nparties; (5) the convenience of the witnesses; and (6) the location of books and\nrecords. Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995). Public\ninterest factors are: (1) the enforceability of the judgment; (2) practical\nconsiderations that could make the trial easier, quicker, or less expensive; (3) court\ncongestion; (4) local interest in the controversy; (5) public policies of the fora; and\n(6) the trial judge\u2019s familiarity with the applicable state law. Id.\n\n10. Here, the only private factor that supports venue in this District is that\nPlaintiff opted to file her complaint here. EVA prefers to litigate in Texas, the\nclaim arose in Texas, all the parties and witnesses are in Texas, and it appears that\nall the physical evidence is located in Texas. Most public factors are neutral but a\nfew also favor transfer particularly the practical considerations that all parties and\nwitnesses are in Texas and the possible local interest in the controversy\n\n11. On balance, the factors support transfer. Therefore, the motion to\ntransfer to the Northern District of Texas will be granted.\n\n12. Conclusion. For the reasons discussed above, the Court will: (1)\ngrant EVA Airways Corporation\u2019s motion to intervene (D.I. 7); (2) grant EVA\nAirways Corporation\u2019s motion to transfer (D.I. 10); (3) deny without prejudice to\n\nrenew upon transfer the motion to dismiss and Plaintiff's pending motions (D.I. 10,\n\n14, 17, 20, 21, 23, 25); and (4) transfer the matter to the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Texas. A separate order shall issue.\n\nAla.\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\nwae\nOctober u 4 , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n"}
