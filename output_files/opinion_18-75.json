{"case_name": "USA v. Bacon et al", "case_number": "18-75", "judge": "Judge Leonard P. Stark", "date": "01-12-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nV.\nMICHAEL PRITCHETT,\nDefendant.Crim. No. 18-75-LPS-3\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nWHEREAS, Defendant Pritchett previously filed a motion to suppress evidence (D.I. 169),\nwhich the Court denied (D.1.224 at 8-13; D.I. 225 3);\nWHEREAS, on January 5,2022, Pritchett filed a second motion to suppress evidence (D.!\n290) and two exhibits in support of that motion (D.I. 290-1,290-2);\nWHEREAS, on January 6,2022, the government filed a response to Pritchett's second\nmotion to suppress (D.I. 292);\nWHEREAS, Pritchett opted not to file a reply brief in support of his second motion to\nsuppress;\nWHEREAS, the Court has carefully considered all materials submitted in connection with\nPritchett's second motion to suppress (D.l. 290,290-1,290-2,292);\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Pritchett's second motion to\nsuppress evidence (D.l. 290) is DENIED.\nThe Court agrees with the arguments in the government's response to Pritchett's motion.\n(See generally D.l. 292 at 2-8) As a preliminary matter, Pritchett's motion is untimely. Pretrial\nmotions were due in April 2021. Pritchett initially complied with that deadline when he filed his\nfirst motion to suppress evidence obtained from the -9818 and -5088 phones. Now, many months\nlater and essentially on the eve of trial, he has not offered any explanation for why he did not pursuehis current challenges to the warrants at that time, or (at a minimum) why he did not seek leave to\npursue additional challenges to the warrants shortly after the August 3 hearing on all pretrial\nmotions. (See generally D.I. 212 at 40-41) (Pritchett withdrawing portion of first motion to\nsuppress) Pritchett's motion may be denied on this ground alone. See, e.g., Fed. R. Crim. P.\n12(c)(3) (\"If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 12(b)(3) motion, the motion is\nuntimely.\").\nIn any event, even if Pritchett's second motion to suppress were timely, it is meritless. The\nchallenged warrants specifically identify the -9818 and -5088 phones; they are not \"general\nwarrants.\" (See generally D.I. 290-1,290-2) Further, although Pritchett argues that the warrants\ndo not even mention records related to FaceTime communications (D.I. 290 at 6), the warrants\nexplicitly refer to \"call logs,\" which fairly encompasses FaceTime logs, when one takes the required\n\"common sense\" view of the warrant. United States v. American Investors of Pittsburgh, Inc., 879\nF.2d 1087,1106 (3d Or. 1989); see also D.l. 290-1 at 1; D.I. 290-2 at 1; D.I. 292 at 5.\nFinally, even if the warrants were somehow faulty, under the good faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule, the Court still would not suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to them. See\ngenerally United States v. Hodge, 246 F.3d 301,307-08 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"The mere existence of a\nwarrant typically suffices to prove that an officer conducted a search in good faith and justifies\napplication of the good faith exception.\").\nAccordingly, the government may rely on evidence obtained from the -9818 and -5088\nphones at trial. -\u2014-7^ fj/  ^\nJanuary 12,2022 HONOR/iBLE LEONARD P.TT^R^\n^^Tihnington, Delaware UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE"}
