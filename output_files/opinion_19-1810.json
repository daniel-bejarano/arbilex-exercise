Williams", "date": "09-15-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPERSONAL GENOMICS TAIWAN , INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nPACIFIC BIOSCIENCES OF CALIFORNIA , \nINC., \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 19-1810-GBW-MPT \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nAt Wilmington , Delaware this 15th day of September , 2022. \nHaving reviewed the parties' briefing and other materials filed with respect to \nDefendant and Counter-Claimant Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.' s (\"PacBio\") \nmotion to stay pending appeal of inter partes review (\"IPR\") No. IPR2020-01200 (D.I. 40; \nD.I. 41; D.I. 46; D.I. 50; D.I. 66; D.I. 67),1 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that PacBio's \nmotion (D.I. 40) is GRANTED , for the reasons stated below. It is further ORDERED that, \nwithin 30 days of the resolution of PacBio's appeal of IPR2020-01200 , the parties shall \nnotify the Court of the outcome of the appeal and the implications of the outcome on this \ncase and file a motion or proposed stipulation to lift or continue the current stay. \n1. On June 22, 2020 and June 27, 2020, PacBio filed two IPR petitions against United \nStates Patent No. 7,767,441 (the \"'441 patent\") at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board \n1 The parties' Joint Status Report and Interim Status Report have also been considered in \nconnection with the pending motion. D.I. 36; D.I. 85. \n1 (\"PTAB\"). On August 25, 2020, the Court entered the parties' joint stipulation to stay this \ncase pending the IPR proceedings. D.I. 33. \n2. The PT AB issued Final Written Decisions in both IPRs on January 18, 2022. In \nIPR2020-01163, the PTAB found that claims 1-6, 9, and 43-58 of the '441 patent were \nunpatentable. Pacific Biosciences of California , Inc. v. Personal Genomics Taiwan, Inc., \nIPR2020-01163, Paper 31 (P.T.A.B. Jan. 18, 2022). In IPR2020-01200 , the PTAB found \nthat claims 1, 2, 6, 7, 10-22, 24, and 27-36 of the '441 patent have not been shown to be \nunpatentable. Pacific Biosciences of California , Inc. v. Personal Genomics Taiwan, Inc., \nIPR2020-01200, Paper 31 (P.T.A.B. Jan. 18, 2022). The net results of these two IPRs is \nthat the PT AB confirmed the patentability of 17 claims of the '441 patent that Plaintiff and \nCounter-Defendant Personal Genomics Taiwan, Inc. (\"PGI\") is asserting against PacBio. \nOn January 24, 2022, PacBio filed a Notice of Appeal with the Federal Circuit regarding \nthe PTAB's decision in IPR2020-01 200. On February 2, 2022, this Court lifted the stay \nand instructed the parties that , if \"either party seek[ s] a stay pending appeal, it must do so \nin a timely manner.\" D.I. 37. \n3. On February 16, 2022, fourteen (14) days after this Court lifted the stay, PacBio \nmoved to stay this case pending its appeal. D.I. 40. PGI opposed. Id On March 18, 2022, \nPGI filed a Notice of Appeal with the Federal Circuit regarding the PTAB's decision in \nIPR2020-01163. \n4. A court has discretionary authority to grant a motion to stay. See Dentsply Int'l \nInc. v. Kerr Mfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990). Courts generally consider \nthree factors to determine whether a stay is appropriate : (1) whether granting the stay will \nsimplify the issues for trial; (2) the status of the litigation, particularly whether discovery \n2 is complete and a trial date has been set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non\u00ad\nmovant to suffer undue prejudice from any delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical \nadvantage. See Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS , \n2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing Ethicon LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, \nInc., C.A. No. 17-871-LPS , 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2019)). In this \naction, these factors favor granting a stay. \n5. A stay would simplify the issues before this Court. The key issue in PacBio's \nappeal will be the proper scope of \"an apparatus for identifying a single molecule,\" which \nappears in the preamble in all independent claims of the '441 patent and is one of two \ndisputed claim terms in this case. The Federal Circuit's decision regarding the proper scope \nof the disputed term \"an apparatus for identifying a single molecule\" will likely affect claim \nconstruction, fact discovery, and expert discovery in this case. Judicial efficiencies would \nbe gained by staying this case rather than have this Court and the Federal Circuit address \nthe construction of the same term in parallel. Thus, this further weighs in favor of a stay. \n6. The stage of this litigation weighs in favor of a stay. Fact discovery is in its early \nstages-no depositions have been taken. Claim construction briefing is complete but no \nMarkman hearing date has been set. See D.l. 77; D.I. 78. \n7. A stay will not unduly prejudice PGI. In a Joint Status Report, PGI asserts that a \ndelay of this litigation \"harms PGI's ability to commercialize its own products in the face \nof competition from Pac Bio and other sequencing companies. \" DJ. 36 at 4. But, as noted \nby PacBio, PGI \"fails to identify a single product that it manufactures or provide any details \nwhatsoever about products that it plans to manufacture. \" D.I. 41 at 13. PGI failed to \n3 identify such products in its briefing. See D.I. 46 at 18-20. PGI's damages, if any, are \nmonetary. \n8. Thus, given the pertinent factors weigh in favor of a stay, PacBio's motion to stay \nthis litigation pending appeal of IPR2020-01 200 is GRANTE~/l\"N). \nGREGORY B.
