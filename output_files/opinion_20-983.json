Murphy\u201d) brings this products liability \naction against Defendants St. Jude Medical, LLC and Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, \u201cSt. \nJude\u201d or \u201cDefendants\u201d).  Presently before the Court is St. Jude\u2019s mo tion to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s \nAmended Complaint, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (the \u201cMotion\u201d).  (D.I. 24)  For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS -IN-PART and DENIES -IN-PART  St. \nJude\u2019s Motion.    I. BACKGROUND \n A. Factual Background  \n Mr. Murphy, a New Jersey resident, has experienced low back pain since the early 1990s.  \n(D.I. 17 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 78)  Following a lumbar spine surgery in 1996, his symptoms ultimately worsened , and he experienced radiation of pain and weakness in both legs.  ( Id. at \u00b6 78)  In \nMarch 2014, Mr. Murphy underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure performed in New York, New York by Dr. George DiGiacinto ; the procedure was meant  to address diagnoses \nof L4 -5 spondylosis and L5- S1 instability.  ( Id. at \u00b6 79)  Mr. Murphy\u2019s pain management \nspeci alist, Dr. Ajay Varma, subsequently recommended a spinal cord stimulator trial after \nconservative medical treatment failed to improve Mr. Murphy\u2019s functional capacity or help with \nhis reliance on opioid medications.  ( Id. at \u00b6 80)   \n On October 11, 2017, Mr. Murphy proceeded with surgery to facilitate a spinal cord stimulator trial (via the implantation of two St. Jude Octrode leads connecting to an external implantable pulse generator, or \u201c IPG\u201d); the surgery was performed by Dr. Varma in Middletown, \nNew Je rsey.  ( Id. at \u00b6 81)  The trial went well, as  the device reduced  Mr. Murphy\u2019s pain, allowed \nhim to be more functionally active and helped him to  use less pain medication.  ( Id. at \u00b6 82)  Mr. \n3 \n Murphy decided to proceed with a permanent implant of a St. Jude spinal cord stimulator device \n(i.e., the Proclaim\u2122 7 Elite Model 3662\u2014hereinafter referred to as the \u201cProclaim 1\u201d\u2014and Octrode leads).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 82- 83)   \n The surgery took place on Decem ber 6, 2017 in Holmdel, New Jersey.  ( Id. at \u00b6 83)  D r. \nVarma sur gically implanted the IPG into a surgically- created pocket in Mr. Murphy\u2019s right \nbuttock, and the IPG was connected to two St. Jude Model 3186 Oct rode leads.  ( Id.)  A St. Jude \nrepresentative was present during the procedure.  ( Id.)   \n In the months following the surgery, Mr. Murphy experienced little to no relief from his \npain, despite repeated efforts to re- program the Proclaim 1  for better pain c overage.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 84, \n85)  On December 14, 2018, Mr. Murphy underwent x- rays of the lumbar spine , which revealed \nthat the tips of the leads had slipped.  ( Id. at \u00b6 85)   Dr. Varma recommended that a third \npercutaneous lead be implanted to take the place of the least effective lead.  ( Id.)   \n Mr. Murphy consulted with Dr. DiGiacinto for a second opinion.  ( Id. at \u00b6 86)  Dr. \nDiGiacinto recommended that the two implanted leads be replaced by a paddle -type lead, and he \nsubsequently performed this procedure on February 22, 2019 in New York, New Yor k.  (Id.)  \nThe placement of the paddle lead in Mr. Murphy\u2019s thoracic spine required Dr. DiGiacinto to perform a partial laminectomy of the T9 disc space.  ( Id.)  The new lead was then passed through \na tunnel from the thoracic incision to the right upper buttock and connected to a replacement Proclaim Elite spinal cord stimulator device (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cProclaim 2\u201d) .  (Id. at \n\u00b6\u00b6 10, 86)  A St. Jude representative was present during this procedure  and took possession of \nthe Proclaim 1 .  (Id. at \u00b6 86)   Dr. DiGiacinto\u2019s operative report described the Proclaim 1 as a \n\u201c[m]alfunctioned spinal cord stimulator.\u201d  ( Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) )   4 \n  The Proclaim 2 did not work any better than the Proclaim 1, even with repeated attempts \nto re-program the device .  (Id. at \u00b6 87)  Beginning in or around May 2019, Mr. Murphy began to \nexperience burning pain and electrical s hocks at the site of the IPG and across his lower back.  \n(Id.)  These episodes also caused  an increase in Mr. Murphy\u2019s right leg pain, which he described \nas feeling like \u201cboiling water.\u201d  ( Id. (internal quotation marks omitted))   \n On August 12, 2019, Mr. Murphy saw Dr. DiGiacinto\u2019s partner Dr. Chan Roonprapunt.  \n(Id. at \u00b6 88)   Mr. Murphy repor ted specific pain over the IPG site  and requested that the Proclaim \n2 be surgically explanted.  ( Id.)  On October 4, 2019, Dr. Roonprapunt surgically removed the \nProclaim 2 and the leads from Mr. Murphy\u2019s body in New York, New York.  ( Id.)    \nB. Procedural  History  \nMr. Murphy filed this action on July 24, 2020.  (D.I. 2 )  On January 28, 2021, M r. \nMurphy filed the currently operative Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC \u201d).  (D.I. 1 7)  In the FAC, Mr. \nMurphy has asserted claims under New Jersey law for strict product liability for manufacturing \ndefect (Count s I and II ) and strict product liability for failure to warn (Count III) .1  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 90-\n136; D.I. 31 at 1 n.2)  In lieu of filing an answer, on February 18, 2021, St. Jude filed the instant \nMotion.  ( D.I. 24 )  The Moti on was fully briefed on March 18, 2021.  ( D.I. 36)2 \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Court incorporates by reference the legal principles regarding motions to dismiss \nfiled pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and those regarding the legal doctr ine \nof preemption, all of which were set out in its Memorandum Opinion in the related case Mellott \n \n1  Mr. Murphy\u2019s failure to warn claim in the FAC is  based on a \u201cfail ure to \nsupplement product\u2019s labeling\u201d theory; he is no longer pressing a failure to warn claim based on \na \u201cfailure to report adverse events\u201d theory.  (D.I. 31 at 1)   \n \n2  The parties have consented to the  Court\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct all proceedings \nin the case, including trial, the entry of final judgment and all post -trial proceedings.  (D.I. 13)  5 \n v. St. Jude Med., LLC , Civil Action No. 19- 1779- CJB (D. Del. Nov. 16, 2020) (D.I. 45 at 7- 8, 9-\n14).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The Court here writes primarily for t he parties, who are well familiar with the issues in \nthis case.  In doing so, t he Court assumes  familiarity  with  the fol lowing opinions that are relevant \nto the Court\u2019s decision here:  (1) the December 23, 2020 and October 27, 2021 Memorandum \nOpinions in t he related case Guinn v.  St. Jude Med., LLC  (hereinafter,  \u201cGuinn \u201d), Civil Action \nNo. 20- 71-CJB (D.I. 50 (hereinafter, \u201c Guinn I \u201d); D.I. 7 7 (hereinafter, \u201c Guinn II \u201d)) (D. Del .); and \n(2) the November 29, 2021 Memorandum Opinion in the related case Ross v. St. Jude Med., \nLLC, Civil Action No. 20 -971-CJB (D.I. 42 ( hereinafter , \u201cRoss \u201d)) (D. Del.).  The plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims in Guinn and Ross also involve the Proclaim device (i.e., the same device at issue here).  \n(Ross  at 6)   \n Here, St. Jude moves to dismiss all of  Mr. Murphy\u2019s claims.  (D.I. 25 at 1)  Most of St. \nJude\u2019s arguments for dismissal here are similar or identical to arguments that the Court has \nalready considered and rejected in Guinn II  and in Ross.  ( See id . at 2 ( \u201cPlaintiff here filed an \nAmended Compla int with substantively the same new factual allegations as  in the Guinn \nAmended Complaint, but these only serve to confirm that the Proclaim device is different from \nthe earlier SCS devices, and that there are no allegations sufficient to state a parallel claim.\u201d) ; id. \nat 10 (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s [Proclaim -specific allegations in the FAC] here do[] not cure the [] problems\u201d \ndescribed in Guinn I .); see also Ross  at 6- 9)  For the same reasons as discussed in Guinn II  \n(which the Court will not repeat here), the  FAC\u2019s allegations are sufficient to establish plausible \nclaims that the Proclaim devices implanted in M r. Murphy w ere defective and that St. Jude failed \nto supplement the labeling of the Proclaim to warn of such defects.  ( See Guinn II at 5 -13)  And 6 \n for the same reasons discuss ed in Guinn II , these plausibly- pled claims survive preemption.  ( Id. \nat 13 & n.8; see also D.I. 31 at 13 -15)   \n St. Jude makes one unique argument for dismissal , relating to  Count II , which was not at \nplay in Guinn and Ross .  (D.I. 25 at 16; D.I. 36 at 9- 10)  The Court will take up that argument \nhere.  \nCount II is labeled in the FAC as \u201cStrict Product Liability Based on [New Jersey\u2019s] \nIndeterminate Product Test[.]\u201d  (D.I. 17 at 32; D.I. 31 at 1 n.2)   The FAC purports to allege a \nclaim based on the \u201cindeterminate product test\u201d as set forth by the Restatement (Third) of Torts, \nwhich has been adopted in New Jersey.  ( D.I. 17 at \u00b6 112)   This test provides that:  \nIt may be inferred that the harm sustained by the plaintiff was \ncaused by a product de fect existing at the time of sale or \ndistribution, without proof of a specific defect, when the incident \nthat harmed the plaintiff:  \n \n(a) was of a kind that  ordinar ily occurs as a result of product \n defect; and  \n  \n(b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other \nthan product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution.  \n \nRestatement (Third) of Torts  \u00a7 3 (1998) ; see also Myrlak v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 723 A.2d \n45, 55 (N.J. 1999).  In its opening brief, St. Jude argue s with re spect to Count II that, inter alia ,  \nno such standalone claim based on the indeterminate product test exists ; instead, St. Jude asserts \nthat this test \u201callows the factfinder to dr aw an inference that a product is defective under certain \nlimited circumstanc es.\u201d  (D.I. 25 at 16 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) )  The \nCourt agrees.  \n As even Mr. Murphy acknowledges, \u201cNew Jersey courts have addressed the \nindeterminate product test as a separate method for proving a manufacturing defect [.]\u201d  (D.I. 3 1 \nat 15  (emphasis added )); see also Great N . Ins. Co. v. Schwartz , Docket No. L -5819- 06, 2011 7 \n WL 2304135, at *5 ( N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. June 1, 2011) (referring to the indeterminate \nproduct test as a \u201cmode of proof\u201d); Snell v. Bostrom Prods. Co., [D]ock et No. L -5865- 00, 2005 \nWL 2654303, at *3 ( N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Oct. 19, 2005) (referring to the indeterminat e \nproduct test as a \u201c method of proof\u201d).  In other words, under New Jersey law, a plaintiff can prove  \nthe existence of a manufacturing defect b y: (1) relying on direct evidence; (2) relying on \ncircumstantial evidence; (3) negatin g other causes of the failu re of the product for which the \ndefendant would not be responsible, in order to create an inference that the defect was \nattributable to the man ufacturer; or (4) relying on the indeterminate product test.  See, e.g., \nMcManus v. Barnegat Operating Co., L.P. , 828 F. App\u2019x 846, 848- 49 (3d. Cir. 2020); Smith v. \nCovidien LP , 1:19- cv-11981- NLH- AMD, 2019 WL 7374793, at *5 & n.3 (D.N.J. Dec. 31, \n2019) .   \n But as St. Jude notes, while the indeterminate product test is undisputedly one evidentiary \nmethod of prov ing a manufacturing defect  claim under New Jersey law , the test does not itself \namount to a legal claim.  The legal claim that Mr. Murphy press es is for s trict liability \nmanufacturing defect under the PLA , and Mr. Murphy has already set out that claim in Count I .  \nGoing forward, Mr. Murphy may wish to rely on the indeterminate product test as a method of \nproving up his claim in Count I.   But because th e Court is not persuaded that Mr. Murphy\u2019s \nclaim in Count II really is an independent, separate legal claim from that pleaded in Count I, the \nCourt GRANTS the portion of St. Jude\u2019s Motion requesting that Count II be dismissed with \nprejudice.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  8 \n The Court GRANTS -IN-PART and DENIES -IN-PART  the Motion, in that it GRANTS \nthe Motion as to Count II and will dismiss Count II with prejudice, but it DENIES the Motion as \nto Counts I and III.   \n An appropriate Order follows.  \nBecause this Memorandum Opini on may contain confidential inf ormation, it has been \nreleased under seal, pending review by the parties to allow them to submit a single, jointly proposed, redacted version (if necessary) of the  Memorandum Opinion.  Any such redacted \nversion shall be submi tted no later than December 8, 2021 for review by the Court .  It should be \naccompanied by  a motion for redaction that shows that the presumption of public access to \njudicial records has been rebutted with respect to the proposed redacted material, by including a factually -detailed explanation as to how that material is the \u201ckind of information that courts will \nprotect and that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure.\u201d  In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Court will subsequently issue a \npublicly- available version of its  Memorandum Opinion. "}
