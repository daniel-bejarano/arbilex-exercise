Pro Se Petitioner.\nSean P. Lugg, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Attorney for Respondents.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION^\nMarch 9, 2023\nWilmington, Delaware\n^This case was re-assigned to the undersigned\u2019s docket on September 7, 2022.%\nWilliams, District Judge:\nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner Joshua Stephenson\u2019s\nAmended Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\n(D.I. 12; D.I. 17) The State filed an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner\nfiled a Reply. (D.I. 20; D.I. 35) For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the\nAmended Petition.\nI. BACKGROUND\n0]n December 24, 2012, [Petitioner] visited the home of\nhis sister, Ruth Ann Stephenson (\u201cRuth\u201d); Ruth's six-\nyear-old son, Myron Ashley, Jr. (\u201cMyron Jr.\u201d); and\nMyron Jr.'s father, Myron Ashley, Sr. (\u201cAshley\u201d).\nPetitioner] had previously lived at the home, but had\nrecently moved to his grandparents' house. After talking\nwith [Petitioner] for a period of time, Ruth sent Myron Jr.\nupstairs to take a bath. Ruth and Ashley continued to\ntalk with [Petitioner], and then Ruth went upstairs to help\nMyron Jr. with his bath. While Myron Jr. was in the\nbathtub, Ruth, who had worked a double shift that day,\nlay down for a moment and fell asleep. She awoke when\nshe heard two gunshots downstairs. She ran downstairs.\nMyron Jr. heard a gunshot while he was in the bathtub\nand ran downstairs after Ruth. Ruth saw Ashley lying on\nthe floor in the living room, in front of the sofa.\nPetitioner] was sitting on the smaller love seat. Ruth\nyelled at [Petitioner] \u201cwhat did you do?\u201d and grabbed at\nhim. He punched her in the face and quickly left the\nhouse.\nOfficers arrested [Petitioner] several hours later in the\nbasement of his grandparents' home. They also found a\nleather jacket with Ashley's blood on it, along with other\nclothing items that [Petitioner] had been wearing at\nRuth's house that night.Ashley's death was caused by two gunshot wounds-\nof which went through his left arm, and one of which\nentered and exited his right arm and then entered and\nexited his torso. When investigating the scene of the\nshooting, police officers found a gun on the loveseat and\nfour spent shell casings and a bullet in various areas of\nthe living room. They also found two gunshot holes in\nthe sofa and corresponding holes in the wall behind the\nsofa and in the floor under the sofa. They were unable to\nlocate those two bullets or any bullet or hole that\ncorresponded to the fourth shell casing. The gun had\nPetitioner\u2019s] DNA on it, as well as the DNA of at least\ntwo other, unidentified individuals. Ballistics testing\nrevealed that the shell casings had been fired from the\ngun that was found on the loveseat. Swabs that were\ntaken of [Petitioner\u2019s] hands after his arrest tested\npositive for gunshot residue.\u25a0one\nStephenson v. State, 225 A.3d 983 (Table), 2020 WL 821418, at *1 (Del. Feb. 18,\n2020).\nOn December 25, 2012, Wilmington Police arrested Petitioner and\nsubsequently charged him by indictment with first degree murder, possession of a\nfirearm during the commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d), possession of a firearm by\na person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u201d), third degree assault, and endangering the welfare\nof a child. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. 1;D.L 18-4 at 19-21) At Petitioner\u2019s\npreliminary hearing, the Superior Court ordered a formal evaluation of Petitioner\u2019s\ncompetency to stand trial. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. 19) On August 22, 2013, Dr.\nDouglass Schultz, a licensed psychologist, submitted a report following his July\n22013 interview with Petitioner in which he concluded that Petitioner was\ncompetent to stand trial. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. 20; D.I. 18-12 at 14) On\nDecember 10, 2013, pursuant to trial counsel\u2019s request for a psychiatric\nexamination of Petitioner, Dr. Susan Rushing, M.D., an assistant professor of\npsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, submitted a report to trial counsel in\nwhich she opined that Petitioner was competent to stand trial. (D.I. 18-12 at 14-\n15) Additionally, on January 31, 2014, the State moved for a psychiatric\nevaluation of Petitioner by a mental health professional, which the court granted.\n(D.I. 18-1 at Entry Nos. 25, 29) The State\u2019s expert, Dr. Stephen Mechanik, M.D.,\nevaluated Petitioner and issued a report on April 22, 2014, in which he opined that\nPetitioner was competent to stand trial or enter  aplea. (D.I. 18-12 at 15-16)\nOn March 20, 2014, Dr. Rushing prepared a report regarding Petitioner\u2019s\nmental health issues and \u201cDefenses to Criminal Liability.\u201d (D.I. 18-14 at 83-94)\nOn May 20, 2014, the State filed a motion to preclude Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony\nrelating to the use of self-defense. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. D.I. 32; D.I. 18-14 at\n72-81) On May 21, 2014, Petitioner responded. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. 33; D.I.\n18-14 at 104-106) On June 9, 2014, the Superior Court held a hearing on the\nState\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony and other motions. (D.I. 18-1\nat Entry No42; D.I. 18-14 at 107-135) On June 17, 2014, the Superior Court\n3orally granted the State\u2019s motion to preclude Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony (D.L 18-14\nat 136-138), and on June 20, 2014, the court issued a formal opinion, ruling that\nit would not allow Dr. Rushing to testify about self-defense, stating:\nThere is nothing in Dr. Rushing\u2019s report addressing how\nPetitioner] perceived events on December 24 and\ntherefore her testimony will not assist the trier of fact on\nthis issue. Indeed, Dr. Rushing seemingly disavows any\nattempt to relate [Petitioner\u2019s] mental condition to his\nperception of those events - she states in her report that\n\u201c[i]f [Petitioner] presents a defense of self-defense at\ntrial, [Petitioner\u2019s] mental illness is unlikely to be\nrelevant to such a defense.\u201d\n(D.L 18-14 at 139-150). Petitioner moved for reargument (D.L 18-1 56), and the\nSuperior Court ruled that, if Petitioner testified. Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony might be\nallowed under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 3507 to show a prior consistent statement with\nPetitioner\u2019s possible self-defense testimony. (D.L 18-14 at 190-191)\nPrior to trial, Petitioner waived a jury trial on the PFBPP charge and his right\nto a speedy trial, and the Superior Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to sever the\nPFBPP charge. (D.L 18-1 at Entry No. 59) The Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s\nmotion to admit evidence that the victim was convicted in 2007 for possession of a\nfirearm during the commission of a felony. (D.L 18-1 at Entry No. 67)\nPetitioner\u2019s jury trial on the non-severed charges began on January 5, 2015.\n(D.L 18-1 at Entry No. 71) On January 7, 2015, trial counsel advised the Superior\n4Court that Petitioner had previously rejected the State\u2019s guilty, but mentally ill\n(\u201cGBMI\u201d) plea offer to first degree murder. (D.L 19-3 at 30)\nAfter the State rested, Petitioner moved for a judgment of acquittal. (D.L 19-\n4 at 13-17; D.L 18-8 at 30-34) The Superior Court denied the motion on all\ncharges except third degree assault, for which it reserved decision. (D.L 18-8 at 34;\nD.L 19-4 at 17) On January 12, 2015, before the defense rested. Petitioner elected\nnot to testify in his defense after a verbal colloquy with the Superior Court. (D.L\n18-5 at 54) Thereafter, the Superior Court found that there was insufficient\nevidence of third degree assault and, at the State\u2019s request, submitted the amended\ncharge of offensive touching with the rest of the charges to the jury. (D.L 18-6 at\n16; D.L 18-8 at 36)\nAfter the jury retired for deliberations, the Superior Court, in a bench ruling,\nfound Petitioner guilty of PFBPP. (D.L 18-17 at 41-42) On January 13, 2015, the\njury found Petitioner guilty of second degree murder (as a lesser included offense\nof first degree murder), PFDCF, and endangering the welfare of a child, and not\nguilty of offensive touching. (D.L 18-1 at Entry No. 71) Following the jury\u2019s\nverdict, the Superior Court ordered Petitioner to undergo a\npsychiatric/psychological evaluation by staff at the Delaware Psychiatric Center as\npart of a presentence evaluation. (D.L 18-1 at Entry Nos. 71, 78) On May 1, 2015,\ntrial counsel submitted an additional report from Dr. Rushing opining that she\n5believed Petitioner was competent to proceed to sentencing, and moved to have the\nSuperior Court find Petitioner guilty, but mentally ill. (D.L 18-1 at Entry No. 80)\nOn June 17, 2015, the Superior Court declined to consider Petitioner\u2019s\napplication to find him guilty, but mentally ill, because such a finding was required\nto have been made by the trier of fact. (D.I. 18-17 at 44) The Superior Court\nthen sentenced Petitioner to life in prison for the murder conviction, and for the\nremaining convictions, to twenty-six years suspended after twenty years for\ndecreasing levels of supervision. (D.I. 18-17; D.I. 18-14 at 16-20) Petitioner\nappealed.\nOn direct appeal. Petitioner, through counsel, argued that the Superior\nCourt abused its discretion when it denied his requests to present expert witness\ntestimony from psychiatrist Dr. Rushing and for a self-defense jury instruction.\n(D.I. 18-17 at 55-65) While the appeal was pending. Petitioner filed numerous pro\nse motions for reduction of sentence, which the Superior Court denied on\nSeptember 22, 2015. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry Nos. 89, 91, 92, 96) In denying\nPetitioner\u2019s first such motion, the Superior Court held that his sentence was\nappropriate for all the reasons stated at sentencing and noted that: (1) Petitioner\nwas a dangerous individual when he did not take his medication; (2) the court had\nno confidence that he would take his medications if he was released based upon his\npast failures to do so; and (3) it was highly likely that [Petitioner] will kill again.\n6(D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. 96) The Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s other sentence\nreduction motions as repetitive, noting that Petitioner\u2019s sentence was appropriate\nfor the reasons stated at sentencing, and the Superior Court was aware of, and\ndiscussed. Petitioner\u2019s psychiatric problems extensively at sentencing. (D.I. 18-1\nat Entry Nos. 97-98)\nSubsequently, on June 22, 2016, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed\nPetitioner\u2019s convictions and sentence. See Stephenson v. State, 145 A.3d 7 (Table),\n2016 WL 3568170 (Del. June 22, 2016). On August 3, 2016, Petitioner filed a\ntimely pro se motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Superior Court Criminal\nRule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d) raising nine claims and requested the appointment of\npostconviction counsel. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry Nos. 118-119; D.I. 18-14 at 21-25)\nPostconviction counsel was appointed and filed an amended Rule 61 motion on\nNovember 9, 2017, which raised only one of Petitioner\u2019s initial claims: trial\ncounsel was ineffective for advising him against testifying, even after it became\nclear the Superior Court would not permit his expert Dr. Rushing to testify unless\nPetitioner testified. (D.I. 18-1 at Entry No. 137; D.I. 18-14 at 226-250) The\nSuperior Court subsequently permitted Petitioner to supplement his postconviction\ncounsel\u2019s reply brief with two pro se claims, which asserted that trial counsel was\nineffective when she did not request a competency hearing and the court\ncommitted judicial error when it did not sua sponte hold a competency hearing.\n7(D.L 18-14 at 289-290, 305-306) On April 8, 2019, the Superior Court denied\nPetitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion. (D.L 18-12).\nPetitioner appealed.^ On appeal, Petitioner\u2019s postconviction counsel moved\nto withdraw under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 26(c) (D.L 18-11), and Petitioner\nsubmitted one point for the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s consideration: trial counsel\nwas ineffective for advising Petitioner against testifying in his defense at trial.\n(D.L 18-15) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment\non February 18, 2020. See generally Stephenson, 2020 WL 821418.\nOn July 6, 2020, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion (D.L 18-19) and.\non January 4, 2021, he filed the same Rule 61 motion with the Superior Court. See\nState V. Stephenson, 2021 WL 2211995, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. May 28, 2021). In\nthe motions, Petitioner argued that he was deprived of his right to decide whether\nto plead GBMI. Id. at *4. The Superior Court found the second (and third\nidentical) Rule 61 motion to be time-barred. Id. at *5. In addition, because\n^While his appeal was pending, the Delaware Supreme Court granted Petitioner\u2019s\nmotion to stay the appeal pending the results of  acompetency evaluation ordered\nby the Superior Court and until the Superior Court could determine whether\nPetitioner wanted to proceed pro se on appeal and remanded the case for an\nevidentiary hearing on those issues. (D.L 18-17 at 67-71) On remand, following\nevidence presented at a hearing that Petitioner was competent to represent himself,\nthe Superior Court concluded that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and\nintelligently decided that he wanted to be represented by counsel and rather than\nproceed pro se on his appeal. (D.L 18-14 at 317-319) Accordingly, on August 13,\n2019, the Delaware Supreme Court lifted the stay and ordered postconviction\ncounsel to continue to represent Petitioner on appeal. (D.L 18-17 at 72-73)\n8Petitioner raised claims that were known to him at the time of trial and outrightly\nrejected a GBMI plea, the Superior Court summarily dismissed his second\npostconviction motion because Petitioner failed to satisfy Rule 61\u2019s pleading\nrequirements for a successive Rule motion. Id. at *4-*5. In dismissing the motion,\nthe Superior Court found that Petitioner had failed to plead that any new evidence\nexisted that created a strong inference that he was actually innocent of the charges\nfor which he was convicted, or that there was a new rule of law made retroactive to\ncases on collateral review that would render his conviction invalid. Id. Petitioner\ndid not appeal.\nII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal\nsentences .. . and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal\ncourt may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground\nthat he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Additionally, AEDPA imposes procedural\nrequirements and standards for analyzing the merits of a habeas petition in order to\nprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state-court convictions are\n9given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 693\n(2002).\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999);\nPicard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\ncourt shall not be granted unless it appears that -\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in\nthe courts of the State; or\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such\nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of\ncomity, gives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues\nby invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review\nOSullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 process.\n(3dCir. 2000).\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\n10appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the\ncourt to consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451\nn.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised\nthe issue on direct appeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted\nand the petitioner does not need to raise the same issue again in a state post\u00ac\nconviction proceeding. See Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir.\n1997).\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and\nfurther state court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the\nfederal court will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted.\nSee Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[\nthe technical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer\navailable); see also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims.\nhowever, are procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v.\nLarkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a\nhabeas claim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly'\nrefuses to review the merits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state\nprocedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman,\n501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989).\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\n11unless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will\nresult if the court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172\nF.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. \\999)\\ Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause\nfor a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor\nexternal to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate\nactual prejudice, a petitioner must show that the errors during his trial created more\nthan a possibility of prejudice; he must show that the errors worked to his actual\nand substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional\ndimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that  a\u201cconstitutional violation has\n\u00bb3\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent. then a federal\ncourt can excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of\njustice exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means\nfactual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n614, 623 (1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual\n^Murray, All U.S. at 496.\n12innocence by asserting \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory\nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical\nevidence\u2014^that was not presented at trial,\u201d showing that no reasonable juror would\nhave voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Hubbard v.\nPinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nPetitioner\u2019s timely-filed Amended Petition'^ asserts the following three\nClaims: (1) the Superior Court violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to\nconfrontation by not allowing him to call Dr. Rushing to testily on his behalf (D.I.\n12 at 7-13; D.I. 17 at 2-7); (2) trial counsel created a conflict of interest, violated\nPetitioner\u2019s right to autonomy, and provided ineffective assistance during\nPetitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing when she asked the Superior Court to consider\nPetitioner as being guilty but mentally ill instead of presenting mitigating evidence\n(\u201clATC\u201d) (D.I. 12 at 14-20); and (3) trial counsel violated Petitioner\u2019s right to self\u00ac\nautonomy and provided ineffective assistance during Petitioner\u2019s bifurcated\n\u2018^On March 28, 2020, Petitioner filed a pro se Petition for habeas relief (D.I. 1) In\nhis AEDPA Election Form filed in January 2021, Petitioner indicated he wished to\namend his Petition within thirty days. (D.I. 11) On February 16, 2021, Petitioner\nfiled a document titled \u201cOpening Brief\u2019 presenting three claims for relief (D.I.\n12) After the State filed its Answer, Petitioner filed a document titled \u201cAmended\nPetition,\u201d which essentially supplements the three claims asserted in the Opening\nBrief filed in February 2021. (D.I. 17) Given these circumstances, the Court\nconstrues the two documents (D.I. 12; D.I. 17) as Petitioner\u2019s Amended Petition.\n13PFBPP bench trial by unilaterally deciding that Petitioner would not testify\nC\u2018IATC\u201d) (D.I. 12 at 21-27).\nA, Claim One: Superior Court Violated Petitioner\u2019s Constitutional\nRight To Call Witnesses By Not Permitting Dr. Rushing To Testify\nOn His Behalf\nPrior to Petitioner\u2019s trial, Dr. Rushing prepared  apsychiatric report for the\ndefense regarding Petitioner\u2019s mental health. (D.I. 18-14 at 83-94) The State filed\na motion to preclude Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony relating to the issue of self-defense.\n(D.I. 18-14 at 72-81) Trial counsel filed a response contending that the State\u2019s\nmotion should be denied. (D.I. 18-14 at 104-106) The Superior Court granted the\nState\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Rushing after concluding that the\ntestimony was inadmissible under Delaware Rule of Evidence 702 and because\nPetitioner had not complied with the notice requirement of Delaware Superior\nCourt Criminal Rule 16. (D.I. 18-14 at 136-150)\nIn Claim One, Petitioner argues that the Superior Court violated his\nconstitutional right to call witnesses by denying his request to have psychiatrist Dr.\nRushing testify on his behalf and also unreasonably determined the facts when it\nfound that Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony would not assist the trier of fact in resolving a\nfactual dispute. (D.I. 12 at 8) He contends that the Superior Court erred by not\nfinding that Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony was admissible under Delaware Rule of\nEvidence 702 because the testimony - when viewed in conjunction with his family\n14members\u2019 testimony - would have allowed the jury to determine a fact in issue,\nnamely, whether Petitioner \u201cwas actively suffering a mental health crisis\u201d at the\ntime of the shooting. (D.I. 12 at 9-12)\nIt is well-established that \u201c[sjtate courts are the ultimate expositors of state\n5\u20195\nand claims based on errors of state law are not cognizable on habeas review. law,\nEstelle V. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Therefore, to the extent Petitioner\ncontends the Superior Court committed an evidentiary error under Delaware law\nby not permitting Dr. Rushing to testify at trial, he has alleged an error of state law\nthat is not cognizable in this proceeding. See Keller v. Larkins, 251 F.3d 408, 416\nn. 2 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that the admissibility of evidence is generally a\nquestion of state law which is not cognizable under habeas review).\nTo the extent Petitioner contends that the Superior Court violated his right to\ncompulsory process^ by refusing to allow Dr. Rushing to testify on his behalf, the\nrecord reveals that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for this argument.\nAlthough Petitioner challenged the Superior Court\u2019s refusal to permit Dr.\n^Mullaneyv. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).\n^When presenting Claim One, Petitioner explicitly asserts that his \u201cright to call\nwitnesses\u201d was violated. (D.I. 12 at 5) Although the State construes Claim One as\nasserting a violation of Petitioner\u2019s right to confrontation (D.I. 20 at 20), the Court\nbelieves Claim One is more properly viewed as asserting a violation of Petitioner\u2019s\nright to compulsory process.\n15Rushing\u2019s testimony during his trial^ and to the Delaware Supreme Court on direct\nor postconviction appeal, he did not present that challenge as a compulsory process\nviolation. For instance, when opposing the State\u2019s motion to exclude Dr.\nRushing\u2019s testimony, defense counsel argued that Dr. Rushing should be permitted\nto testify because her expert testimony regarding Petitioner\u2019s mental state would\naid the jury in determining Petitioner\u2019s state of mind when the shooting occurred.\n(D.I. 18-14 at 105-106) After analyzing Dr. Rushing\u2019s report and proposed\ntestimony under Delaware Rule of Evidence 702, and referencing Delaware\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 16, the Superior Court granted the State\u2019s motion to\nexclude Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony. See State v. Stephenson, 2014 WL 2891626, at\n*2-5 (Del. Super. Ct. June 20, 2104).\nOn direct appeal. Petitioner argued that the Superior Court abused its\ndiscretion by denying his requests to present expert witness testimony from Dr.\nRushing. (D.I. 18-18 at 55-65) Petitioner challenged the Superior Court\u2019s decision\nas being unsupported by the facts and Dr. Rushing\u2019s report, asserting, \u201cwhile the\nSuperior Court stated that Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony was irrelevant and inadmissible\nbecause she did not specifically address his mental state on December 24, her\nreport plainly contradicts the Superior Court\u2019s finding: \u2018[Petitioner] was in a manic\nSee State v. Stephenson, 2014 WL 2891626, at *3-5 (Del. Super. Ct. June 20,\n2014).\n16(D.I. 18-17 at 61) Petitioner also argued that the state on Christmas Eve 2012.\nSuperior Court abused its discretion in \u201cfinding that Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony was\ninadmissible as a discovery violation under Criminal Rule 16\u201d because: (1)\ncontrary to the Superior Court\u2019s statement that the State lacked \u201cfair notice that Dr.\nRushing would testify about how his mental condition affected his perception of\nthe events on December 24,Dr. Rushing\u2019s report plainly states, among many((\nOther psychiatric observations concerning his mental condition, that, \u2018 [Petitioner\nwas in a manic state on Christmas Eve 2012\u2019\u201d (D.I. 18-17 at 61); and (2) the State\nnever raised or argued a discovery violation when it argued that Dr. Rushing\u2019s\ntestimony should be excluded (D.I. 18-17 at 61-62). The Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision to exclude Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony \u201con the\nbasis of the [Superior Court\u2019s] memorandum opinion dated June 20, 2014.\nStephenson, 2016 WL 3568170, at *1. In sum, this record reveals that Petitioner\ndid not assert, and neither the Superior Court nor the Delaware Supreme Court\nperceived, any federal due process issues concerning the issue of Dr. Rushing\u2019s\ntestimony when Petitioner challenged the exclusion of Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony\nduring his trial and on direct appeal.\nPetitioner also did not raise Claim One\u2019s federal compulsory process issue in\nhis Rule 61 proceedings. For instance, in his original pro se Rule 61 motion,\nPetitioner raised nine grounds for relief, one of which was an argument that the\n17Superior Court erred by denying his request to present the expert testimony of Dr.\nRushing to support his claim of self-defense. (D.L 18-14 at 25) The Superior\nCourt appointed postconviction counsel to represent Petitioner in his Rule 61\nproceeding. Postconviction counsel ended up filing an amended Rule 61 motion\npresenting only one of Petitioner\u2019s original nine pro se arguments, which was not\nthe compulsory process argument raised in Claim One of this proceeding. (D.L\n18-12 at 4-5) Petitioner also did not raise Claim One\u2019s compulsory process issue\nin his postconviction appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court after the denial of his\nfirst Rule 61 motion,^ nor did he raise the argument in his second and third Rule 61\nmotions. (D.L 18-19; D.L \\S-2l); see State v. Stephenson, 2021 WL 2211995, at\n4 (Del. Super. Ct. May 28, 2021).\nAt this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to raise Claim One in a new Rule\n61 motion would be barred as untimely under Delaware Superior Court Rule\n61(i)(l) and as second or successive under Rule 61(i)(2). See Del. Super. Ct. Crim.\nR. 61(i)(l) (establishing a one-year deadline for filing Rule 61 motions); Del.\nSuper. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(2) (providing that second or successive motions shall be\nsummarily dismissed unless they meet the pleading requirements of Rule\n61(d)(2)(i) or (ii)). Although Rule 61provides for an exception to its procedural\nbars if a Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly\n(D.L 18-15); see Stephenson, 2020 WL 821418, at *2.\n18recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is implicated in\nthe instant Claim. Similarly, the exceptions to the bars contained in Rule 61(i)(5)\nand (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner\u2019s case, because he does not allege actual\ninnocence, lack of jurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to\nClaim One. Therefore, the due process argument in Claim One is procedurally\ndefaulted, which means that the Court cannot review its merits absent a showing of\neither cause and prejudice or that a miscarriage of justice will result absent such\nreview.\nPetitioner attempts to establish cause for his default of the compulsory\nprocess argument in Claim One by blaming post-conviction counsel for failing to\nraise Claim One in his Rule 61 proceeding. In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1\n(2012), the Supreme Court held that inadequate assistance of counsel during an\ninitial-review state collateral proceeding may establish cause for a petitioner\u2019s\nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Id. at 16-17.\nIn order to obtain relief under Martinez, a petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) the\ndefaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is substantial; and (2) the\npost-conviction attorney in his first state collateral proceeding was ineffective\nunder the standards established in Strickland. See Workman v. Sup V Albion SCI,\n915 F.3d 928, 937 (3d Cir. 2019).\n19Claim One does not allege that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance\nbut, rather, alleges that the Superior Court violated Petitioner\u2019s right to compulsory\nprocess by excluding Dr. Rushing\u2019s testimony from his trial. Consequently, the\nextremely limited exception articulated in Martinez cannot be used to excuse\nPetitioner\u2019s default of Claim One.\nIn the absence of cause, the Court does not need to address the issue of\nprejudice. Nevertheless, the Court also finds that Petitioner has failed to\ndemonstrate prejudice. It is well-established that a criminal defendant has a\nconstitutional right to \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\nCrane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986) (\u201cWhether rooted directly in the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees\ncriminal defendants a \u2018meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019\u201d);\nsee also Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U.S. 505, 509 (2013). Part of this right is the\nability to present witnesses favorable to the defense theory of the case. See, e.g.,\nWashington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 18-19 (1967). Yet, \u201c[a] defendant's right to\npresent relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable\nrestrictions,\u201d such as evidentiary and procedural rules. United States v. Schejfer,\n523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998). \u201c[Sjtate and federal rule makers have broad latitude\n20\u00bb9\nunder the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials,\nand the Supreme Court has expressed its approval of \u201cwell-established rules of\nevidence\u201d that permit state trial judges to exclude evidence. Holmes v. South\nCarolina, 547 U.S. 319, 326 (2006); Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 53 (1996)\n(\u201c[T]he introduction of relevant evidence can be limited by the State for a \u2018valid\u2019\nreason.\u201d). \u201cSuch rules do not abridge an accused's right to present a defense so\nlong as they are not \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they are\nScheffer, 523 U.S. at 308. A rule is \u201carbitrary\u201d where it designed to serve.1 ??\nexclude[s] important defense evidence but... [does] not serve any legitimate\nWJell established rules of evidence permit interests. Holmes, 547 U.S. at 325.t4r\ntrial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain\nother factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to\nmislead the jury.\u201d Id. at 326-37. \u201cOnly rarely [has the United States Supreme\nCourt] held that the right to present a complete defense was violated by the\nexclusion of defense evidence under a state rule of evidence.\u201d Jackson, 569 U.S. at\n509. The Supreme Court has found \u201cthe exclusion of evidence to be\nunconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a\nweighty interest of the accused.\u201d Scheffer, 523 U.S. at 308.\nMackson,569 U.S. at 509.\n21Here, the Superior Court ruled that Dr. Rushing could not testify under\nD.R.E. 702\u2019s helpfulness standard because \u201cnothing in Dr. Rushing\u2019s report\naddress [ed] how [Petitioner] perceived events on December 24 and therefore her\ntestimony will not assist the trier of fact on this issue. Indeed, Dr. Rushing\nseemingly disavows any attempt to relate [Petitioner\u2019s] mental condition to his\nperception of those events - she states in her report that \u201c[i]f [Petitioner] presents a\ndefense of self-defense at trial, [his] mental illness is unlikely to be relevant to such\na defense.\u201d Stephenson, 2014 WL 2891626, at *4. Given Dr. Rushing\u2019s explicit\nstatement discounting the relevance between Petitioner\u2019s mental illness and the\nissue of self-defense, the Court concludes that the Superior Court did not\nunreasonably determine the facts when granting the State\u2019s motion, nor did the\nSuperior Court\u2019s decision violate Petitioner\u2019s right to compulsory process.\nAdditionally, Petitioner has not satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception\nto the procedural default doctrine because he has not provided new reliable\nevidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny the due\nprocess/confrontation clause argument in Claim One as procedurally barred.\nB. Claim Two: lATC During Sentencing\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective\nassistance at sentencing by not calling witnesses to offer mitigation evidence\nregarding his mental illness. Petitioner also asserts that trial counsel was operating\n22under a conflict of interest and/or violated his right to self-autonomy during\nsentencing because trial counsel\u2019s pursuit of the guilty but mentally ill (\u201cGBMI\u201d)\nissue contradicted Petitioner\u2019s continued assertion of self-defense. (D.I. 17 at 8)\nSpecifically, Petitioner argues that, by focusing on presenting a GBMI defense\nduring sentencing and failing to offer mitigation evidence consisting of Dr. Selig\u2019s\nreport diagnosing Petitioner with \u201cBorderline Intellectual Functioning\u201d and\nevidence of Petitioner\u2019s noncompliance with treatment, trial counsel failed to\nsubject the State\u2019s case to any meaningful adversarial testing. (D.I. 12 at 16-19)\nPetitioner also states that trial counsel should have known that the judge could not\ndecide if Petitioner was GBMI once the jury returned a guilty verdict. (D.I. 12 at\n14)\nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not present the instant lATC argument\nto the Delaware Supreme Court on direct appeal or on appeal from the denial of his\nRule 61 motions. At this point in time, any attempt by Petitioner to pursue relief\nby filing a new Rule 61 motion containing this argument and appealing that\ndecision would be time-barred by Rule 61(1) and barred for being successive under\nRule 61(i)(2). Again, since none of the exceptions to Rule 61(i)(l) and (2)\u2019s bars\ncontained in Rule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) apply. Claim Two is procedurally defaulted.\nConsequently, the Court cannot review Claim Two on the merits absent a showing\nof cause and prejudice, or a miscarriage of justice.\n23Petitioner attempts to establish cause by relying on the Martinez exception to\nthe procedural default rule and alleging that his default was caused by\npostconviction counsel\u2019s failure to include Claim Two in his first Rule 61 motion.\nThis argument is unavailing. The Martinez exception to procedural default applies\nonly where the petitioner demonstrates ineffective assistance by postconviction\ncounsel, and that the underlying lATC claim is \u201csubstantial.\u201d To satisfy the first\nMartinez requirement, a petitioner must only show that postconviction counsel's\nperformance was deficient under the first prong of the Strickland standard, /.e..\nthat his state postconviction counsel's performance fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness.\u201d Workman^ 915 F.3d at 941.\nTo satisfy the second Martinez requirement (that the underlying lATC claim\nis substantial), a petitioner must show the claim has \u201csome merit\u201d under the\nstandard applicable to certificates of appealability. See Gaines v. Sup\u2019t Benner\nTownship, SCI, 33 F.4**^ 705, 711 (3d Cir. 2022). In other words, \u201ca petitioner must\n\u2018show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that)\nthe petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues\npresented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. Workman,\n915 F.3d at 938 {quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003)). This\nis a light burden; [a petitioner] must show only that his claim represents something\nmore than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith. Gaines, 33\n24F.4th at 711 (3d Cir. 2022). When making the threshold \u201csome\nmerit/substantiality\u201d determination, the Court must \u201cremain[ ] mindful that the\n\u2018substantiality\u2019 inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal\nbases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d Preston v. Sup't Graterford SCI, 902 F.3d\n365, 377 (3d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up); see also Bey v. Siip't Greene SCI, 856 F.3d\n230, 238 (3d Cir. 2017) (\u201c[W]hether [an ineffective assistance of counsel] claim is\nsubstantial is a threshold inquiry that does not require full consideration of the\nfactual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d) (cleaned up).\n1, Ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel\nIt is axiomatic that the Martinez rule cannot be utilized to excuse the default\nof an lATC claim unless the default was due to postconviction counsel\u2019s failure to\npresent the claim in the petitioner\u2019s initial-review state collateral proceeding. See\nMartinez, 566 U.S. at 16-17. Here, although Petitioner was represented by counsel\nin his first Rule 61 proceeding who filed an amended Rule 61 motion asserting one\nground for relief, Petitioner sought, and was permitted, an opportunity to present\ntwo additional grounds for relief * * (D.I. 18-12 at 12-13; D.L 18-14 at 276,\n^^^Petitioner could have sought permission to present Claim Two\u2019s lATC argument\nin his Rule 61 motion at the same time he sought to present the other two claims\nfor relief\nPetitioner asserted two pro se claims on postconviction appeal: (1) trial counsel\nwas ineffective for not requesting a competency hearing and (2) the SuperiorII\n25284-86, 289-90, 303-308, 315-16) The grounds for relief that Petitioner asserted in\nhis Rule 61 appeal after postconviction counsel moved to withdraw from\nrepresenting Petitioner under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 26(c) did not present\n12\nthe lATC argument in Claim Two. See Stephenson, 2020 WL 821418, at *2.\nIn short, since Petitioner could have, but did not, present Claim Two in his\ninitial collateral proceeding and on post-conviction appeal, he cannot utilize\nMartinez as a method of avoiding his default of Claim Two.\n2. Claim Two is not a substantial lATC claim\nPetitioner also cannot rely on Martinez to avoid his procedural because\nClaim Two\u2019s lATC argument is not substantial. At sentencing, the State argued\nthat Petitioner should be sentenced to life for second degree murder because of his\nviolent criminal history (two prior felony assaults), repetitive criminal conduct.\nlack of remorse, accountability or amenability to lesser sanctions, and undue\ndepreciation of the offense. (D.I. 19-8 at 5-7) Trial counsel argued that Petitioner\nwas diagnosed as bipolar and schizophrenic at the age of ten, his mother was\nschizophrenic and his grandparents, who took over his care, were unable to\nproperly care for him. (D.I. 19-8 at 20) Trial counsel emphasized that Petitioner\nCourt committed judicial error by not sua sponte holding a competency hearing.\n(D.I. 18-12 at 12-13; D.I. 18-14 at 276, 284-86, 289-90, 303-308, 315-16)\n\u2018^The sole ground Petitioner presented for the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s\nconsideration was an lATC claim alleging that trial counsel was ineffective for\nadvising him against testifying in his defense at trial. {See D.I. 18-15)\n26loved his sister and her son and he was sorry because they now must live without\nthe victim. (D.I. 19-8 at 21-22) Trial counsel mentioned that Petitioner was taking\nRisperdol and Depakote, psychotropic medications, and that while incarcerated, he\nwas under psychiatric care. (D.I. 19-8 at 22) Trial counsel stated that Petitioner\nbelieved that the victim could have killed him because the victim was a drug\ndealer, had a violent history, and Petitioner had seen him with guns. (D.I. 19-8 at\n23) Petitioner also dealt drugs for the victim, but had not paid the victim the\nmoney he owed him at the time of the victim\u2019s death, which was what he and the\nvictim were discussing that night. (D.I. 19-8 at 24-25) Trial counsel added that, for\nmore than a year, she and Petitioner extensively discussed the subject of Petitioner\ntestifying, and she eventually advised him not to testify because his assault history\nand version of events where he admitted selling drugs would be placed before the\njury. (D.I. 19-8 at 24-25)\nDuring the sentencing hearing, trial counsel admitted that she could not find\nany legal support for asking the Superior Court to consider GBMI at sentencing.\nbut she asked for the GBMI designation hoping that Petitioner would obtain mental\nhealth treatment, which she doubted he would receive in prison. (D.I. 19-8 at 26,\n29-32) Counsel added that Petitioner\u2019s mental illness issues - paranoid.\nschizophrenic, and bipolar - did not preclude a finding that he acted in self-\ndefense. (D.I. 19-8 at 26-27) Counsel stated that due to his learning disability,\n27Petitioner presented with a child-like affect and that when he is on medication,\nPeterson was \u201cvery docile, eager to please.\u201d (D.L 19-8 at 34-35) Trial counsel\nasked the court \u201cto please consider that there has been a mental health history and\nto put that in context,\u201d sentence Petitioner to thirty years, and order that he be\nprovided with mental health treatment. Counsel further acknowledged that\nPetitioner did not want to be found GBMI because someday he wanted \u201cto go to\nGander Hill or a similar facility.\u201d (D.I. 19-8 at 28, 38-40)\nPetitioner told the Superior Court that he was sorry for what he put his\nfamily through, but he killed the victim in self-defense. (D.I. 19-8 at 40-41)\nPetitioner said that the Bible teaches forgiveness, he prayed for everyone, and he\nmissed the victim too. (D.I. 19-8 at 41-42) Petitioner then stated that he would not\nwant to replace his attorney even though they did not always see \u201ceye-to-eye,'\nexplaining that he knew that she was doing the best she could for him. (D.I. 19-8\nat 42-44) Petitioner only complained that he had not received all of his Rule 16\ndiscovery, which trial counsel denied stating they had sent it to him at least three\ntimes. (D.I. 19-8 at 42-44)\nThe Superior Court then stated to trial counsel, \u201cI have throughout the\ncourse of this litigation, observed your zeal, and your efforts on behalf of your\nclient, and I have been very impressed by them; and I have zero doubt that you\nhave done anything other than your best, and that you have provided your client\n28with all of the materials that you have received, and I\u2019m confident about that.\n(D.I. 19-8 at 44)\nPrior to imposing sentence, the Superior Court explained:\nI have reviewed the - the psychiatric - well, I\u2019ve\nreviewed the entire file thoroughly, but in\nparticular, I have placed a lot of emphasis on the\npsychiatric reports here, and in - I find that all of\nthem are helpful, but one I wanted to focus on for a\nmoment was the report prepared by [Petitioner\u2019s'\npsychologist, Dr. Rushing.\nDr. Rushing said that, and I agree with this - that\n\u201cwhen [Petitioner discontinues his medications, his\nsymptoms, including psychosis and mania,\nincrease in severity. When psychotic or manic, he\nhas been documented to react in a physically\nviolent manner on multiple occasions.\u201d\n\"What worries me is that I see little, if any, prospect\nthat [Petitioner] will ever be reliable to take\nmedications and to avoid that. Dr. Rushing, for\nexample, noted that\nchilling - that [Petitioner] does not believe he is ill.\nPetitioner] has, in Dr. Rushing\u2019s view, very little\ninsight into his mental illness.and this is particularly\nThere have been documented times, according to\nDr. Rushing and according to the file, that when\nnot incarcerated or not under the care of DPC,\nPetitioner] has previously discontinued his\nmedications. In fact, shortly before these events,\napparently his sister had thought that [Petitioner\nhad discontinued his medications.\nI looked through the file, and I\nadministrative warrant dated August 11th of 2011,saw an\n29in which there was a violation of probation, and\nthe events describing that warrant were not, by\nthemselves, particularly chilling, until you\nconsider how violent a man he becomes when he -\nwhen he doesn\u2019t take medications.\nFor example, [Petitioner] - and this is in 2010 -\nmissed appointments for community mental health\non September 28th, October 12th, and November\n19th, even though he had been ordered to make\nthose appointments by the Mental Health Court.\nHe had positive urine screens for Marijuana, and\nagain, there was a history not reported - in this\nparticular administrative warrant, but there\u2019s a\ndocumented history that he - he simply did not\ntake his medications except when forced to do so.\nIn fact, there are reports in the file that at times, he\nhas been forced to, by prison authorities, to take\nhis medications, because he won\u2019t voluntarily do\nso when asked by prison authorities.\nHis history, criminal history, shows an escalating\nlevel of violence. In 2000, there are arrests for\nTerroristic Threatening and menacing, fighting,\nAssault in the Third Degree. In 2004, there was an\narrest for threatening a victim, and then another\none for Possession with intent to Deliver Within\n300 feet of a Park. That, by itself, I don\u2019t think\nshows a propensity for violence, but then again in\n2005, there was a Terroristic Threatening.\nIn 2007, there was a Terroristic Threatening. In\n2007, an Assault in a Detention Facility. There was\nan assault on a correctional officer.\nIn 2008, there was a stalking with threats, as well\nas Terroristic Threats, and yet again, in 2010, there\n30was another Assault in a Detention Facility on a\nState Officer.\nWhen you look at this record, you see the sort of\nlevel of violence, coupled with the mental illness\nthat he seems to suffer, coupled with his refusal to\ntake medications. It seems almost inevitably that a\ntragedy such as this was going to occur. It\u2019s sad\nbeyond belief that it occurred but the signs were,\nfrankly, all there.\nI am sympathetic and I understand that [Petitioner\nsuffers from a disease that he didn\u2019t ask to have,\nbut I am also convinced that he has chosen not to\ntake his medications which he knows are necessary\nto prevent him from harming others, and I have\nseen little, if any, likelihood that he will ever\nvoluntarily take those medications. I think, for the\nrest of his life, that [Petitioner] will be a threat to\nwhoever he is around, unless he is taking\nmedications, and I see little\nindication, if any, of the extensive records that I\u2019ve\nread, that [Petitioner] could be relied upon to take\nmedications if he were unsupervised; and there is\nno indication whatsoever that there is any\npossibility, let alone likelihood, that in the future\nhe will develop the ability to take medications and\nthat some day in the future he may be relied upon\nto take his medications.there is no\nI am steadfastly against punishing an individual\nbecause of a disease. I don\u2019t think I am punishing\nPetitioner] because he has a disease, because I am\nsatisfied that he had the ability to control this and\nchose not to do so.\nThere comes a point in time when I must protect\nsociety and others, and when that interest becomes\nparamount, and this is one of those, because I am\n31convinced [Petitioner] will pose a threat to some\ninnocent person the minute he gets out of custody;\nand I see, as I say, little likelihood or little\npossibility that he will change in the future.\n(D.L 19-8 at 45-51)\nPetitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present\nDr. Selig\u2019s report at sentencing because it diagnosed him as having \u201cborderline\nintellectual function\u201d (\u201cBIF\u201d) and would have helped demonstrate that he did not\nhave the ability to be compliant with his medication regimen. (D.L 12 at 17-18)\nHe argues that his failure to routinely take his medication in the past was due to the\ncombined effect of BIF and schizophrenia and not, as he asserts the Superior Court\nbelieved, because he chose not to be compliant. (D.L 12 at 17-18)\nStrickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of\nmitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the\ndefendant at sentencing. Nor does Strickland require defense counsel to present\nmitigating evidence at sentencing in every case.\u201d Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 533.\nStrickland only requires a reasonable investigation.\nThe foregoing excerpt from Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing demonstrates\nthat the Superior Court extensively considered the psychiatric reports contained in\nPetitioner\u2019s record when determining his sentence and, although the Superior Court\nonly explicitly referenced Dr. Rushing\u2019s report, Petitioner has not demonstrated\n32that Dr. Selig\u2019s report was not one of the other psychiatric reports considered by\nthe court. Additionally, Dr. Rushing\u2019s report refers to Dr. Selig\u2019s 2006 and 2010\ndiagnosis of Petitioner as having \u201cborderline intellectual function,\u201d and also\nexplains that BIF \u201cis a diagnosis that indicates an IQ in the range of 70-85.\u201d (D.I.\n13 at 5- 29) Finally, contrary to Petitioner\u2019s assertion, the Superior Court\u2019s\nconsideration of Petitioner\u2019s noncompliance in taking his medication was not so\nmuch focused on whether Petitioner willfully chose not to take his medication but,\nrather, on the fact that Petitioner was more compliant with his medication regimen\nwhen supervised. For instance, the Superior Court explained that \u201cthere is no\nindication, if any, of the extensive records that I\u2019ve read, that [Petitioner] could be\nrelied upon to take medications if he were unsupervised.\u201d (D.I. 19-8 at 51) Given\nthese circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that trial counsel\u2019s failure to\nindependently highlight Dr. Selig\u2019s BIF diagnosis prejudiced Petitioner.\nTo the extent Petitioner contends trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\ncall witnesses at sentencing, Petitioner does not identify the witnesses he believes\nshould have been called, the testimony they would have provided, or that the\nwitnesses would have been available to testify. To the extent the mental health\nexperts who authored the aforementioned psychiatric reports are the potential\nwitnesses to which Petitioner refers. Petitioner has not identified the testimony\nthey would have provided or how their testimony would have added to the\n33diagnoses presented in their reports. Consequently, for all these reasons, the Court\nconcludes that the lATC allegation in Claim Two lacks \u201csome merit.\nAnd finally. Petitioner\u2019s argument that trial counsel represented him while\noperating under a conflict of interest and/or violated Petitioner\u2019s right to self\u00ac\nautonomy by presenting the GBMI issue during sentencing against Petitioner\u2019s\nwishes does not transform Claim Two into a substantial ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim. A Sixth Amendment conflict of interest claim is treated as a special\ntype of ineffective assistance of counsel claim, because prejudice will be presumed\nif the attorney actively represented conflicted interests that adversely affected\nhis/her performance. See Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980). To prevail\non an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on a conflict of interest, a\npetitioner \u201cmust establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his\nlawyer's performance.\u201d Id. An actual conflict of interest arises when \u201ctrial\ncounsel's interests and the defendants' interests diverge[ ] with respect to a material\nfactual or legal issue or to a course of action.\u201d Government of Virgin Islands v.\nZepp, 748 F.2d 125, 135 (3d Cir. 1984). As explained by the Third Circuit, an\nactual conflict\u201d arising from defense counsel's active representation of conflicting\ninterests is established by showing (1) some plausible alternative defense strategy\nmight have been pursued, and (2) the alternative defense was inherently in conflict\nwith or not undertaken due to the attorney's other loyalties or interests. See United\n34States V. MorellU 169 F.3d 798, 810 (3d Cir. 1999). Tlhe conflict must cause\nsome lapse in representation contrary to the defendant's interests ... [which] can be\ndemonstrated not only by what the attorney does, but by what he refrains from\ndoing.\u201d Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 173 (2002). However, courts must keep\nin mind the principle that \u201cdefense counsel is in the best position to determine if a\nconflict exists.\u201d Id. at 167-68. In this case, if trial counsel and Petitioner\ndisagreed about presenting the GBMI issue during sentencing - which is not\nindicated in the sentencing transcript - that disagreement over legal strategy does\nnot amount to an actual conflict of interest under the Sixth Amendment.\nNor did trial counsel\u2019s presentation of the GBMI issue during sentencing\ndeprive Petitioner of his right to self-autonomy. In McCoy v. Louisiana, 138 S. Ct\n1500 (2018), the Supreme Court held that criminal defendants \u201cmust be allowed to\nmake [their] own choices about the proper way to protect [their] liberty,\u201d which\nincludes the right to \u201cinsist on maintaining innocence at the guilt phase.\u201d Id. at\n1508. When counsel does not allow a defendant to maintain his innocence, the\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment rights are violated. Id. Importantly, in this case.\ntrial counsel did not present a GBMI defense against Petitioner\u2019s wishes at trial.\nInstead, trial counsel maintained Petitioner\u2019s innocence and presented a theory of\nself-defense. (SeeD.l. 18-14 at 107-108) At sentencing, Petitioner had been\nfound guilty, trial counsel made a strategic decision to present the GBMI issue in\n35an attempt to ensure that Petitioner would receive the appropriate mental health\ntreatment during incarceration.\nFor all these reasons, the Court finds that Petitioner has failed to demonstrate\nthat Claim Two asserts a substantial claim of ineffective assistance. The absence\nof cause obviates the need to address the issue of prejudice. Additionally, the\nmiscarriage of justice exception is inapplicable because Petitioner has not asserted\nnew reliable evidence of his actual innocence.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two as procedurally barred.\nC. Claim Three: lATC During Bifurcated Bench Trial For PFBPP\nIn Claim Three, Petitioner asserts that trial counsel provided ineffective\nassistance during his bifurcated bench trial for PFBPP and deprived Petitioner of\nhis right to self-autonomy by waiving Petitioner\u2019s right to testify. (D.I. 12 at 21,\n23) Petitioner did not present Claim Three to the Superior Court in any of his Rule\n61 motions or to the Delaware Supreme Court on direct appeal or on\npostconviction appeal from the denial of any of Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motions. For\nthe same reasons discussed with respect to Claim Two, Petitioner is unable to\npursue further review of Claim Three in the Delaware state courts, which means\nthat Claim Three is procedurally defaulted. See supra at Section II.B.\nPetitioner also unsuccessfully invokes the Martinez rule to establish cause\nfor his default of Claim Three. First, the fact that Petitioner could have, but did\n36not, present Claim Three in his supplement to postconviction counsel\u2019s reply brief\nin his initial Rule 61 proceeding and in his post-conviction appeal from that\nproceeding precludes him from utilizing Martinez as a method of avoiding his\ndefault of Claim Three. Second, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the\nunderlying lATC argument in Claim Three is substantial. On June 24, 2014,\nPetitioner signed a stipulated waiver of jury trial in which he confirmed his\nunderstanding of the rights he was waiving in electing a bench trial on the\nbifurcated PFBPP charge. (D.L 18-2 at Entry No. 2) On January 12, 2015,\nPetitioner voluntarily waived his right to testify at trial on the murder and related\ncharges. (D.L 19-6 at 27-29) That same day (January 12, 2015), after the jury\nretired for deliberations in the murder trial, the bifurcated PFBPP case proceeded\nto a stipulated bench trial. (D.L 19-6 at 35) When the bench trial began, trial\ncounsel only conceded that Petitioner had a prior felony conviction that made him\na person prohibited. (D.L 19-6 at 35) The State submitted a certified copy of\nPetitioner\u2019s prior felony assault conviction and then both the State and trial counsel\nincorporated by reference the attorneys\u2019 statements and evidence as they were\nsubmitted to the jury in the murder trial. (D.L 19-6 at 35-36) The Superior Court\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner was guilty of PFBPP because he\npossessed a firearm when he shot Ashley. (D.L 19-6 at 36)\n37Petitioner acknowledges that he knowingly decided to not testify in his\nrelated murder trial and that he agreed to a bifurcated bench trial for his PFBPP\ncharge. Importantly, Petitioner signed the stipulation for a bench trial in order to\neliminate the need for live testimony. (D.L 19-6 at 36) Aside from the stipulation\nthat Petitioner was a person prohibited, the sole issue before the Superior Court in\nthe subsequent bifurcated PFBPP trial was whether Petitioner possessed the\nfirearm and shot Ashley. Yet, as trial counsel admitted during her opening\nstatement in the murder trial, the murder trial testimony showed that Petitioner\npossessed a firearm and shot Ashley. (D.I. 19-1 at 14-15)\nHere, Petitioner makes the unsupported argument that trial counsel\nunilaterally decided that he would not testify in the bifurcated bench trial.\nPetitioner has not alleged that he requested to testify in his bench trial and.\nimportantly, the Court notes that the bifurcated bench trial immediately followed\nthe jury trial on the related murder charge, where Petitioner, in a colloquy, stated\nhe did not wish to testify. Petitioner also has not alleged what he would have\npresented to the Superior Court through his testimony that would have led to an\nacquittal on the PFBPP charge. Consequently, the Court cannot conclude that trial\ncounsel performed deficiently or that Petitioner was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to challenge the State\u2019s case or request that the Superior Court engage in a\nseparate colloquy regarding Petitioner\u2019s decision whether to testify at the\n38bifurcated bench trial. Given these circumstances, the Court finds that Petitioner\u2019s\nprocedurally defaulted lATC argument in Claim Three is not substantial and,\ntherefore, does not constitute cause for his default.\nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice.\nAdditionally, the miscarriage of justice exception does not apply in this case.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Three as procedurally barred.\nD. Pending Motions\nPetitioner filed the following Motions during the pendency of this case: (1)\nMotion for \u00a7 2253 Appeal (D.I. 39); (2) Motion to Appoint Counsel (D.I. 40); and\n(3) Amended Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing (D.I. 45). The Court construes\nthe Motion for \u00a7 2253 Appeal to be a Motion to Supplement the Petition because it\nessentially reasserts and/or supplements the three Claims for relief presented in his\nPetition. So construed, the Court will grant the Motion. (D.I. 39) The Court\nfurther notes that it has considered the supplemental information when reviewing\nand deciding to deny the instant Petition.\nIn turn, given the Court\u2019s determination that the three Claims in the Petition\ndo not warrant relief, the Court will dismiss as moot Petitioner\u2019s Motion to\nAppoint Counsel (D.I. 40) and his Amended Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing\n(D.I. 45).\n39IV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\nA district court issuing a final order denying a  \u00a72254 petition must also\ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2\n(2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when\na petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by\ndemonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of\nthe constitutional claims debatable or wrong. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); also\nSlack V. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). In addition, when a district court\ndenies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying\nconstitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability\nunless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1)\nwhether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and\n(2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling. See Slack v. McDaniel,\n529 U.S. 473,484 (2000).\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief.\nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly,\nthe Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n40V. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition must\nbe denied without an evidentiary hearing or the issuance of a certificate of\nappealability. An appropriate Order will be entered.\n41"}
