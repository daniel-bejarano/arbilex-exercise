Larson, DLA PIPER \nLLP, Wilmington , DE; \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nJuly 19, 2022 Before me is the issue of claim construction of\"remote\" in U.S. Patent No. 7,753,273 (\"the \n'273 Patent\"). I have considered the parties' joint briefing and letters filed thereafter. (D.I. 80, \n95 (parties agreeing to constructions for \"diverter\" and \"diverting\" in the asserted claims of U.S. \nPatent No. 8,096,471), 96, 97). I held a claim construction hearing on July 1, 2022. \nI. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ( en bane) ( cleaned up). \"There is no magic formula or catechism for conducting \nclaim construction. Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate weight to appropriate sources \nin light of the statutes and policies that inform patent law.\" Soft View LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL \n4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (cleaned up). When construing patent claims, a court \nconsiders the literal language of the claim, the patent specification , and the prosecution history. \nMarkman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, \n517 U.S. 370 (1996). Of these sources, \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim \nconstruction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1315 ( cleaned up). \n\"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning ... [ which \nis] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the \ntime of the invention , i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application .\" Id at 1312-13 \n( cleaned up). \"The ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after \nreading the entire patent.\" Id at 13 21 ( cleaned up). \"In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim \nlanguage as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, \n2 and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely \naccepted meaning of commonly understood words.\" Id. at 1314. \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evidence-the patent claims, the specification , \nand the prosecution history-the court's construction is a determination oflaw. See Teva Pharm. \nUSA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318,331 (2015). The court may also make factual findings \nbased upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \"consists of all evidence external to the \npatent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries, and learned \ntreatises.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317-19 (cleaned up). Extrinsic evidence may assist the court in \nunderstanding the underlying technology , the meaning of terms to one skilled in the art, and how \nthe invention works. Id. Extrinsic evidence, however, is less reliable and less useful in claim \nconstruction than the patent and its prosecution history. Id. \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe '273 and '471 Patents describe voting machines. '273 Patent, 2:24-38; '471 Patent, \n2:3-35. The '273 patent application was filed on June 4, 2003, and the '471 patent application was \nfiled on December 17, 2008. The '471 Patent shares portions of the '273 Patent's specification. \nThe parties filed a Joint Claim Construction Brief on May 27, 2022, disputing the \nconstructions of \"remote\" from the '273 Patent and \"diverter\" and \"diverting\" from the '471 \nPatent. (DJ. 80). On June 23, 2022, I issued an Order providing proposed constructions for these \nterms and requesting that the parties meet and confer. (DJ. 88). After meeting, the parties agreed \nto a construction for the \"diverter\" and \"diverting\" terms. (DJ. 95). The Parties could not agree \nregarding how \"remote\" should be construed , however, and provided updated proposed \nconstructions for this term. (DJ. 96, 97). \n3 \"Remote\" appears in asserted claim 4 of the '273 Patent, where claim 4 is dependent on \nclaim 1. The parties agree that claim 4 is representative for purposes of this dispute. (D.I. 80 at \n2). Claims 1 and 4 read: \n1. A method of voting that allows a voter to navigate a plurality of contests and a plurality \nof options associated with each of said contests, said method comprising: \nproviding a navigation device comprising a center push button switch, a first pair \nof push-button switches positioned above and below said center push-button \nswitch, and a second pair of push-button switches positioned left and right of said \ncenter push-button switch; \npresenting said contests and said associated options to the voter, wherein one of \nsaid first and second pairs of push button switches enables the voter to scroll among \nsaid contests, and wherein the other of said first and second pairs of push-button \nswitches enables the voter to scroll among said options; and \nreceiving a plurality of voting selections from the voter, wherein said center push\u00ad\nbutton switch enables the voter to make at least one voting selection for each of \nsaid contests by selecting at least one of said options without providing any input \non other of said options. \n4. The method of claim 1 wherein said navigation device includes one or more auxiliary \npush-button switches located remote from said first and second pairs of push-button \nswitches and said center push-button switch. \n('273 Patent, 18:14-33, 18:42-45 (disputed term bolded and italicized) ). \nIII. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERM \nA. \"remote\" ('273 Patent, Cl. 4) \nl. Plaintiff's proposed construction: \"Distinctly spaced apart.\" \n2. Defendant's proposed construction: \"Distant in space.\" \n3. Court's construction : \"Distant in space.\" \nAfter considering the Parties' Joint Claim Construction Brief, I proposed that \"remote\" be \nconstrued to mean \"distant in space.\" (D.I. 88). Defendant agrees with the Court's proposed \n4 construction. (D.I. 97). Plaintiff disagrees and argues that \"remote\" should be construed to mean \n\"distinctly spaced apart.\" (D.I. 96). \nThe parties' dispute centers around how far the \"auxiliary push-button switches\" \n(hereinafter \"auxiliary buttons\") must be from the \"first and second pairs of push-button switches \nand [the] center push-button switch\" (hereinafter \"primary buttons\") to be considered remote. \nPlaintiff argues that \"distant\" as it is used in the Court's proposed construction \"may be \nconfusing to a juror who might mistakenly think that 'distant' requires a very large distance \nbetween the two sets of buttons\" when, instead, claim 4 requires that the auxiliary buttons and \nprimary buttons \"must be part of the same 'navigation device.\"' (D.I. 96 at 1-2 ( quoting '273 \nPatent, 18:42-45 (claim 4 requiring \"wherein said navigation device includes .... \"))). Plaintiff \ninstead proposes \"distinctly spaced apart\" because \"[t]his definition requires spacing between the \ntwo groups of buttons, but not so much as to render the spacing requirement unreasonably large \nfor the covered claim term.\" (Id. at 2). Defendant disagrees , arguing that Plaintiffs proposed \nconstruction \"distinctly spaced apart\" is ambiguous and would \"encompass the same prior art \nPlaintiff distinguished during ... prior IPR proceedings. \" (D.I. 97 at 1 (citing D.I. 80 at 13-14, 31-\n33)). \nThe term \"remote\" does not appear in the '273 Patent's specification. Yet, the parties agree \nthat Figures 19 and 20 of the '273 Patent provide embodiments of auxiliary buttons that are \n\"remote\" from primary buttons. (D.I. 80 at 3-4, 12-13). These figures depict a voting machine \nwith an auxiliary button sub-panel located on the opposite side of a voting machine from a primary \nbutton sub-panel. ('273 Patent, Figures 19-20). \nThe parties do not argue that the prosecution history informs how an ordinarily skilled \nartisan would have understood the term \"remote.\" The '273 Patent was subject to inter partes \n5 review (\"IPR\"), however, where the Plaintiff overcame a prior art reference including rows of \nequidistantly spaced buttons by arguing that the bottom row of buttons did not include auxiliary \nbuttons that were remote from upper rows of primary buttons because buttons that are equidistantly \nspaced cannot be remote from each other; Plaintiff emphasized that, \"'remoteness is important so \nthat the voter does not confuse the auxiliary push-button switches with those in the [upper rows] \nand so might push a button inadvertentl y.\"' (D.I. 81 at Appx00131 (Patent Trial and Appeal \nBoard's Final Written Decision affirming the validity of claim 4) (quoting Patent Owner's \n(Plaintiffs) expert witness)); see also Aylus Networks, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 856 F.3d 1353, 1361 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017) (\"Because an IPR proceeding involves reexamination of an earlier administrative \ngrant of a patent, it follows that statements made by a patent owner during an IPR proceeding can \nbe considered during claim construction and relied upon to support a finding of prosecution \ndisclaimer.\"). \nConsidering the intrinsic evidence, I do not agree that \"remote\" should be construed to \nmean \"distinctly spaced apart,\" as this construction adds unnecessary ambiguity and would \nencompass navigation devices that are outside the scope of the claimed invention. For example, \nimagine a keypad including primary buttons that are equidistantl y spaced one inch apart. If this \nkeypad further included auxiliary buttons located half of an inch from the primary buttons, these \nauxiliary buttons would be \"distinctly spaced apart\" from the primary buttons, but I do not agree \nthat they would be remote. Instead, considering the intrinsic record, a person of ordinary skill in \nthe art would have understood \"remote\" auxiliary buttons to be those that are further separated \nfrom the primary buttons. \nRejecting Plaintiffs proposed construction , I find that \"remote\" should be construed to \nmean \"distant in space.\" After considering the intrinsic evidence and in an accordance with the \n6 word's well-understood meaning, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have understood \n\"remote\" to define a significant spatial separation between the primary and auxiliary buttons. This \nis consistent with the teachings of the specification related to Figures 19 and 20, showing auxiliary \nbuttons that are \"distant in space\" from the primary buttons. ('273 Patent, Figures 19-20). This is \nalso consistent with Plaintiffs expert's statements during the IPR that auxiliary buttons that are \nremote from primary buttons must be sufficientl y spaced as to avoid confusion or inadvertent \npressing. (D.I. 81 at Appx131 ; see also Fenner Invs., Ltd. v. Cellco P'ship, 778 F.3d 1320, 1323 \n(Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"Any explanation , elaboration , or qualification presented by the inventor during \npatent examination is relevant, for the role of claim construction is to capture the scope of the \nactual invention that is disclosed , described , and patented. \") (cleaned up)). But at what spacing \nwould a person of ordinary skill have understood the remote buttons to be \"distant in space\"? This \nis not a question for claim construction , but a factual question on which the experts may offer their \nop1mons. \nFurther, while Plaintiff expresses concern that \"distant in space\" could be misunderstood \nby the jury to require a very large distance that conflicts with the claim requirement that the \nprimary and remote buttons be located on the same navigation device, I do not think this is a \nserious concern. (D.I. 96 at 1-2). I am confident that the jury will read the claim language in its \nentirety and understand that the primary and remote buttons must be located on the same \nnavigation device. (I could so instruct the jury if this remains a concern at trial.). \nThus, I will reject Plaintiff's proposed construction because it is ambiguous and does not \nalign with the meaning of \"remote.\" I will construe \"remote\" to mean \"distant in space.\" \n7 IV. CONCLUSION \nWithin five days the parties shall submit a proposed order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion suitable for submission to the jury. \n8 "}
