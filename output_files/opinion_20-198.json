Pro se Petitioner.\nCarolyn Shelly Hake, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Attorney for Respondents.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nApril 6, 2023\nWilmington, DelawareCONNOLLY. CHIEF\nPending before the Court is Petitioner Ramon Ruffin\u2019s Petition for a Writ of\nHabeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. (D.l. 3) The State filed an Answer in\nopposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.l. 13; D.l. 18) For the reasons\ndiscussed, the Court will deny the Petition as barred by the limitations period prescribed\nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244.\nI. BACKGROUND\nIn February 2014, Petitioner was charged in an eleven-count indictment with the\nfollowing offenses: one count of attempted first degree robbery, three counts of\npossession of a firearm during commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d), one count of first\ndegree assault, one count of aggravated menacing, two counts of possession of a\nfirearm by a person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u201d), one count of receiving a stolen firearm, one\ncount of disregarding a police officer's signal, and one count of resisting arrest. (D.l. 12-\n6 at 8-12) The PFBPP counts were severed and then subsequently nolle pressed by\nthe State. (D.l. 12-2 at Entry Nos. 2, 3, 5) On October 29, 2014, a Delaware Superior\nCourt jury convicted Petitioner of second degree assault (as the lesser-included-offense\nof first degree assault) and the other non-severed charges. (D.l. 12-6 at 149-159)\nOn January 15, 2015, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as a habitual\noffender to a minimum of 113 years in prison. (D.l. 12-1 at Entry Nos. 27, 28; D.l. 12-5\nat 5-11) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence on\nDecember 3, 2015. See Ruffin v. State, 131 A.3d 295, 308 (Del. 2015).\nOn July 15. 2016, Petitioner filed a pro se motion for postconviction relief\npursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 along with a motion to appoint\n2counsel. (D.l. 12-1 at Entry Nos. 43, 45, 46, 47; D.l. 12-12) The Superior Court granted\nthe motion to appoint counsel. (D.l. 12-1 at Entry No. 49) After reviewing Petitioner\u2019s\npro se Rule 61 motion, postconviction counsel filed a letter with the Superior Court\nstating that he would not be amending the Rule 61 motion because he was satisfied that\nthe original Rule 61 motion addressed all issues. (D.l. 12-1 at Entry No. 61) On May 9,\n2018, a Superior Court Commissioner recommended denying the Rule 61 motion. See\nState V. Ruffin, 2018 WL 2202278 (Del. Super. Ct. May 9, 2018). The Superior Court\nadopted the Commissioner\u2019s Report and Recommendation on June 14, 2018. (D.l. 12-\n19 at 41-44) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decisions on\nFebruary 19, 2019. See Ruffin v. State, 205 A.3d 822 (Table), 2019 WL 719038 (Del.\nFeb. 19, 2019).\nIn February 2020, Petitioner filed the instant Petition asserting the following three\ngrounds for relief: (1) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to move\nfor a suppression hearing when two of the State\u2019s witnesses identified him in court after\nreviewing two photographs just prior to testifying and/or by failing to request an\nidentification jury instruction about cautioning the two witnesses\u2019 identification (D.l. 3 at\n5-7; D.l. 5 at 21-27); (2) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to\nobject to the trial court\u2019s erroneous decision to allow in an in-court identification and\nwaiting almost a week to file a motion for a mistrial (D.l. 3 at 7-8; D.l. 5 at 27-29); and\n(3) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by requesting that the gun found in\nthe minivan be submitted for DNA testing (D.l. 3 at 8-9; D.l. 5 at 30-32).\n3ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\"AEDPA\u201d) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences\n. . . . and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism. Woodford v.\nGarceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). AEDPA prescribes a one-year period of limitations\nfor the filing of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which begins to run from the latest\nof:\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\nseeking such review;\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application\ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws\nof the United States is removed, if the applicant was\nprevented from filing by such State action;\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was\ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been\nnewly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\nclaims presented could have been discovered through the\nexercise of due diligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable\ntolling. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may also be excused from failing to comply\nwith the limitations period by making a gateway showing of actual innocence. See\nWallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4\u2018^ 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual innocence exception).\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court does not discern, any facts triggering\nthe application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D). Consequently, the one-year period of\n4limitations began to run when Petitioner\u2019s convictions became final under\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment\nbut does not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the\nstatute of limitations begins to run upon expiration of the 90-day time period allowed for\nseeking certiorari review. See Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565, 575, 578 (3d Cir.\n1999); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir. 1999). In this case, the Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction on December 3, 2015, and he did not\nseek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his judgment of\nconviction became final on March 2, 2016. Applying the one-year limitations period to\nthat date. Petitioner had until March 2, 2017 to timely file a habeas petition. See Wilson\nV. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 (3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s\nlimitations period): Phlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27\n2015) (AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is calculated according to the anniversary\nmethod, i.e., the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the date it began to\nrun). Petitioner filed the instant Petition on February 10, 2020,^ almost three full years\nafter that deadline. Thus, the Petition is time-barred and should be dismissed, unless\nthe limitations period can be statutorily or equitably tolled, or Petitioner makes a\n^Petitioner electronically filed the Petition. Pursuant to the prisoner mailbox rule, the\nCourt adopts as the filing date the date on which Petitioner provided the petition to\nprison authorities to be electronically filed: February 10, 2020. See Longenette v.\nKrusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761 (3d Cir. 2003) (the date on which a prisoner transmitted\ndocuments to prison authorities for mailing is to be considered the actual filing date).\n5gateway showing of actual innocence. See Jones, 195 F.3d at 158; see Wallace, 2\nF.4*^ at 151 (explaining that actual innocence is an \u201cexception to the statute of\nlimitations\" rather than an \u201cextension to the statute of limitations via equitable tolling.\u201d).\nThe Court will discuss each doctrine in turn.\nA. Statutory Tolling\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction  motion tolls\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts,\nincluding any post-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending\nbefore the expiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d\n417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A post-conviction motion is \u2018\u201cproperly filed\u2019 for statutory\ntolling purposes when its delivery and acceptance is in compliance with the state\u2019s\napplicable laws and rules governing filings, such as the form of the document, any time\nlimits upon its delivery, the location of the filing, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d Crump v.\nPhelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations period is also tolled for\nthe time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed even if\nthe appeal is not eventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. The limitations period\nhowever, is not tolled during the 90 days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state\npost-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist Att\u2019y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d\nCir. 2001).\nWhen Petitioner filed his Rule 61 motion on July 15, 2016, 134 days of the\nlimitations period had already lapsed. The Rule 61 motion tolled the limitations period\nfrom July 15, 2016 through February 19, 2019, the date on which the Delaware\n6Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s denial of the Rule 61 motion. The\nlimitations clock started to run again on February 20, 2019, and ran the remaining 231\ndays without interruption until the limitations period expired on October 9, 2019.\nTherefore, statutory tolling does not render the Petition timely filed.\nB. Equitable Tolling\nThe one-year limitations period may be toiled for equitable reasons in rare\ncircumstances when the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and\nprevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence\ninquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to the petitioner\u2019s\nexcusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. Additionally, the obligation to act diligently \u201cdoes not\npertain solely to the filing of the federal habeas petition, rather it is an obligation that\nexists during the period [the petitioner] is exhausting state court remedies as well.\nLaCava v. Kyler, 398 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 2005). As for the extraordinary\ncircumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged\nto be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with\nrespect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385\n401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if\nthere is \u201ca causa! connection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and\nthe petitioner\u2019s failure to file a timely federal petition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784\n803 (3d. Cir. 2013).\nPetitioner contends that equitable tolling is warranted because: (1) he believed\nthe one-year limitations period would start to run from the date on which his post-\n7conviction appeal was decided (D.l. 18 at 2, 5); (2) the inmate who had been helping\nhim prepare his Petition was moved to a lesser security area (D.l. 18 at 3); (3) the\ninstructions for the form \u00a7 2254 petition do not explain how the tolling doctrine affects\nthe one-year limitations period (D.l. 18 at 4, 6); (4) he was quarantined without access\nto any of his personal belongings between October 6, 2019 and November 13. 2019\nand, while not confirmed, he believes the illness was Covid-19 (D.l. 18 at 11); and (5)\nthe limited legal materials in the law library does not mention the limitations period (D.l.\n18 at 10). The Court is not persuaded. Petitioner\u2019s complaints about the limited legal\nmaterials and lack of access to his jailhouse lawyer involve routine aspects of prison life\nwhich may create difficulties in filing habeas petitions but do not constitute extraordinary\ncircumstances sufficient to equitably toll the limitation period. See Dailey v. Phelps\n2008 WL 2945956, at *4 (D. Del. July 29, 2008). To the extent Petitioner\u2019s late filing in\nthis Court was due to a lack of legal knowledge or miscalculation of AEDPA\u2019s one-year\nfiling period, such circumstances do not warrant equitably tolling the limitations period.\nSee Taylor v. Carroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May 14, 2004). As for\nPetitioner\u2019s contention that his placement in quarantine prevented him from complying\nwith the one-year deadline, the Court notes that Petitioner\u2019s quarantine started on\nOctober 6, 2019, just three days before the limitations period expired on October 9\n2019. The Petition would still be untimely even if the Court were to equitably toll the\nlimitations period for those three days.\nGiven these circumstances, the Court concludes that equitable tolling is not\navailable to Petitioner on the facts he has presented.\n8C. Actual Innocence\nFinally, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable\nexception\u201d that can overcome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. See\nMcQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4^^^ at 150-151.\nPetitioner, however, does not assert any claim of actual innocence.\nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that the Petition is time-barred.\nD. Motion to Expand Record\nPetitioner filed a Motion to Expand the Record during the pendency of this\nproceeding. (D.l. 20) Petitioner asks that the Court order the State to submit \u201cExhibit D\n(No. 5)\u201d that was part of the evidence for his case, as well as the two photos that were\nshown to the State\u2019s witnesses during the out-of-court identification. {Id. at 1) Having\ndecided to dismiss the Petition for being time-barred, the Court will dismiss the Motion\nas moot.\nCERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\nA district court issuing a final order denying a  \u00a72254 petition must also decide\nwhether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2253(c)(2). When a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds\nwithout reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a\ncertificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would\nfind it debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a\nconstitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling. See\nSlack V. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition is time-barred. Reasonable\n9jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the Court will not\nissue a certificate of appealability.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will dismiss the instant Petition as\ntime-barred without holding an evidentiary hearing or issuing a certificate of\nappealability. The Court will enter an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n10IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nRAMON RUFFIN\nPetitioner,\nCivil Action No. 20-198-CFC V.\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\nRespondents.\nORDER\nAt Wilmington on this Sixth day of April in 2023, for the reasons set forth in\nthe Memorandum Opinion issued this date;\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1.
