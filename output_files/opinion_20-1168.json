(D.I. 2) Fayson\nseeks judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s August 21, 2019 final decision denying Fayson\u2019s\nclaim for supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (the\n\u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383f. Currently before the court are cross-motions for summary\njudgment filed by Fayson and the Commissioner.? (D.I. 17; D.I. 20) For the reasons set forth\nbelow, Fayson\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 17) is DENIED and the Commissioner\u2019s\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 20) is GRANTED.\n\n' Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge to conduct all proceedings in this\nmatter through final judgment, and the case was assigned to the undersigned judicial officer on\nMarch 26, 2021. (D.I. 16)\n\n3 The briefing for the present motions is as follows: Fayson\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 18), the\nCommissioner\u2019s combined opening brief in support of the motion for summary judgment and\nanswering brief in opposition to Fayson\u2019s motion (D.I. 21). On July 12, 2021, Fayson filed a\nnotice indicating her intention to rest on her opening brief. (D.I. 22)\nL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nFayson protectively filed an application for SSI in December 2016, alleging a disability\nonset date of December 1, 2016, due to bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, hepatitis C, and\nhigh blood pressure. (D.I. 13-6 at 2-6) Fayson\u2019s claims were denied initially in March 2017 and\nupon reconsideration in March 2018. (D.I. 13-4 at 2-6, 19-24) At Fayson\u2019s request, an\nadministrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on July 29, 2019. (D.L. 13-2 at 37-83; D.I. 13-4\nat 25-30) The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on August 21, 2019, finding that Fayson was\ncapable of a full range of work at all exertional levels, but with several nonexertional limitations:\n\u201c(t]he claimant can perform simple, routine, and repetitive tasks, not at a production pace,\ninvolving simple, work-related decisions and few changes in a routine work setting. The\nclaimant can have frequent interaction with supervisors and coworkers, perform occasional\ntandem work, and have occasional interaction with the public. The claimant can work in a low\nstress environment, which is defined as an environment in which she is not required to work with\nalcohol, prescription, or illicit drugs.\u201d (D.I. 13-2 at 11-25) The Appeals Council subsequently\ndenied Fayson\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final\ndecision of the Commissioner. (Jd. at 2-4)\n\nFayson brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on September 1, 2020.\n(D.L. 2) Fayson filed her motion for summary judgment on April 8, 2021 (D.I. 17), and the\nCommissioner filed a cross-motion on July 8, 2021 (D.I. 20). Briefing is now complete on the\n\npending motions.\nB. Medical History\n1. Medical Evidence\n\nFayson was 44 years old on her alleged disability onset date. (D.I. 13-2 at 24) Fayson\nhas an eighth-grade education and earned her GED in 1996. (Jd. at 42,57) The ALJ found that\nFayson has no past relevant work under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.965. (id. at 24) The ALJ found that\nFayson has the following severe impairments: bipolar disorder, panic disorder, depression,\nalcohol use disorder, and polysubstance abuse.\u2019 (Jd. at 16) The focus of Fayson\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment is whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision giving no weight\nto the opinions of Fayson\u2019s treating providers that she has severe or moderately severe\nlimitations from her mental impairments. (D.I. 18 at 11-19)\n\nThe record reflects that Fayson has a long history of significant mental health issues,\nincluding prior suicide attempts, with a prior finding of disability and eligibility for SSI in 2005.\n(DI. 13-2 at 20, 45-47) Fayson testified that her SSI benefits were discontinued because she\naccidentally signed a form that ended her benefits, while the ALJ asserts that Fayson\u2019s benefits\nwere discontinued due to treatment noncompliance and improved condition. (/d.)\n\nSince October of 2014, Fayson treated with Patricia Lifrak, M.D., her psychiatrist,\nintermittently for management of depression and anxiety. (D.I. 13-7 at 239-249) In November\nof 2016, shortly before the date of her application, Fayson presented to Dr. Lifrak and generally\n\nreported feeling depressed and anxious with difficulty sleeping. (/d. at 248-249) Dr. Lifrak\n\n4 The ALJ noted that Fayson applied for SSI due to a hepatitis C and high blood pressure, in\naddition to bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety, however Fayson did not offer testimony\nconcerning these impairments at the hearing and maintained that her mental impairments affect\nher functional capabilities more so than anything else. (D.I. 13-2 at 16-17)\n\n3\ndiagnosed Fayson with severe major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms and anxiety\ndisorder, prescribed Fayson several medications, and recommended outpatient therapy. (Jd.)\n\nFollowing her December 2016 SSI filing date, Fayson did not present for further mental\nhealth treatment until May 9, 2017, when she attended an eight-day partial hospitalization\nprogram at Rockford Center for mental health issues and substance abuse following a relapse.\n(D.I. 13-8 at 470-473) Her diagnoses upon admission were bipolar disorder and alcohol and\ncocaine use disorder described as moderate. (Jd. at 471-472) At that time, Fayson reported that\nshe was not taking any medications. (/d. at 472) Fayson was administratively discharged from\nRockford Center due to nonattendance. (/d.) Fayson had the same diagnoses on discharge and\nwas found to have a guarded prognosis. (/d. at 470-473) The healthcare providers at Rockford\nCenter prescribed Fayson medication and advised her to continue with outpatient mental health\ntreatment. (/d.)\n\nAfter an absence from treatment since November of 2016, Fayson resumed routine\npsychiatric visits with Dr. Lifrak for the first six months of 2018, during which Fayson generally\nreported feeling irritable and anxious with low motivation and energy at times. (/d. at 206-210)\nOn mental status examinations, Dr. Lifrak noted that Fayson was irritable and anxious and\nexhibited a tearful affect at times, but had good judgment, insight, and impulse control, with no\nsuicidal or homicidal ideas, intent, or plans, and no evidence of agitation, manic, or out of\ncontrol behavior. (/d.) Dr. Lifrak continually altered Fayson\u2019s medication regimen and dosage\nthroughout that period. (Jd.)\n\nIn May of 2018, Fayson began outpatient treatment at Mid-Atlantic Behavioral Health,\nwhich involved therapy and medication management. (D.I. 13-8 at 167-179, 369-463) On May\n\n22, 2018, Fayson was evaluated by Daniel Weintraub, Ph.D. at Mid-Atlantic Behavioral Health.\n(Id. at 369-372) Fayson appeared well groomed, alert, and attentive, exhibited a depressed\nmood, blunted affect, fair judgment concerning everyday activities and social situations, and\nnormal speech and thought processes. (/d.) Dr. Weintraub diagnosed Fayson with bipolar\ndisorder and panic disorder without agoraphobia. (/d.)\n\nOn October 20, 2018, Julie Keaveney, Psy.D., Fayson\u2019s treating psychologist, completed\na series of psychological tests which included a Personality Assessment Inventory, Rorschach\nInkblot Test, Thematic Apperception Test, and Trauma Symptom Inventory.\u2019 (/d. at 167-174)\nDr. Keaveney found, based on the testing and clinical interview, that Fayson had a substantially\nelevated depressive index, an elevated anxiety index, and a panic disorder. (Jd. at 175-176)\nFayson\u2019s symptoms included nightmares caused by trauma, flashbacks, hypervigilance,\ndetachment, and sleep disturbance. (/d.) Dr. Keaveney recommended treatment including\npsychotherapy, trauma focused therapy, exercise, medication management, behavioral activation,\nand bipolar disorder education. (/d.)\n\nFrom June of 2018, Fayson remained under the care of multiple providers at Mid-Atlantic\nBehavioral Health for therapy and medication management. (/d. at 373-463) She treated with\nKristen David, a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner (\u201cNP\u201d), Therapists Jennie Lowe,\nMSW and Lisa Darby, LCSW, and Dr. Keaveney. (/d.) Through early December of 2018,\nFayson was routinely observed to be alert, oriented, well groomed, and healthy, with normal to\n\nfair judgment and insight, normal memory, normal capacity for sustained mental activity and\n\n5 A Personality Assessment Inventory is used to assess psychological functioning and \u201cprovides\na number of validity indices that are designed to provide an assessment of factors that could\ndistort the results of testing.\u201d (D.I. 13-8 at 170) The Rorschach Inkblot Test is a projective test\nused to assess psychological functioning. (/d. at 171) A Thematic Apperception Test is used as\na projective measure of personality. (/d. at 173) Finally, a Trauma Symptom Inventory is used\nto assess for the presence and severity of symptoms related to trauma. (Id.)\n\n5\nabstract thinking, and normal thought processes, but at times had a depressed mood and blunted\naffect. (/d. at 369-404) Fayson was assessed as having a low or no risk of harm to self or others.\n(Id.) Beginning mid-December of 2018, Fayson regularly exhibited a negativistic, tense,\ngloomy, sad and/or unhappy mood, flat affect, poor judgment concerning everyday activities and\nsocial situations, quiet speech, and an uncooperative or guarded attitude when presenting to\nTherapists Lowe and Darby. (Id. at 405-411, 416-427, 432-451, 455-463) Lowe and Darby\nnoted that Fayson had a moderate risk of harm to self or others beginning in February of 2019\nafter Fayson reported having suicidal thoughts. (/d. at 424-427, 432-451, 455-456, 458-463)\nDuring that period, Fayson also presented to NP David, who consistently noted that Fayson had\nlow or no risk of harm to self or others, appeared well groomed and healthy, alert and oriented,\nand exhibited normal mood and affect, intact memory, normal speech, normal judgment\nconcerning everyday activities and social situations, and was cooperative. (Id. at 401-404, 412-\n415, 428-431, 452-454, 457)\n2. Medical Opinions\na. State Agency Psychological Consultants\n\nFayson attended a consultative psychological examination with licensed psychologist\nBrian Simon, Psy.D.\u00b0 on March 13, 2017. (D.I. 13-7 at 322-328) The state agency examination\noccurred approximately three months after Fayson applied for benefits and, at the time, she was\nnot participating in regularly scheduled mental health treatment. (/d.; D.I. 13-8 at 470-73; D.I.\n\n18 at 7-8; D.I. 21 at 9) Dr. Simon observed that Fayson was well groomed and made intermittent\n\n6 As noted in the Commissioner\u2019s brief, the ALJ incorrectly states that Ramnik Singh, M.D.\nconducted the March 2017 psychological consultative examination, when it was conducted by\nBrian Simon, Psy.D. (D.I. 21 at 8 n.2; D.I. 13-2 at 20-21; D.I. 13-7 at 322-330) The exhibit\ndescription for Exhibit No. 12F also incorrectly recites \u201cCE Psychology, dated 03/13/2017, from\nSINGH, RAMNIK MD.\u201d (D.I. 13-7 at 1)\neye contact, had fair attention and concentration, good immediate and short-term memory,\ncoherent and goal directed speech, adequate abstraction ability, fair insight and judgment, and no\nsuicidal or homicidal ideations, but her affect was constricted, her mood was slightly dysthymic,\nand she appeared a bit anxious. (D.I. 13-7 at 326-327) He observed that Fayson \u201cis capable of\ninteracting appropriately with others\u201d and \u201chas not encountered any significant difficulties being\nable to get along with others at home, school, or at work in the past, but she is not comfortable in\ncrowded situations.\u201d (Jd. at 327) Further, Dr. Simon opined that Fayson appeared capable of\nunderstanding, following, and carrying out instructions, making decisions, exercising judgment,\ninsight, and common sense at work, performing simple tasks, and avoiding hazards at work.\n\nUd.) He noted that Fayson may encounter problems adapting to different circumstances and\nbeing able to persist for a normal work period due to her psychiatric problems. (/d.)\n\nDr. Simon diagnosed Fayson with bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed,\npanic disorder, and agoraphobia. (/d.) He estimated that Fayson had moderately severe\nimpairments in her ability to sustain work performance and attendance in a normal work setting\nand cope with pressures of ordinary work, moderate impairments in carrying out instructions,\nperforming routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary supervision, relating to other people, and\nperforming daily activities, and mild impairments in understanding simple, primarily oral\ninstructions. (Id. at 322-323)\n\nA records review was performed by state agency psychological consultant, Christopher\nKing, Psy.D. on March 15, 2017. (D.I. 13-3 at 2-14) Dr. King opined that Fayson had no\nunderstanding or memory limitations, had fair attention and concentration skills sufficient for\nsimple, repetitive tasks, and was capable of a basic work routine within a solidary environment.\n\n(Id.) Dr. King found that Fayson had severe impairments of depressive, bipolar and related\ndisorders and anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. (/d. at 9) Dr. King estimated that\nFayson had moderate limitations in her ability to carry out detailed instructions and respond\n\n_ appropriately to criticism from supervisors, interact appropriately with the general public, and\nmaintain attention and concentration for extended periods. (/d. at 11-12)\n\nAt the state agency\u2019s request, Fayson attended a consultative psychological examination\nwith Ramnik Singh, M.D. on March 1, 2018. (D.I. 13-8 at 149-156) Dr. Singh observed that\nFayson was well groomed and maintained intermittent eye contact, appeared alert and oriented,\nbut that her affect was constricted. (/d. at 150-151) Upon examination, Fayson exhibited no\nabnormalities in her thought process and no current suicidal or homicidal ideation. (/d.) She had\nreduced remote memory, but her immediate memory was intact. (/d.) Dr. Singh diagnosed\nFayson with bipolar II disorder and a history of alcohol and cocaine use and gave her a global\nassessment of functioning (\u201c\u201cGAF\u201d) score of 65 to 68.\u2019 (Jd.) Dr. Singh estimated that Fayson\nhad moderate to moderately severe limitations in her ability to perform complex tasks and work\nin an environment requiring frequent contact with others. (/d. at 152) Dr. Singh estimated that\nFayson had moderate limitations in the following abilities: relating to other people, performing\ndaily activities, constriction of interest, comprehending and following instructions, performing\nwork where contact with others will be minimal, and performing simple, repetitive, or varied\ntasks. (Id. at 152-153)\n\nOn March 13, 2018, a records review was performed by state agency psychological\n\n7\u201cGAF scores are used by \u2018mental health clinicians and doctors to rate the social, occupational,\nand psychological functioning of adults.\u201d\u201d Rios v.

App\u2019x 189, 190 n. 1 (3d Cir. 2007)).\n\u201cThe GAF scale ranges from 1 to 100, with a score of 1 being the lowest and 100 being the\nhighest.\u201d Id. \u201cA GAF score of 51-60 indicates moderate symptoms or moderate difficulty in\nsocial, occupational, or school functioning.\u201d Jd.\n\n8\nconsultant, Patricia Miripol, Ph.D. (D.I. 13-3 at 23-30) She opined that Fayson is able to\nunderstand, remember, and carry out simple instructions and tasks and \u201cappears capable of\nsimple/routine work with limited social interaction/public contact demands.\u201d (Jd. at 28)\nb. Plaintiff\u2019s Treating Providers\n\nOn December 7, 2018, Dr. Keaveney completed a Psychological Functional Capacity\nEvaluation. (D.I. 13-8 at 339-341) Dr. Keaveney opined that Fayson\u2019s mental illness is severe\nand debilitating and interferes with her sleep, concentration, and energy. (/d. at 339) Dr.\nKeaveney opined that Fayson is not able to reliably attend work 40 hours per week and does not\nhave the ability to remain on task at least 80% of the workday due to her depression and PTSD\ninterfering with her concentration and memory. (/d.) According to Dr. Keaveney, Fayson had\nsevere impairments in her ability to cope with pressures of ordinary work and moderately severe\nlimitations in her ability to perform activities of daily living, relate to other people, carry out\ninstructions under ordinary supervision, sustain work performance and attendance in a normal\nwork setting, and perform routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary supervision. (Jd. at 340-341)\n\nTherapists Lowe and Darby completed a joint Psychological Functional Capacity\nEvaluation on April 5, 2019, opining that Fayson does not have the ability to work full-time due\nto her depression related to her bipolar disorder causing paranoia, in which she believes others\nwill hurt her or are plotting against her. (Jd. at 290-292) Lowe and Darby also opined that\nFayson\u2019s hypervigilance and racing thoughts inhibit her ability to focus on even short, simple\nprocesses to complete a task. (/d. at 290) According to Lowe and Darby, Fayson had severe\nlimitations in her ability to relate to other people, perform daily activities, carry out instructions\nunder ordinary supervision, sustain work performance and attendance in a normal work setting,\n\ncope with pressures of ordinary work, and perform routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary\nsupervision, and moderately severe limitations in understanding simple, primarily oral\ninstructions. (/d. at 291-292)\n\nOn May 10, 2019, NP David completed a Psychological Functional Capacity Evaluation,\nopining that Fayson does not have the ability to perform simple, repetitive work 40 hours per\nweek without missing more than two days per month and that Fayson\u2019s anxiety and mood\nsymptoms prevent her from being able to concentrate and complete work-related tasks. (/d. at\n293) NP David opined that Fayson had moderately severe limitations in her ability to understand\nsimple, primarily oral instructions, carry out instructions under ordinary supervision, sustain\nwork performance and attendance in a normal work setting, cope with pressures of ordinary\nwork, and perform routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary supervision. (Id. at 294-295)\n\nFayson\u2019s primary care physician, Molly Sandrian, D.O., completed a Psychological\nFunctional Capacity Evaluation on July 7, 2019, opining that Fayson does not have the ability to\nwork full-time because she is unable to get out of bed most days, barely prepares her own meals,\nand bathing and self-hygiene, such as brushing teeth, occurs only twice per week. (Id. at 474-\n480; D.I. 18 at 6) Dr. Sandrian opined that Fayson does not have the ability to remain on task at\nleast 80% of the work day due to poor short-term memory, including forgetting what she is\nsaying mid-sentence and difficulty maintaining focus. (D.I. 13-8 at 474) According to Dr.\nSandrian, Fayson had severe limitations in her ability to sustain work performance and\nattendance in a normal work setting, cope with pressures of ordinary work, and perform daily\nactivities, moderately severe limitations in carrying out instructions under ordinary supervision\nand performing routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary supervision, and mild limitations in her\nability to relate to other people and understand simple, primarily oral, instructions.

Fayson\u2019s Testimony\n\nAt the administrative hearing on July 29, 2019, Fayson testified that she has an eighth-\ngrade education and received her GED in 1996. (D.I. 13-2 at 42, 57) She testified that her most\nrecent employment was in 2017, when she worked for temporary agencies doing various jobs,\nincluding a job as a flagger and a job working in a warehouse. (Jd. at 42-43) Fayson explained\nthat she experiences anxiety and panic attacks while in large crowds, taking public\ntransportation, and working, in which she hears voices and thinks people are talking about her or\nare out to get her. (/d. at 52-53, 55-56) She testified that she has difficulty concentrating and\nhears voices once a week to once a month depending on when she takes her medication. (Jd. at\n56)\n\nFayson testified that she lives with her teenage children in a two-story townhouse.

(Id. at 45, 54, 56-57) She testified that she spends most of her time in her second-floor\nbedroom in the dark, either laying down or watching television. (/d. at 44,53) According to\nFayson, she is not able to attend her children\u2019s school events, requires assistance grocery\nshopping, and eats by herself in her bedroom because she does not want to be downstairs. (Jd. at\n53-54) Fayson explained that she has never had a driver\u2019s license and is afraid to drive because\n\nshe fears she may hurt herself or others or may have paranoia or a panic attack while driving.\n\n\u00ae Fayson\u2019s friend also testified at the administrative hearing, and his observations were consistent\nwith Fayson\u2019s testimony. (D.I. 13-2 at 60-68) He testified that Fayson\u2019s mood fluctuates, she\nspends most of her time in her bedroom, and she requires assistance grocery shopping, keeping\nappointments, and maintaining her home due to her anxiety and panic attacks. (/d. at 61-63, 65-\n66) He indicated that Fayson is significantly limited by her impairments, but he felt she could\nperform some small, menial tasks. (/d. at 67) Thus, the ALJ gave \u201csome weight\u201d to his\ntestimony. (/d. at 20)\n\n11\n(Cd. at 45) Her friend drives her to her doctor\u2019s appointments and to church occasionally. (Jd. at\n48, 51) She explained that she often leaves church when it is very crowded because she\nexperiences panic attacks. (/d. at 48-49) In response to the ALJ\u2019s questioning, Fayson stated\nthat she has been sober since March 2017. (Id. at 47-48, 58)\n\nFayson testified that she complained to Dr. Lifrak that she heard voices and was\nprescribed medication. (Jd. at 49-50) The medication helped her symptoms, but made her\ndrowsy. (/d.) She testified that she has been seeing Therapist Lowe every two weeks for\napproximately the past year and was prescribed medication from NP David. (/d. at 50-51) She\nindicated that she found her sessions with Lowe helpful. (Jd. at 52)\n\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing on July 29, 2019, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical\nto the vocational expert (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\nFor any hypothetical you hear today, please assume an individual of the\n\nClaimant\u2019s age, education, and experience. If such individual is able to\n\nperform only simple, routine, repetitive tasks, and not at a production pace;\n\nif the individual is able to make only simple work-related decisions, tolerate\n\nfew changes in a routine work setting; if the individual is able to interact\n\nwith supervisors and coworkers only frequently, and only occasionally\n\nwork in tandem with others, and only occasionally interact with the public;\n\nif the individual must work in a low stress environment, and I\u2019m defining\n\nthat as an environment in which the individual is not required to work with\n\nalcohol or prescription drugs or illicit drugs, are there any jobs in the\n\nnational economy that such an individual could perform?\n(D.I. 13-2 at 70) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a hypothetical\nindividual could work in unskilled occupations as a table worker of leather products, an inserter\nof paper goods, or a garment bagger. (Id. at 25, 70-71) In response to the ALJ\u2019s question, the\nVE confirmed that work would still be available in these unskilled positions if the hypothetical\n\nindividual was only occasionally able to interact with supervisors, coworkers, and the public.\n\n12\n(Id. at 75)\n\nIn response to questioning by Fayson\u2019s counsel, the VE testified that the absentee\ntolerance for these jobs is one day per month. (/d. at 71) The VE also testified that a\nhypothetical individual who would be off-task part of the day would not be able to participate in\ncompetitive employment. (/d.) Likewise, the VE testified that competitive employment would\nbe precluded if production was reduced by 20% or more because of the hypothetical individual\u2019s\nlimitations. (Id. at 74-75)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the medical evidence in the record and the testimony by Fayson, her friend, and\nthe VE, the ALJ determined that Fayson was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time\nperiod from the December 1, 2016 disability onset date through the July 29, 2019 hearing date.\n(D.L. 13-2 at 14-25) The ALJ found, in pertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since December 1,\n2016, the application date (20 CFR 416.971 et seq.).\n\n2. The claimant has the following severe impairments: bipolar disorder, panic\ndisorder, depression, alcohol use disorder, and polysubstance abuse (20 CFR\n416.920(c)).\n\n3. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 416.920(d), 416.925 and\n416.926).\n\n4. ...[T]he claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform a full range\nof work at all exertional levels but with the following nonexertional\nlimitations: The claimant can perform simple, routine, and repetitive tasks, not\nat a production pace, involving simple, work-related decisions and few\nchanges in a routine work setting. The claimant can have frequent interaction\nwith supervisors and coworkers, perform occasional tandem work, and have\noccasional interaction with the public. The claimant can work in a low stress\nenvironment, which is defined as an environment in which she is not required\nto work with alcohol, prescription, or illicit drugs.\n\n13\n5. The claimant has no past relevant work (20 CFR 416.965).\n\n6. The claimant was...defined as a younger individual age 18-49, on the date the\napplication was filed (20 CFR 416.963).\n\n7. The claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate\nin English (20 CFR 416.964).\n\n8. Transferability of job skills is not an issue because the claimant does not have\npast relevant work (20 CFR 416.968).\n\n9. Considering the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual\nfunctional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\nnational economy that the claimant can perform (20 CFR 416.969 and\n416.969(a)).\n10. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, since December 1, 2016, the date the application was filed (20 CFR\n416.920(g)).\n(Id. at 16-25)\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\nevidence supports the decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S.\nCt. 1148, 1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a reasonable\n\n209\n\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 839\nF. App\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\n\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\n\n14\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle XVI of the Social Security Act provides for the payment of disability benefits to\nindigent persons under the SSI program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a). A disability is the \u201cinability to\nengage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or\nmental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be\nexpected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).\nA claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they preclude a return to\nprevious work or engagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work existing in the\nnational economy. Jd. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22 (2003).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir. 1999). If\nthe Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the sequential\nprocess, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4). At step\none, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in any substantial gainful\nactivity. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful\nactivity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is suffering from\na severe impairment or a severe combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. When a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is presumed disabled. See\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii). If a claimant\u2019s impairment, either singly or in combination, fails\n\n15\nto meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\n416.920(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186\nF.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do despite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak\nv. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). The\nclaimant bears the burden of demonstrating the inability to return to past relevant work. See\nPlummer, 186 F.3d at 428\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other words, the\nCommissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age,\neducation, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the Plaintiff Has Greater Mental Health Restrictions Than Those\nIncluded in the RFC Finding\n\nFayson argues that the ALJ improperly evaluated the medical opinion evidence and, thus,\nthe VE\u2019s testimony was based on a defective RFC insufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s denial of\nbenefits. (D.I. 18 at 12-14) Fayson contends that the only remedy to correct an inaccurate RFC\nis remand. (Id. at 14) Specifically, Fayson argues that (1) the opinions of Dr. Keaveney, Dr.\n\nSandrian, NP David, and Therapists Lowe and Darby each establish greater limitations than\n\n16\nthose in the RFC; (2) the ALJ did not provide legally sufficient reasons to give \u201cno weight\u201d to\nthese opinions and failed to consider their internal consistency and their treating source or\nspecialist status pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c); (3) the ALJ improperly discounted Dr.\nSimon\u2019s opinion because Fayson was not undergoing formal mental health treatment at the time;\nand (4) the ALJ improperly relied on the opinions of state agency psychological consultants. (Id.\nat 11-19)\n\nThe ALJ rejected all five opinions for the same general reason, that they were\ninconsistent with \u201c[t]he totality of the claimant\u2019s mental health treatment records,\u201d including the\noverall stable and benign findings on mental status examinations during the period surrounding\nthe opinions and Fayson\u2019s self-reported daily activities and abilities.? (D.I. 13-2 at 19-23) The\nALJ cited throughout the decision to three exhibits, 21F, 23F and 33F,!\u00b0 and found that the\nexhibits supported stable and benign mental status examinations. (Jd. at 22-23) According to the\n\nCommissioner, the ALJ had no duty to recite each treating source factor in the written decision,\n\n9 The ALJ noted that Fayson reported no problems with personal care, taking medications,\npreparing simple meals, handling finances, sleeping, attending church with her family, getting\nalong with authority figures, and handling changes in routine. (D.I. 13-2 at 23; D.I. 13-6 at 28-\n34; D.I. 13-7 at 327)\n\n10 Exhibit 21F details Dr. Keaveney\u2019s November 2018 Psychological Evaluation Report, finding\nthat Fayson appeared well groomed, alert, oriented, with adequate concentration, logical thought\nprocess, fair insight and judgment, and no suicidal thoughts, but had a depressed mood and\nblunted affect. (D.I. 13-8 at 167-177) Exhibit 23F details 2018 treatment records from Dr.\nLifrak, in which she found that Fayson\u2019s mood fluctuated from irritable and anxious to\ndepressed, her affect fluctuated from tearful to full range, and that Fayson denied suicidal or\nhomicidal thoughts, had good judgment, insight, and impulse control, with no evidence of\nagitation, manic, or out of control behavior. (/d. at 206-210) Exhibit 33F details Fayson\u2019s May\n2018 to May 2019 treatment records from her treating providers at Mid-Atlantic Behavioral\nHealth and, as discussed, infra, Fayson regularly exhibited a negativistic, tense, gloomy, sad\nand/or unhappy mood, flat affect, poor judgment concerning everyday activities and social\nsituations, quiet speech, and an uncooperative or guarded attitude when presenting to Therapists\nLowe and Darby, but overall stable and benign findings when presenting to NP David. (Jd. at\n375-463)\n\n17\nhad no duty to consider that the discounted opinions were consistent with each other as they were\nneither well-supported nor consistent with the record as a whole, and the ALJ properly evaluated\nall opinions in the context of the entire medical record. (D.I. 21 at 11-16)\n\nBecause of its filing date, Fayson\u2019s claim falls within the \u201ctreating source doctrine,\u201d\nwhich requires a treating source\u2019s opinion to be given controlling or substantial weight if it is\n\u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not\ninconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the claimant\u2019s] case record.\u201d!! Fargnoli v.\nMassanari, 247 F.3d 34, 43 (3d Cir. 2001); Mason v. Shalala, 994 F.2d 1058, 1067 (3d Cir.\n1993); see also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2). Although the findings and opinions of treating\nphysicians are entitled to substantial weight, \u201c\u2018[t]he law is clear . . . that the opinion of a treating\nphysician does not bind the ALJ on the issue of functional capacity.\u201d\u201d Chandler v. Comm\u2019r of\nSoc. Sec., 667 F.3d 356, 361 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Brown v. Astrue, 649 F.3d 193, 197 n.2 (3d\nCir. 2011)). Instead, the determination of RFC and disabilities are issues reserved for the\nCommissioner. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d).\n\nMoreover, \u201c[a] treating source\u2019s opinion is not entitled to controlling weight if it is\n\n209\n\n\u2018inconsistent with other substantial evidence in [the] case record.\u2019\u201d See Scouten v. Comm\u2019r of\nSoc. Sec., 722 F. App\u2019x 288, 290 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2)); see also\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2). If an ALJ chooses to reject the treating source\u2019s assessment, they\n\nmay do so only on the \u201cbasis of contradictory medical evidence\u201d not because of his or her \u201cown\n\ncredibility judgments, speculation or lay opinion.\u201d Morales, 225 F.3d at 317 (citing Plummer,\n\n\u20181 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927 was superseded by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920c for claims filed on or after\nMarch 27, 2017. Because Fayson\u2019s claim was filed prior to this date, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927\nremains in effect. See Kochaba v. Kijakazi, C.A. No. 20-367-SRF, 2021 WL 4502035, at *8 n.5\n(D. Del. Oct. 1, 2021).\n\n18\n186 F.3d at 429; Frankenfield v. Bowen, 861 F.2d 405, 408 (3d Cir. 1988); Kent v. Schweiker,\n710 F.2d 110, 115 (3d Cir. 1983)). An ALJ need not discuss every regulatory factor so long as\nthe ALJ provides \u201cgood reasons\u201d for the weight assigned to the treating source\u2019s opinion. See\nSSR 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *5 (\u201cthe adjudicator will always give good reasons...for the\nweight given to a treating source\u2019s medical opinion\u201d); see also Jones v. Barnhart, 364 F.3d 501,\n505 (3d Cir. 2004) (explaining that there is no requirement for \u201cthe ALJ to use particular\nlanguage or adhere to a particular format in conducting his analysis,\u201d but there must be\n\u201csufficient development of the record and explanation of findings to permit meaningful review\u201d).\n\nIn the case at bar, the ALJ found that Fayson had moderate limitations in understanding,\nremembering, or applying information, interacting with others, and in her ability to concentrate,\npersist, maintain pace, and adapt or manage herself. (D.I. 13-2 at 17-18) The ALJ found that the\nopinions suggesting severe or moderately severe work-related limitations were neither well-\nsupported nor consistent with Fayson\u2019s treatment records and self-reported activities of daily\nliving. (Id. at 21-23) The ALJ properly found the opinions were due reduced weight under the\nregulations, despite their consistency with one another. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(4)\n(\u201cGenerally, the more consistent a medical opinion is with the record as a whole, the more\nweight we will give to that medical opinion\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to afford the opinions of Dr. Simon, NP\nDavid, and Therapists Lowe and Darby limited or no weight. The ALJ gave limited weight to\nDr. Simon\u2019s opinion that Fayson had moderately severe limitations in sustaining work\nperformance and attendance, in part, because Fayson was not undergoing formal mental health\ntreatment at the time and, thus, no treatment records existed to support the opinion. (D.I. 13-2 at\n\n21) The ALJ observed that following her December 2016 SSI filing date, Fayson did not\n\n19\nparticipate in formal mental health treatment until her partial hospitalization in May 2017\nfollowing a relapse. (Jd. at 20-21; D.I. 21 at 9) The ALJ explained another basis for assigning\nlimited weight to the opinion by stating that the benign findings on mental status examinations\nfollowing the opinion, including those indicating Fayson had good memory, did not support this\nmoderately severe limitation. (D.I. 13-2 at 21) Additionally, Dr. Simon explains in his opinion\nthat Fayson \u201cis capable of interacting appropriately with others, performing simple tasks, and\navoiding hazard at work,\u201d has no problems maintaining concentration, focus, and attention, and\nis able to understand, follow, and carry out simple instructions. (D.I. 13-7 at 322-328)\nTherefore, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to give Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion limited\nweight.\n\nThe treatment records of NP David overlap in time with those of Therapists Lowe and\nDarby, but are inconsistent with one another. For example, NP David details overall stable and\nbenign findings on mental status examinations, including normal mood and affect, intact\nmemory, normal speech, and normal judgment concerning everyday activities and social\nsituations. (D.I. 13-8 at 375-379, 385-392, 401-404, 412-415, 428-431, 452-454, 457)\nHowever, during that same period, Therapists Lowe and Darby detail that Fayson generally\nexhibited depressed, negativistic, gloomy and tense mood, blunted or flat affect, poor judgment\nconcerning everyday activities and social situations, quiet speech, and marginally cooperative\nand guarded attitude. (/d. at 405-411, 416-427, 432-451, 455-463) Moreover, NP David\u2019s\nopinion that Fayson had moderately severe work-related limitations is inconsistent with her\ntreatment records from the same day, which detailed overall stable and benign findings,\nincluding normal mood and affect, intact memory, and normal judgment and insight. (/d. at 293-\n\n295, 452-454)\n\n20\nCiting the foregoing treatment records and opinions, the ALJ addressed the limitations\nexpressed in Dr. Simon, NP David, and Therapists Lowe and Darby\u2019s opinions. The record\ncontains treatment records inconsistent with opinions provided on the basis of Fayson\u2019s course of\ntreatment. The ALJ may afford less weight to these opinions, as they are neither well-supported\nnor consistent with the record as a whole. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2)-(4) ; see also Plummer,\n186 F.3d at 429.\n\nDr. Keaveney and Dr. Sandrian\u2019s opinions are subject to the treating physician doctrine,\nbut are likewise unsupported by the totality of the record establishing overall stable, benign\nfindings on mental status examinations.!? See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2)-(4). For example, Dr.\nKeaveney opined in her December 2018 opinion that Fayson\u2019s \u201cmental illness is severe and\ndebilitating, interferes with her sleep, concentration, and energy\u201d and that her \u201cdepression and\nPTSD interferes with her concentration and memory...she is easily distracted and would be\nunable to reliably stay on task.\u201d! (D.I. 13-8 at 339-341) However, Dr. Keaveney\u2019s October and\nNovember 2018 treatment records noted that, despite exhibiting a depressed mood and blunted\naffect, Fayson\u2019s memory seemed intact, she was alert, oriented, and cooperative, with normal\njudgment concerning everyday activities and social situations, normal insight and speech, and no\nsuicidal or homicidal ideations or hallucinations. (/d. at 393-400)\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Sandrian opined in July 2019 that Fayson \u201cis unable to get out of bed most\n\ndays, barely prepares her own meals, bathing and self hygiene...only occurs about 2x a week\u201d\n\n'2 Fayson also contends that Drs. Keaveney and Sandrian are \u201cspecialists,\u201d such that their\nopinions are due greater weight under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(5), but does explain why these\nproviders should be considered specialists, and Fayson\u2019s brief indicates that Dr. Sandrian is a\nprimary care physician, not a mental health specialist. (D.I. 18 at 6, 15)\n\n3 The law is well-established that medical source opinions regarding whether a claimant is\ndisabled or unable to work are reserved for the Commissioner and are not given any weight. See\nMoore v. Colvin, 239 F. Supp. 3d 845, 859 (D. Del. 2017).\n\n21\nand that Fayson \u201creports poor short term memory \u2014 forgets what she is saying midsentence, and\nhas difficulty maintaining focus.\u201d (Jd. at 474-476) However, Fayson\u2019s treatment records\ncontinually reported that she appeared well groomed, and Fayson reported that she has no\ndifficulty with personal care or preparing simple meals. (D.I. 13-6 at 28-30; D.I. 13-2 at 65; D.I.\n13-7 at 324-328; D.I. 13-8 at 369-463) Further, Fayson\u2019s treatment records during the period\nsurrounding Dr. Sandrian\u2019s opinion show that Fayson exhibited intact and normal immediate,\nrecent, and remote memory. (D.I. 13-8 at 432-463)\n\nCiting to exhibits from these treating providers, the ALJ directly addressed the limitations\nexpressed in Drs. Keaveney and Sandrian\u2019s opinions and articulated why she found them to be\ninconsistent with the evidence in the record. Further, there is no requirement that the ALJ\nspecifically list and discuss each regulatory factor in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c). See SSR 96-2p,\n1996 WL 374188, at *5; see also Jones, 364 F.3d at 505. The ALJ\u2019s assessment of these\nopinions allows for meaningful review and is supported by substantial evidence. See Scouten,\n722 F. App\u2019x at 290 (\u201c[a] treating source\u2019s opinion is not entitled to controlling weight if it is\n\u2018inconsistent with other substantial evidence in [the] case record\u201d); see also Laurie Sternberg v.\nComm\u2019r of Social Sec., 438 Fed. App\u2019x 89, 98 (3d Cir. 2011) (\u201cthe ALJ did not act improperly in\naffording [treating physician\u2019s] opinion \u2018little or no weight\u2019\u201d where the objective medical\nevidence in the record contradicted the opinion); see also Hoyman v. Colvin, 606 F. App\u2019x 678,\n680-81 (3d Cir. 2015) (holding that the ALJ correctly discounted a treating source\u2019s medical\nopinion after finding it inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own notes and objective evidence in the\nrecord).\n\nAdditionally, Fayson argues that the ALJ improperly relied on the consultative opinions\n\nof Drs. Singh, King, and Miripol. (D.I. 18 at 17-19) Specifically, Fayson argues that Dr.\n\n22\nSingh\u2019s opinion establishes greater limitations than those reflected in the RFC because Dr. Singh\nindicated that Fayson had moderate to moderately severe limitations in her ability to perform\nwork requiring frequent contact with others and in completing complex tasks. (Jd. at 17-18)\nHowever, the ALJ restricted Fayson, in part, to simple, routine and repetitive tasks, and the VE\nconfirmed that the identified jobs could be performed if the hypothetical individual was further\nlimited to occasional interaction with supervisors and coworkers, rather than frequent interaction.\n(D.I. 13-2 at 18-19, 75)\n\nFayson also argues that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the opinions of state agency psychological\nconsultants Drs. King and Miripol was improper because they conducted their reviews before the\nrecord was complete, in March 2017 and March 2018, respectively. (D.I. 18 at 18-19) However,\nthese opinions are not due less weight simply because the consultants conducted their reviews at\nan earlier stage in the administrative process and before the record closed. See Chandler v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d 356, 361 (3d Cir. 2011) (finding that \u201cbecause state agency\nreview precedes ALJ review, there is always some time lapse between the consultant\u2019s report\nand the ALJ hearing and decision. The Social Security regulations impose no limit on how much\ntime may pass between a report and the ALJ\u2019s decision in reliance on it\u201d). Moreover, the ALJ,\nciting to the record, found that the opinions of the state agency psychological consultants were\ninternally consistent and well supported by a reasonable explanation and the available evidence\nat the time of their determinations. (D.I. 13-2 at 21,24) Specifically, the ALJ noted that \u201cthe\nmental status examinations throughout the relevant period have consistently been within the\nclaimant\u2019s functional limitations, other than depressed and anxious moods, including during\nperiods when she reported she had not been taking her medications.\u201d (Id. at 24, citing D.I. 13-7\n\nat 239-251, D.I. 13-8 at 167-181, 206-212, 369-463)\n\n23\nFinally, to the extent Fayson contends that objective medical evidence may also exist to\nsupport the severe or moderately severe work-related limitations described in the discounted\nopinions, it is not for the court to re-weigh the medical opinions in the record, but rather to\n\u201cdetermine whether substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s weighing of those\nopinions.\u201d Ransom v. Berryhill, C.A. No. 17-939-LPS, 2018 WL 3617944, at *7 (D. Del. July\n30, 2018) (citing Gonzalez v. Astrue, 537 F. Supp. 2d 644, 659 (D. Del. 2008)); see also\nRutherford y. Barnhart, 399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d Cir. 2005) (the court \u201cmay not weigh the\nevidence or substitute [its] conclusions for those of the fact-finder\u2019\u201d\u2019). Here, substantial evidence\nexists to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.
