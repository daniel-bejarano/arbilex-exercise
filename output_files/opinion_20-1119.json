Bosick \n(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) to Magistrate Judge  Fallon\u2019s October 15, 2021 Report and Recommendation (D.I. 19) \n(\u201cthe Report\u201d).  The Report recommended ( 1) denying Plaintiff\u2019s motion for  summary judgment \n(D.I. 13) and (2) granting Defendant\u2019s cross -motion for summary judgment (D.I. 14).  The Court \nhas reviewed the Report (D.I. 19), Plaintiff\u2019s objections (D.I. 20 ) and Defendant\u2019s response thereto \n(D.I. 23), and the Court has considered de  novo the objected -to portions of the Report , the relevant \nportions of the motions , and supporting documentation (D.I. 13, 14, 15, 18) .  For the reasons set \nforth below, Plaintiff\u2019s objections are OVERRULED, the Report is ADOPTED, Plaintiff\u2019s motion \nfor summary judgment (D.I. 13) is DENIED, and Defendant\u2019s cross -motion  for summary judgment \n(D.I.  14) is GRANTED.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe Report sets forth a detailed description of the procedural history, medical history, and \nthe proceeding before the Administrative Law Judge .  (See D.I. 19 at 2-12).  The parties have not \nobjected to any of those sections of the Report and the Court  finds no error in those sections.  T he \nCourt therefore adopts those sections  and incorporates them here:  \nA. Procedural History  \nBosick protectively filed a DIB appli cation on February 8, \n2017, alleging a disability onset date of June 14, 2013 due to knee \ninjuries.   (D.I. 10 at 144- 49)  Bosick\u2019s  claims were denied initially \nin March 2017 and again on reconsideration in June 2017.  ( Id. at \n74, 85)  At Bosick\u2019s  request , an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) \nheld a hearing on May 6, 2019.  ( Id. at 35 -61)  T he ALJ issued an \nunfavorable decision on May 21, 2019, finding th at Bosick was not \ndisabled under the Act because she could perform a reduced range of sedentary work.  ( Id. at 23 -27)  The Appeals Council \nsubsequently denied Bosick\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s \ndecision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner.  ( Id. at 7-9)   2 Bosick brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s \ndecision  on August 26, 2020.  (D.I. 1)  Bosick filed her pending \nmotion for summary judgment  on May 19, 2021 (D.I. 13), and the \nCommissioner cross -moved for summary judgment on June 11, \n2021 (D.I. 14).  Briefing is now complete. \n \nB. Medical History  \nBosick was 46 years old on December 31, 2013, her date last \ninsured.  (D.I. 10 at 26, 62)  Bosick has a college degree and has past \nrelevant work as a customer service representative, an elementary school teacher, and a substitute teacher.  ( Id. at 43 -44)  The ALJ \nfound that Bosic k had the following severe impairments: bilateral \nknee disorder, obesity, and sleep apnea.  ( Id. at 21)  Bosick \nchallenges the ALJ\u2019s consideration of her knee condition, the weight given to the opinions of non- examining agency physicians, and the \nassessmen t of her subjective complaints of pain.  (D.I. 13; D.I. 18)  \nBecause Bosick d oes not challenge the ALJ\u2019s decision regarding her \nobesity and sleep apnea, the court does not address those conditions here.  \n 1. Medical evidence  \nOn June 14, 2013, Bosick tripped on  uneven flooring and fell \nwhile she was shopping, sustaining injuries to her knees .  (D.I. 10 at \n44; D.I. 11 at 66)  Ten days later, Bosick treated with Michael Axe, \nM.D., an orthopedic surgeon, for bilateral knee pain.  (D.I. 11 at 66-67)  Dr. Axe noted t hat Bosick\u2019s pain increased with bending, \nclimbing stairs, movement, sitting, walking, and standing, and she experienced decreased mobility, limping, numbness, spasms, swelling, tingling, bruising, and weakness in her legs.  ( Id. at 66)  \nAn x -ray revealed post-ACL reconstruction in her left knee with \nanteromedial changes, and her right knee showed degeneration of the medial compartment following ACL reconstruction.  ( Id. at 66, \n111-14)  Dr. Axe indicated there was no effus ion.  ( Id. at 66)  He \nexplained tha t she could perform activities as tolerated, and he \nordered MRIs of both knees.  ( Id. at 66 -67)  Dr. Axe prescribed a \ntopical gel and medication for the pain, and he suggested that they discuss bracing her legs after rece iving her MRI results.  ( Id. at 67)    \n On July 1, 2013, Bosick visited Dr. Axe to review her MRI \nresults, which showed mild partial tearing of her right ACL, a right lateral meniscus tear, and loss of medial and patellofemoral components indicative of dege nerative arthritis with a partial r adial \ntear of the medial meniscus in her left knee.  (D.I. 11 at 68, 733- 34)  \nDr. Axe diagnosed Bosick with a meniscus tear and degenerative 3 arthritis of the knee, including cartilage loss under her left kneecap.  \n(Id.)  He discussed the possibility of an a rthroscopic debridement \nand possible lateral release of the left knee and addressed the cartilage loss and possible meniscus tear in her right knee.  ( Id.)  Dr. \nAxe represented that Bosick would be \u201ctotally disabled for the next \n2 weeks\u201d and recommended pool and land therapy, with the goal of \nimproving her range of motion and strength.  ( Id.) \n \nBosick began physical therapy on July 2, 2013 to treat her \nbilateral knee pain, increase her strength and range of motion, and improve her gait.  (D.I. 11 at 317)  P hysical therapy progress notes \nfrom July 2013 indicate that Bosick benefited from the use of the knee brace, but she still experienced pain and swelling  in her left \nknee.  (D.I. 11 at 302)  Aquatic therapy he lped her gain strength \nwithout pain, and her topi cal pain cream was effective.  ( Id.)  \nBosick\u2019s range of motion and strength improved bilaterally, but her gait remained abnormal.  ( Id.)  She reported difficulty standing from \na seated position, climbing sta irs, repetitive standing, and walking.  \n(Id.)   \n In mid -July 2013, Dr. Axe gave Bosick a lidocaine injection \nin her left knee and prescribed the use of a knee immobilizer so she would have \u201cthe ability to walk with a straight leg.\u201d  ( Id. at 69)  At \nthe end  of July, Dr. Axe noted improvement with therapy and a \nhome stimulation unit, and he observed that she had no effusion.  (Id. at 70)  Dr. Axe recommended reducing their visits from \nbiweekly to once a month, and  he reduced her use of the home \nstimulation un it from three times a day to twice a day.  ( Id.)  At \nBosick\u2019s visit in August 2013, Dr. Axe noted tears in both menisci of Bosick\u2019s left knee and recommended surgical intervention to release the ligament and repair the meniscus. ( Id.at 71 )  Dr. Axe \nindicat ed that Bosick had been in the knee immobilizer f or too long \nand she felt that she was dependent on it.  ( Id.)   \n On September 12, 2013, Bosick underwent surgery on her \nleft knee for a torn meniscus .  The surgery included a partial \nsynovectomy with lysis of adhesions, a partial medial meniscectomy, chond roplasty, and lateral release.  ( D.I. 11 at 115-\n16)  The following week, Dr. Axe noted that, although Bosick \nexperienced intermittent pain, she was responding to medication and her status had improved post -surgery.  ( Id. at 73)  He performed two \naspiratio ns on her left knee following her surgery in September \n2013.  ( Id. at 73, 75)  Dr. Axe indicated that Bosick was to be \nconsidered \u201ctotally disabled\u201d until her return visit in three weeks.  (Id. at 75, 106- 07)   4 In October 2013, Dr. Axe noted that Bosick wa s \u201ctracking \nbetter,\u201d had \u201cless effusion,\u201d and was \u201cprogressing nicely\u201d at \nphysical therapy.  (D.I. 11 at 76)  Bosick used crutches, but Dr. Axe indicated that the physical therapist  could switch her to a cane at any \npoint.  ( Id.)  Bosick was prescribed Per cocet and Voltaren gel to \nmanage her pain.  ( Id.)  Dr. Axe emphasized a focus on improving \nBosick\u2019s strength before she returned to work.  ( Id.)  Physical \ntherapy notes from October 2013 indicate that Bosick made progress and felt better after her sessions , and she exhibited improved \nwalking, improved tolerance for activities of daily living, and \nincreased ability to stand.  ( Id. at 279- 86) \n In November 2013, Dr. Axe indicated that Bosick was able \nto go back t o work at a \u201cdesk- type\u201d position that would not r equire \nkneeling, squatting, or crawling.  (D.I. 11 at 77)  Dr. Axe observed that Bosick could perform a straight leg raise, and he reported that she continued to attend physical therapy and take Percocet and  \nVoltaren.  ( Id.)  During physical therapy that m onth, Bosick\u2019s \nprogress report indicated  that she was \u201cmaking good progress \ntowards [a] return to full function,\u201d and despite a continued deficit in knee flexion, she exhibited an improved range of motion and \nstrength.  ( Id. at 272)   She was able to use a cane instead of crutches \nto ambulate  at home, and her gait improved after she was fitted for \na brace.  ( Id. at 268-72)     \n \nOn December 11 and 27, 2013, Bosick received injections  \nof lidocaine, Kenalog, and Supartz for pain, and Dr. Axe suggested that her  discomfort would improve as she regained her strength.  \n(D.I. 11 at 78, 80)  Dr. Axe indicated that Bosick could perform activities as tolerated.  ( Id. at 80)  Bosick mostly repor ted feeling \nbetter during her physical therapy sessions  after receiving the \ninjections , and she indicated that she had stopped using her cane at \nhome.  ( Id. at 257- 62)  The physical therapist noted improved \nmovement in her patella.  ( Id. at 257)  \n Bosick co ntinued to treat with Dr. Axe in 2014, following \nher date last insured.  She  received multiple bilateral knee injections \nof Supartz in January 2014.  (D.I. 11 at 81- 84)  Bosick returned to \nDr. Axe in March 2014, complaining of occasional bilateral knee pain that was worse on the left side.  ( Id. at 85 -86)  Dr. Axe reviewed \nx-rays that revealed degenerative arthritis.  ( Id.)  He recommended \ntreating the pain with medication and suggested that she might require a knee replacement in the future.  ( Id. at 86)  By April 2014, \nBosick described her pain as constant, aching, sharp, and thr obbing.  \n(Id. at 87)  However, Dr. Axe suggested that Bosick had \u201cturned the \ncorner\u201d with her current treatment of X2 cream and Meloxicam 5 because it allowed her to focus on getting her strength back which, \nin turn, would increase her functionality.  ( Id.)  He indicated that her \nneed for a cane was up for debate, and she \u201ccertainly can return . . . \nto work in which she has a desk job.\u201d  ( Id. at 87, 105)  In June 2014, \nDr. Axe reporte d that Bosick continued to get better and had shown \n50% improvement despite a 40.8 deficit in peak torque , down from \na deficit of 49.1 in September 2013, and he anticipated that she would improve further with continued treatment.  ( Id. at 88, 746- 47)  \nHe p rescribed five weeks of Supartz injections and renewed her \nprescription for M eloxicam.  ( Id. at 89)   \n Bosick was discharged from physical therapy on July 18, \n2014.  (D.I. 11 at 203)  During her treatment in June and July 2014, Bosick reported feeling bett er, she had an easier time performing \nactivities of daily living , and she exhibited improved strength and \nwalking.  ( Id. at 205- 12)  Although she performed a mix of land and \naquatic therapy exercises between January and May 2014, her treatment no longer included aquatic exercises by June 2014.  ( Id. at \n205-06) \n Bosick completed he r Supartz injections in September 2014, \nabout a year after her surgery.  (D.I. 11 at 95)  She complained of aching , burning pain in both knees, but she did acknowledge some \nimprovement from the injections.  ( Id.)  There are no further records \nfrom Dr. Axe\u2019s  office until March 2016, when Bosick prese nted \nwith bilateral knee pain and swelling, and x- rays revealed end -stage \nosteoarthritis in both knees.  ( Id. at 97)  Bosick underwent a total \nknee replacement of her left knee on April 22, 2016.  ( Id. at 99, 117-\n18)  Her physical therapy discharge notes f rom October 2016 \nindicate that Bosick had \u201cmade objective improvements with Strength, as well as shown improvements with Gait, Weight Bearing.\u201d  ( Id. at 135)   \n 2. Medical opinions  \nDuring the course of his treatment  of Bosick, Dr. Axe \nperiodically opined on h er capacity to work.  Dr. Axe represented \nthat Bosick was unable to work from July 2013 through the period following her September 2013 surgery.  (D.I. 11 at 107- 10)  On \nOctober 21, 2013, Dr. Axe opined that Bosi ck was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d \nand could do \u201cno w ork\u201d until her next office visit.  ( Id. at 106)  The \nfollowing month, Dr. Axe suggested  that Bosick could not return to \nprevious work that involved kneeling, squatting, or crawling, but he recommended that she co nsult with an employment counselor to \nfind a ppropriate work given her age.  ( Id. at 77)  In April 2014, Dr. \nAxe explained that Bosick could not squat, climb, crawl, or stoop, 6 and could not stand or walk for more than ten minutes per hour, but \nhe cleared he r for desk duty.  ( Id. at 105)   \n Dr. Michael H. Borek, D.O., a state agency physician, \nreviewed Bosick\u2019s medical records and performed a residual \nfunctional capacity analysis based on those written records on \nMarch 13, 2017.  (D.I. 10 at 62- 72)  Dr. Borek  found Bosick\u2019s \nstatements regarding her symptoms to be partially consistent with \nthe objective medical evidence, but he noted that surgery and physical therapy resulted in improvement to Bosick\u2019s knee pain and her ability to perform activities of daily living.  ( Id. at 67)  He opined \nthat she  was restricted to occasionally and frequently lifting and \ncarrying ten pounds, standing and walking for two hours in an eight -\nhour workday, and sitting for a total of six hours, among additional restrictions in her lo wer extremities.  ( Id. at 68)  As a re sult, Dr. \nBorek opined that Bosick was not disabled and was restricted to sedentary work.  ( Id. at 71)   \n State agency physician Darrin Campo, M.D. evaluated \nBosick\u2019s written medical records at the reconsideration level  on \nJune 6, 2017.  (D.I. 10 at 75- 84)  On appeal, Bosick indicated that \nshe had greater difficulty walking, increased pain and deterioration in her right knee, and limping on her right side.  ( Id. at 80)  Dr. \nCampo confirmed that Bosick exhibited an antal gic gait and limited \nrange of motion t hat improved after  undergoing arthroscopic \nsurgery for a meniscal tear.  ( Id.)  Dr. Campo opined that Bosick \notherwise exhibited normal lower extremity strength and sensation, and subsequent medical evidence fell outsi de the period of \nadjudication.  ( Id.)  Consequently, Dr. Campo adopted the initial \ndetermination regarding Bosick\u2019s claim and concluded that she was not disabled.  ( Id. at 80, 83)  \n 3. Nonmedical evidence \nOn February 24, 2017, Bosick completed a function repor t.  \n(D.I. 10 at 211 -18)  In the report , she described how fatigue, pain, \nand discomfort prevent her from working because these symptoms limit her ability to sit, stand, walk, and concentrate.  ( Id. at 211)  \nBosick reported that she spends her days going to physical therapy, \ndoing exercises, and elevating and icing her leg in addition to watching television and attending to her personal hygiene.  ( Id. at \n212)  Although she indicated that she could dr ess and bathe herself, \nshe said that these tasks are difficult and painful, and she does them less frequently.  ( Id.)  She explained that she can no longer climb \nstairs, do housework, or walk, stand, or sit for long periods.  ( Id.)  \nHer pain interfered wit h her ability to sleep.  ( Id.)  Bosick reported 7 that she is  able to prepare her own meals and drive a car, but she can \nonly walk a few feet without the assistance of a cane.  (D.I. 10 at \n213-14, 216- 17) \n \nC. Hearing Before the ALJ  \nAt the administrative hearing  on May 6, 2019, Bosick \nrepresented herself.  (D.I. 10 at 37)  The ALJ carefully explained Bosick\u2019s rights and offered to postpone the hearing should Bosick wish to seek representation.  ( Id. at 37 -38)  Specifically, the ALJ \nexplained that \u201c[a] representat ive could help you obtain information \nabout your claim, expl ain medical terms, help protect your rights \nand make any request or give any notice about the proceeding before me.\u201d  ( Id.)  Bosick was advised that some organizations offer legal \nrepresentation f ree of charge.  ( Id. at 37)  Bosick was further advised \nthat, if her claim was ultimately denied, she could appeal it on her \nown or with a representative, and she could file a new application on her own or with a representative.  ( Id. at 39)  Bosick confir med \nthat she understood and agreed to proceed without couns el.\n1  (Id.)   \n 1. Bosick \u2019s Testimony  \nUpon questioning by the ALJ, Bosick testified that she lives \nby herself, she drives a car, and she has a college degree.  (D.I. 10 at 43)  She previously worked a s a customer service representative, \nan elementary school te acher, and a substitute teacher.  ( Id. at 43 -\n44)  She stopped working in 2013 after falling and injuring her knees.  ( Id. at 44 -45)  Bosick explained that she suffered from \ndegenerative arthritis in her knees before the fall, and she underwent surgery thre e months after the fall.  ( Id. at 45)  She stated that she \nlost the muscle in her left leg during the time between her fall and \n \n1  In her brief, Bosick states, \u201cI do not have a lawyer.  This is one of the reasons that I feel \ndiscriminated against in this case.\u201d  (D.I. 1 3 at 2)  The ALJ  has a heightened level of care \nand responsibility to assume a more active role when the claimant  is unrepresented.  \nDobrowolsky v. Califano, 606 F.2d 403 (3d Cir. 1979).  The ALJ did so here, inf orming \nBosick that, \u201c[b]ecause you ar e not r epresented, I\u2019ll  make sure that your due process rights \nare protected and obtain any evidence that may be needed. \u201d  (D .I. 10 at 39)  The ALJ is not \nrequired to act as the claimant\u2019s counsel, and \u201c[l]ack of counse l alone is not sufficient for \nremand. \u201d  Conl ey v. Colvin , C.A . No. 15- 722-RGA- MPT , 2016 WL 3436435, at *10 (D. \nDel. June 20, 2016) (citing Domozik v. Cohen, 413 F .2d 5, 9 (3d Cir. 1969)).  Here, the \nALJ added new evidence presented by Bosick to her file and elicited testimony from Bosick, Bos ick\u2019s m other, and the V E regarding Bosick\u2019s impairments, the extent of those \nimpairments on her ability to work, and her  medi cal treatment.  (D.I. 10 at 39 -60)  On these \nfacts, the ALJ fulfilled his duty to develop the record and provide a full and fair administr ative hearing fo r Bosick.   8 her surgery, and she could not sleep because of the severity of the \npain.  ( Id.)  She tried returning to work in 2015 and 2016, but she \nonly did occasional substitute teaching due to the swelling and pain in her legs.  ( Id. at 45 -46)  She described having difficulty going up \nand down stairs, walking, sitting for long periods, standing, turning, \ngetting in and out of a car, and slee ping.  ( Id. at 49)   \n \nBosick\u2019s mother, Ms. Caldwell, also testified at the hearing \nbefore the ALJ.  Ms. Caldwell said she visited her daughter a couple times a month throughout the relevant time period and described Bosick\u2019s pain as unrelenting.  ( Id. at 52)  She represented that Bosick \nsuffered pain from sitting in a chair, standing, walking, climbing stairs, and getting in and out of the shower, and she had seen no improvement over  the course of the relevant time period.  ( Id. at 53)  \nMs. Caldwell testifie d that she helped her daughter financially, \nemotionally, and spiritually during the relevant time period, recommending medications and buying things for Bosick to make her more com fortable.  ( Id.) \n 2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ  \nAt the adminis trative hearing in May 2019, t he ALJ posed \nthe following hypothetical to vocational expert Lanell Hall (\u201cthe \nVE\u201d):  \n \nPlease assume a hypothetical individual of \nthe Claimant\u2019s age and education with the past jobs \nthat you described.  Further assume that this  \nindividual is limited to a range of sedentary work.  The individual would require the use of an assistive device for ambulation, but would retain the use of the free hand for lifting and carrying.  The individual \nwould be limited to occasional use of foot  controls, \nno climbing of ropes, ladders, or scaffolds, no kneeling or crawling.  The individual would be limited to occasional climbing of ramps and stairs, occas ional balancing, stooping and crouching and \nlimited to occasional exposure to unprotected heights, moving mechanical parts, extreme \ntemperatures, humidity and vibration.  \n \n(D.I. 10 at 55- 56)  In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the \nVE testified that suc h a hypothetical individual would be able to \nperform  Bosick\u2019s past work as a customer complai nt clerk .  (Id. at \n56)  The VE further testified that the hypothetical individual could 9 perform the sedentary, unskilled jobs of order clerk, document \npreparer, an d touch- up screener.  ( Id.)   \n The ALJ asked the VE if an  employer for the customer \ncomplaint  clerk position would tolerate an employee being off task \ndue to pain.  ( Id. at 56 -57)  The VE responded that, if the \nhypothetical individual were off task 10% or more of the day, it would preclude Bosick\u2019s past work as a customer complaint clerk and would also preclude the unskilled, sedentary positions \nidentified.  ( Id. at 57)  The ALJ also inquired about employer \ntolerance for someone being absent from the workpl ace.  ( Id. at 59 -\n60)  The VE responded that, if a person is absent more than one day a month or more than eight times per year, it would preclude all work.  ( Id. at 60)   \n \nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings  \nBased on the factual evidence in the record and the testimony \nby Bosick  and the VE, the ALJ determined that  Bosick was not \ndisabled under the Act for the rele vant time period from the June 14, \n2013 disability onset date through the December 31, 2013 date l ast \ninsured.  ( D.I. 10 at 27)  The ALJ found, in pertinent part:  \n 1. The claimant  last met the insured status \nrequirements of the Social Security Act on \nDecember  31, 2013.  \n 2. The claimant did not engage in substantial gainful activity during the period from her alleged onset date of June 14, 2013 through her date last insured of December 31, 2013  \n(20 CFR 404.1571 et seq .). \n 3. Through the date last insured, t he claiman t \nhad the following severe impairments: \nbilateral knee disorder; obesity; and sleep apnea (20 C FR 404.1520(c)).  \n 4. Through the date last insured, t he claimant \ndid not have an impairment or combination \nof impairments that met or medically equaled  \nthe severity  of one of the listed impairments \nin 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d) , 404.1525 and \n404.1526). \n 10 5. After careful consideration of the entire \nrecord . . ., through the date last insured, the claimant had the residual functional capaci ty \nto perform sedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) except that she: required the use  of an assistive device for ambulation \nbut retained the use of the free hand for lifting and carrying; could occasionally climb ramps and stairs but needed to avoid climbing ropes, ladders or scaffolds; could occasionally balance, stoop and crouch but needed to avoid kneeling or crawling; and could have had occasional exposure to unprotected heights, moving mechanical parts, extreme temperatures, humidity, and vibr ation. \n 6. Through the date last insured, t he claimant \nwas capable of performing past relevant wo rk \nas a customer complaint clerk (DOT #241.367- 014, SVP 5, sedentary exertion as \ngenerally performed).  This work did not require the performance of work- related  \nactivities precluded by the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (20 CFR 404.1565). \n 7. The cl aimant was not under a disability, as \ndefined in the Social Security Act, at any time from June 14, 2013, the alleged onset date, through December 31, 2013, the date last insured (20 CFR 404.1520(f)).  \n  (D.I. 10 at 21- 27) \n(D.I. 19 at 2- 12 (emphases and some alterations in original) ). \nOn October 15, 2021, Judge Fallon issued the Report  recommending Plaintiff\u2019s motion for \nsummary judgment be denied and that Defendant \u2019s cross -motion for summary judgment be \ngranted.  (D.I. 19).  Plaintiff time ly objected to the Report (D.I. 2 0) and Defendant responded \n(D.I.  23).   11 II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nThe power vested in a federal magistrate judge varies depending on whether the issue  to \nbe decided  is dispositive or non- dispositive.  \u201cUnlike a nondispositive motion (such as a discovery \nmotion), a motion is dispositive if a decision on the motion would effectively determine a claim \nor defense of a party.\u201d  Equal Employment Opportunity Commiss ion v. City of Long Branch, 866 \nF.3d 93, 98-99 (3d Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).  For reports and recommendations issued for \ndispositive motions, \u201ca party may serve and file specific written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations\u201d within  fourteen days of the recommended disposition issuing and \u201c[t] he \ndistrict judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge\u2019s disposition that has been \nproperly objected to.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 72(b)( 2)-(3); see also  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 636(b)(1) (B)-(C); Brown \nv. Astrue , 649 F.3d 193, 195 (3d Cir. 2011).  When no timely objection is filed  (including a s to \nselect  portions of the report) , \u201cthe court need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the \nface of the record in order to accept the recom mendation.\u201d  F ED. R. CIV. P. 72(b) advisory \ncommittee notes to  1983 amendment.  \u201c[B]ecause a district court must take some action for a report \nand recommendation to become a final order and because \u2018[t]he authority and the responsibility to make an informe d, final determination . . . remains with the judge,\u2019 \u201d however , district courts are \nstill obligated to apply \u201creasoned consideration\u201d in such situations.  City of Long Branch, 866 F.3d \nat 99 -100 (citing Mathews v. Weber , 423 U.S. 261, 271 (1976); see also  Henderson v. Carlson, \n812 F.2d 874, 878 (3d Cir. 1987)) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nIn the  Report , Judge Fallon correctly determined that substantial evidence  supports the \nALJ\u2019s finding that Plaintiff could perform a range of sedentary work during the  short six- month \nwind ow between her alleged disability onset date and her date last insured .  (D.I. 19 at 14- 16).  See 12 Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, 1154 (2019) (explaining that substantial  evidence is an \nevidentiary threshold that is \u201cnot high\u201d and requires only \u201cmor e than a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence).  \nJudge Fallon discu ssed the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment, noting the  ALJ properly considered Plaintiff\u2019s \nsubjective complaints of pain, relevant treatment records,  and the medical opinions . (D.I. 19 at \n15).  In particular, sh e discussed that  the ALJ took into account evidence relate d to Plaintiff\u2019s \nlimited mobility, but also considered treatment notes showing Plaintiff\u2019s increased range of motion \nand strength in the months  following her meniscus surgery.  (Id. at 15 -16).  Judge  Fallon also \ncorrectly observed that  the RFC accounted fo r Plaintiff\u2019s use of an assistive device for walking. \n(Id. at 15).  Additionally, Judge Fallon addressed the ALJ\u2019s finding that Plaintiff\u2019s allegations  were \nnot entirely consistent with the overall e vidence in the record .  (D.I. 19 at  20).  She noted that the \nALJ\u2019s decision to discount Plaintiff\u2019s subjective complaints  was based on \u201cconsideration of the \nobjective medical evidence and other evidence of  record .\u201d  (Id. at 21).  \nThis Court has reviewed de  novo the issues addressed in the Report.  Having reviewed all \nof the evidence and keeping in mind the \u201cnot high\u201d substantial evidence standard ( Biestek, 139 S. \nCt. at 1154) that requires a reviewing court to \u201cdefer[] to  the presiding ALJ, who has seen the  \nhearing up close\u201d) , the Court agrees with the recommendation of the Report.  The ALJ\u2019s decision \nis AFFIRMED . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court overrules Plaintiff\u2019s objections , adopts the Report , \ndenies Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary ju dgment , and grants Defendant\u2019s cross -motion for \nsummary judgment . \nAn appropriate order will follow.  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF D ELAWARE  \n \nLESLIE S.
