{"case_name": "USA v. Perez-Minaya", "case_number": "21-18", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "01-04-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  \nP\nlaintiff,  \nv. \nCA\nRLOS J. PEREZ- MINAYA  \nDefendant.  Criminal No. 21-1 8-CFC \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nD\nefendant Carlos J . Perez- Minaya has moved to suppress \u201call evidence \ngathered as a result of\u201d a traffic stop of his car made by a Delaware State Trooper \non February 23, 2021.  D.I. 19 at 3.  The Trooper who stopped Perez- Minaya\u2019s car \ndid not personally observe the car violate a traffic law.  The Trooper executed the \ncar stop at the request of another law enforcement officer who had observed the car \nviolate a traffic law.  Officers searched the car after Perez- Minaya  exited it.  They \nfound evidence in the car that linked Perez- Minaya to a cocaine distribution \nconspiracy and arrested him on the scene.  During a post -arrest interview, Perez-\nMinaya consented to a search of his house .  Officers found there a kilogram of \ncocaine.  Perez- Minaya argues that all this the evidence \u201cshould be excluded for \nuse by the Government at trial\u201d because \u201c [t]he stop and [ Perez-M inaya\u2019s]  \n2 \n subsequent arrest w [ere]  done in violation of Section 701(a)(1) [ of the Delaware \nCode. ]\u201d  Id.     \nWith limited exceptions not applicable here, s ection 701(a)(1) authorizes \nDelaware State Troopers to make an arrest for a traffic law violation  only if the \nviolation is \u201c committed in their presence. \u201d  21 Del.  Code \u00a7 701(a)(1).   The \ngovernme nt does not dispute that the traffic stop and Perez -Minaya\u2019s arrest \nviolated section 701(a)(1).  It argues, however, that section 701(a)(1) \u201cdoes not \napply here\u201d and that \u201c [t]he only pertinent question is whether [the Delaware State \nPolice] had reasonable suspicion to conduct the traffic stop.\u201d  D.I. 20 at 8. \nThe government is correct.  The question here is not whether the stop was \nauthorized by section 701(a)(1).  The question is rather whether the car stop was \nreasonable under the Fou rth Amendment.  See Cooper v. State of Cal ., 386 U.S. \n58, 61 (1967) (\u201c[T]he question here is not whether the  search was authorized by \nstate law.  The question is rather whether the search was reasonable under the \nFourth Amendment.   Just as a search authorized by state law may be an \nunreasonable one under that amendment, so may a search not expressly authorized \nby state law be justified as a constitutionally reasonable one. \u201d).  Whether the stop \nof Perez -Minaya\u2019s car was lawful under section 701(a)(1) is irrelevant.  Id.; see \nalso Virginia v. Moore , 553 U.S. 164, 171 (2008).   \n3 \n The Supreme Court has \u201c firmly rejected the argument \u2018 that reasonable cause \nfor a[n investigative stop] can only be based on the officer\u2019 s personal observation, \nrather than on information supplied by another person. \u2019\u201d  Navarette v. California , \n572 U.S. 393, 397 (2014) (quoting Adams v. Williams,  407 U.S. 143, 147 (1972)) \n(alterations in the original).   And the Court established in Whren v. United States,  \n517 U.S. 806 (1996), \u201c a bright -line rule that any technical violation of a traffic \ncode legitimizes a stop  [under the Fourth Amendment], even if the stop is merely \npretext for an investigation of some other crime.\u201d  United States v. Mosley , 454 \nF.3d 249, 252 (3d Cir. 2006).   \nIt is undisputed here that a law enforcement officer observed Perez -\nMinaya\u2019s car violate a traffic law on February 23, 2021.  Accordingly, reasonable \nsuspicion existed to stop Perez -Minaya\u2019s car , and the stop was lawful under the \nFourth Amendment.    \nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington  on this Third day of January in 2022, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s Motion to  Suppress Evidence (D.I. \n19) is DENIED . \n \n \n_________________________________ \nCHIEF  JUDGE \n \n"}
