No. 21-1490-CFC\n\nDISCIPLINARY COUNSEL PATRICIA\nB. SWARTZ, etal.,\n\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n\nPro se Plaintiff Meghan Kelly is a Delaware attorney. Defendants are the\nDelaware Board on Professional Responsibility (the Board), the Office of Disciplinary\nCounsel of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware (the ODC), the ODC's counsel,\nthe Preliminary Review Committee (PRC), and the Delaware Attorney General.\nPlaintiff filed this action on October 25, 2021 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985\nand Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. She sought an order \"to enjoin proceedings\nbrought by the Defendants to place [her] attorney license on inactive disabled\" status in\nviolation of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. (D.1. 2] 14) On November 2,\n2021, the Court denied Plaintiffs motion to expedite and letter/motion for emergency\nrelief, dismissed as moot motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary\ninjunction, to e-file and to appear remotely; abstained under the Younger abstention\ndoctrine; and dismissed the Complaint. (D.I. 16, 17)\n\nOn November 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for reargument (construed as a\n\nmotion for reconsideration), followed by a motion to amend the motion for reargument, a\nmotion to amend Exhibit G to the Complaint, and a letter asking me to consider new\nevidence. (D.I. 20, 21, 23,29) On December 22, 2021, this Court granted Plaintiff's\nmotion to amend the motion for reargument, considered the amended reargument\nconstrued as a motion for reconsideration, did not consider evidence that did not exist\nwhen Plaintiff commenced this action on October 25, 2021, denied as moot Plaintiff's\nmotion to amend Exhibit G of the complaint as it was already in the record, and denied\nPlaintiffs motion for reconsideration. (D.I. 30, 31)\n\nOn January 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of the December 22, 2021\nMemorandum and Order. (D.I. 21) On January 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion to\nwaive PACER costs due to utter poverty. (D.I.33) The same day she filed a motion\nto amend findings of fact and alter the December 22, 2021 Order to include the\navailability of new evidence not previously available, to correct clear errors of law and\nfact, and to prevent manifest injustice. (D.I. 34 at 1) The Court construes the filing as\na motion for reconsideration of the December 22, 2021 order denying Plaintiff's motion\nfor reconsideration.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the United State Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in\nKelly v. Disciplinary Counsel Swartz, No. 21-3198 at docket item 22 (3d Cir.) stayed the\nappeal pending this Court\u2019s decision on the motion to amend pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52 and 59 filed on January 11, 2022. (See D.I. 34) Since then, Plaintiff has filed: (1) a\nthird emergency motion to alter and amend the December 22, 2021 judgment pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b), 59(e), 60(b)(1), (2), and (6), and 65 (D.I. 36); (2) an emergency\n\nmotion for immediate relief requesting review of motion filed simultaneously herewith\n(D.I. 37); (3) a second additional motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(b), 59(e), and\n60(b)(1), (2), and 6) to amend findings of facts and alter the order dated December 22,\n2021 based on new findings of fact, to prevent clear error of facts, clear error of law,\nand to prevent manifest injustice (D.1. 39); (4) a third emergency motion pursuant to\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(b), 59(e), 60(b)(1), (2), and (6), and 65 (D.I. 41); (5) an emergency\nmotion for immediate relief requesting review of motion filed simultaneously herewith\n(D.I. 42); (6) a motion for an urgent emergency preliminary restraining order to be\napplied immediately with a waiver of bond to prevent immediate and irreparable injury\nby compelled violations of my religion but for my exercise of religious belief (D.1. 47); (7)\na motion to expedite (D.I. 48); and (8) a different motion for exemption to appear in\nperson in court, for remote proceedings or to appear remotely due to foreseeable costs\nrelating to transportation creating a substantial burden upon plaintiff's access to the\ncourts and forced violation of her religious beliefs by threat of indebtedness (D.I. 54).\nUl. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff seeks relief under Rule 52(b) and 59(e). A motion under Rule 52(b) or\n59(e) is the functional equivalent of a motion for reconsideration. Butamax Advanced\nBiofuels LLC v. Gevo Inc., 2015 WL 4919975, at *1, (D. Del. Aug. 18, 2015). Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 52(b) provides that, no later than 28 days after the entry of\njudgment, a party may move to have the court \u201camend its findings \u2014 or make additional\nfindings,\u201d and the Rule 52(b) motion may accompany a motion for new trial under Rule\n59. Rule 52(b) \u201cpermits [a party] to ask the court to correct, on the non-jury record\n\nbefore it, any errors of law, mistakes of fact or oversights that require correction.\u201d U.S.\nGypsum Co. v. Schiavo Bros., Inc., 668 F.2d 172, 180 (3d Cir. 1981). Factual\ndeterminations are correctable under Rule 52(b) if the district judge who heard the\nevidence believes that they are necessary, and capable of being made without the grant\nof anew trial. U. S. Gypsum Co. v. Schiavo Bros., 668 F.2d 172, 180 n.9 (3d Cir.\n1981)\n\nA motion for reconsideration/amendment of judgment filed pursuant to Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 59(e) is \u201ca device to relitigate the original issue decided by the\ndistrict court, and [it is] used to allege legal error.\u201d United States v. Fiorelli, 337 F.3d\n282, 288 (3d Cir. 2003). The moving party must show one of the following in order to\nprevail on a Rule 59(e) motion: (1) an intervening change in the controlling law; (2) the\navailability of new evidence that was not available when the court issued its order; or (3)\nthe need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent a manifest injustice. Max's\nSeafood Caf\u00e9 v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. 1999). A motion for\nreconsideration is not appropriate to reargue issues that the court has already\nconsidered and decided. Brambles USA Inc. v. Blocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240 (D.\nDel. 1990).\n\nHaving reviewed Plaintiffs filings as well as the applicable law, the Court\nconcludes that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any of the necessary grounds to\nwarrant a reconsideration of the Court's December 22, 2021 Order. Therefore, all\nmotions pertaining to the motion for reconsideration of the December 22, 2021 Order\nwill be denied. (D.I. 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42)\n\nIn addition, the Court will deny all other motions filed by Plaintiff subsequent to\nthe filing of her notice of appeal. (D.I. 33, 47, 48, 54)\nlll. \u00a9 CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiff's motions. (D.I. 33, 34, 36,\n37, 39, 41, 42, 47, 48, 54)\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\nChief i.\n\nApril 26, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n"}
