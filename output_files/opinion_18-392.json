Civil Action No. 18-392-GBW \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs TissueGen, Inc. (TissueGen) and the Board of Regents, The University of \nTexas System (collectively, \"UT\") allege that Defendant Boston Scientific Corp.'s (\"BSC\") \n\"Synergy\" brand coronary stents (the \"Accused Products\") infringe claims 1, 11, 12, 17, and 26 \n(the \"Asserted Claims\") of U.S. Patent No. 6,596,296 (\"the '296 patent\"). D.I. 124 ,r,r 1-3, 79. \nPending before the Court are BSC's Motion for Summary Judgment of No Willful Infringement \n(D.I. 197) and Motion for Summary Judgment ofNoninfringement (D.I. 198). The Court has \nreviewed BSC's briefing, statements of fact, and response to statements of fact, D.I. 200; D.I. \n201; D.I. 202; D.I. 220; D.I. 221, and UT's briefing, statement of facts, and responses to \nstatements of fact, D.I. 213; D.I. 214; D.I. 216; D.I. 217. The Court will deny both Motions \nbecause there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute between the parties. No hearing is \nnecessary. The Court writes for the benefit of the parties and assumes familiarity with the case. \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"A genuine issue of material fact is one that could lead a reasonable jury to find \nin favor of the nonmoving party.\" Bletz v.

Cir. 2021). \nII. DISCUSSION \nBSC argues that the Court must grant summary judgment of noninfringement because (1) \nthe \"biodegradable polymer coating\" it applies to its stent is not \"thread-like \" or \"filamentous \" \nand lacks \"a common orientation of the polymer molecules \"; (2) the coating's drug and polymer \nare not \"immiscible \"; and (3) the drug-rich and polymer-rich regions of its stent overlap. D.I. \n200 at 11-12. UT disputes each ofBSC's arguments , D.I. 214 at 3, and the parties dispute the \nproper construction of the term \"polymer fiber,\" D.I. 200 at 11; D.I. 214 at 3. BSC further \nargues that the Court must grant summary judgment of no willful infringement because \"[t]he \nrecord does not contain any evidence even remotely meeting\" the \"high standard\" needed to \nshow willful infringement. D.I. 200 at 32. UT argues that its evidence of willful infringement is \n\"sufficient \" to send the issue to a jury. D.I. 214 at 18. The Court finds for UT as to both \nsummary judgment motions. The Court will reschedule trial and hold a separate hearing to \nconstrue the disputed term. \n2 A. Non-Infringement \nThe Court considers each ofBSC's three arguments for summary judgment of non\u00ad\ninfringement in turn. \n1. Whether the Accused Products Contain a \"Fiber\" or \"Polymer Fiber\" \nThe Court finds that, regardless of the claim construction adopted, the parties have a \ngenuine dispute of material fact as to whether the Accused Products contain a \"fiber\" or \n\"polymer fiber.\" \nThe parties' disputes relate to Claim 1 of the '296 patent: \nA composition comprising at least one biodegradable polymer fiber wherein said \nfiber is composed of a first phase and a second phase, the first and second phases \nbeing immiscible, and wherein the second phase comprises one or more \ntherapeutic agents. \nD.I. 1-1 at 27:54-58. On April 15, 2021, the Court construed \"fiber\" to \"have its plain and \nordinary meaning. \" D.I. 90 at 1. The Court explained that the '296 patent uses the term \"fiber\" \n\"according to its plain and ordinary meaning. \" D.I. 90 at 5. \"[I]t seemed like the real dispute,\" \nthe Court explained , \"is not over whether a fiber is threadlike ... but rather whether the term \n'fiber' can encompass what [BSC] says is a coating,\" which, the Court said, \"is an issue of fact \nas to whether a coating that covers some structure can itself be a fiber that must also meet the \nother requirements of the claim fiber.\" D.I. 90 at 5-6. BSC could, the Court explained, reraise \nthe issue at summary judgment if \"that really is a claim construction dispute .... \" D.I. 90 at 6. \nBSC now asks the Court to reconsider its construction of \"fiber\" and to construe the term \n\"polymer fiber.\" D.I. 200 at 13. BSC asserts that a \"polymer fiber\" is \"a thread-like or \nfilamentous polymer structure that at least includes common orientation of the polymer \nmolecules.\" D.I. 200 at 12. Thus, BSC argues, \"[UT's] claims fail as a matter of law because no \nevidence shows that the polymer in the Synergy coating has, for example, a thread-like or \n3 filamentous structure or that the polymer molecules have a common orientation. \" D.I. 200 at 12. \nUT argues that, even if \"the Court adopts [BSC] 's proposed construction of 'polymer fiber,' \nwhich it should not, summary judgment is still unwarranted .\" D.I. 214 at 17. In particular , UT \nargues that its expert, Dr. William G. Pitt, will testify that \"the ultrathin biodegradable polymer \non the serpentine rings of the Synergy stent is a fiber formed by a dynamic process involving \nrotation and shearing.\" D.I. 214 at 17. BSC responds that \"Dr. Pitt's new opinions, disclosed for \nthe first time in opposition to summary judgment , are untimely , extremely prejudicial , and \nshould not be considered. \" D.I. 220 at 8. Further, BSC argues that Pitt's declaration \"confirms \nthat the final coating on the Synergy Stent does not have polymers with a common molecular \norientation, which means [BSC] is entitled to summary judgment .\" D.I. 220 at 9. \nFirst, the Court rejects BSC's argument that Pitt's new declaration is prejudicial. The \nparties' scheduling order recites-under the heading \"Expert Report Supplementation \"-that the \nparties '\"will permit expert declarations to be filed in connection with motions briefing (including \ncase-dispositive motions). \" D.I. 47,r 8(f)(ii) (emphasis in original) . The parties have reset \nscheduling order deadlines multiple times, D.I. 70; D.I. 164; D.I. 179, but they have never \namended the aforesaid provision. Therefore , the Court will consider Pitt's new declaration . \nSecond, a genuine dispute of material fact would remain even if the Court adopted BSC's \nproposed claim construction . BSC asserts the following facts: \n16. A person of ordinary skill would understand \"polymer fiber\" to mean a \nthread-like or filamentous structure made of polymers that have a common \nmolecular orientation. \n17. The amorphous 85: 15 PLGA polymer used to form the Synergy coating has \nrandomly oriented polymer molecule chains and would be unable to \nspontaneously form a fiber without undergoing a spinning and/or extrusion \nprocess to draw or stretch the polymer chains into a common molecular \norientation. \n4 18. Boston Scientific's roll-coating process does not involve spinning and/or \nextrusion to draw or stretch the polymer chains into a common molecular \norientation. \n19. Dr. Pitt did not perform any testing to assess whether the Synergy coating has \nindependent structural integrity or a common molecular orientation of polymer \nmolecules. \nD.I.2021116-19 (citations omitted). UT disputes each asserted fact with reference to Pitt's \nnew declaration. D .I. 217 11 16-19. Pitt explains that BSC' s process to coat the Accused \nProducts \"lead[s] to orientation of the polymer chains\"; \"orients polymer chains\"; \"caus[es] \npolymer chain orientation \"; and \"results in the forming of fiber that meets the other limitations of \nthe claims on the serpentine rings of each stent.\" D.I. 215-4 at PA0980, PA0982. While the \nCourt did not find any reference to a thread-like structure in the relevant section of Pitt's new \ndeclaration , BSC does not challenge the sufficiency of Pitt's declaration on those grounds. See \nD.I. 220 at 8-9. But see D.I. 220 at 9 (arguing that UT's briefing \"fails to offer evidence from \nwhich a jury could find that the coating ... is 'thread-like\"'). \nBSC raises for the first time in its Reply brief that Pitt's declaration supports BSC's \nargument that the final, dry coating on the Synergy stent is not oriented. D.I. 220 at 9.1 \nHowever, Pitt declares that, \"in my opinion, even under [BSC's] misguided construction, BSC's \nroll-coating process results in the forming of fiber that meets the other limitations of the claims \non the serpentine rings of each stent.\" D.I. 215-4 at PA0982. Pitt's discussion ofBSC's process \n1 The Court does not have the benefit ofUT's answer to BSC's argument , and the Federal Circuit \nhas expressed concern about arguments raised for the first time in reply precisely because the \nCourt lacks responsive analysis. See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 439 F.3d 1312, \n1319 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\"Our law is well established that arguments not raised in the opening brief \nare waived.\"); Novosteel SA v. US, Bethlehem Steel Corp., 284 F.3d 1261, 1274 (Fed. Cir. \n2002) (\"[T]he non-moving party ordinarily has no right to respond to the reply brief, at least not \nuntil oral argument . As a matter of litigation fairness and procedure, then, we must treat this \nargument as waived.\"). \n5 to coat the Accused Products shows that his statement has sufficient factual support such that a \nreasonable juror could credit his declaration . BSC' s argument that a different portion of Pitt's \nnew declaration supports its argument goes to the weight that the jury should assign to Pitt's \ntestimony, and not to whether a genuine dispute exists as to a material issue of fact. See BASF \nCorp. v. SNF Holding Co., 955 F.3d 958, 963 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\"[A]t the summary judgment \nstage the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence .... \" (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted)). \nThe jury must be left to decide the parties' factual disputes. Thus, even if the Court were \nto adopt BSC's proposed construction that a \"polymer fiber\" is \"a thread-like or filamentous \npolymer structure that at least includes common orientation of the polymer molecules[,]\" D.I. \n200 at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted), a genuine dispute of material fact remains as to \nwhether BSC's production process would create a common orientation of the polymers. \nThird, UT's definition would not change the result here. BSC argues that its \"coating \ndoes not have a 'large' aspect ratio[,]\" so the Accused Products would not infringe even if \n\"fiber\" were defined \"by a 'large ratio oflength to a characteristic width or thickness' .... \" D.I. \n200 at 20. UT proposed that definition as an alternative to plain and ordinary meaning prior to \nclaim construction. D.I. 80 at 8. UT replies that Pitt properly opines that the Accused Products' \n\"ultrathin biodegradable polymer is a fiber that meets the other limitations of the claims.\" D.I. \n214 at 14. Indeed, Pitt's April 1, 2022 expert report specifies, for various examples of the \nAccused Product, that the length-to-width ratios of the stents are sufficiently large to \"indicat[ e] \na biodegradable polymer fiber format.\" D.I. 215-4 at PA1016--17. Thus, the parties have a \ngenuine dispute of material fact as to whether the aspect ratio of the Accused Products is \n6 sufficiently large to constitute a \"fiber\" or \"polymer fiber.\" BSC does not allege the lack of a \ngenuine dispute of material fact as to a plain and ordinary meaning construction . \nSince the parties have a genuine dispute of material fact regardless of how the Court \nwould construe the term \"fiber\" or \"polymer fiber\" in Claim 1 of the '296 patent, the Court \ndenies the motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on that ground. The Court left \nopen the possibility that BSC could re-raise the construction of the term \"fiber\" at a later point. \nSee D.I. 90 at 6. Since BSC continues to insist that the Court's prior claim construction of plain \nand ordinary meaning was incorrect , the Court will treat BSC's briefing here as a motion for \nclaim construction as to the term \"polymer fiber.\" \nTo prepare the Court to hold a mini-Markman hearing on an accelerated timeframe , the \nparties shall provide joint claim construction briefing to the Court. BSC shall serve, but not file, \nits opening brief, not to exceed 1,000 words, by 12:00 PM on October 12, 2022. UT shall serve, \nbut not file, its answering brief not to exceed 1,500 words, on October 18, 2022. BSC shall \nserve, but not file, its reply brief, not to exceed 1,000 words, on October 21, 2022. UT shall \nserve, but not file its sur-reply brief, not to exceed 500 words, on October 25, 2022. No later \nthan October 26, 2022, the parties shall file a Joint Claim Construction Brief. The parties shall \ncopy and paste their unfiled briefs into one brief, with their positions on each claim term in \nsequential order , in substantiall y the following form: 1. BSC's Opening Position; 2. UT's \nAnswering Position; 3. BSC's Reply Position; 4. UT's Sur-Reply Position. If there are any \nmaterials that would be submitted in an appendix, the parties shall submit them in a joint \nappendix. The parties shall submit two (2) courtesy copies of the joint brief and appendix \nthereto. Further, the Court requests that the parties file each exhibit included in the joint \nappendix in CM/ECF as a separate exhibit, if possible ( e.g., similar to how the exhibits to the \n7 Declaration filed at D.I. 222 were filed). The Court will hold the mini-Markman hearing on \nNovember 7, 2022 at 4:00 PM in place of the scheduled pre-trial conference. If the parties are \navailable for a hearing on November 16 and/or 17, 2022, the parties may submit a new proposed \nbriefing schedule that results in submission of the joint brief no later than November 7, 2022. \n2. Whether the Accused Products' Coating Meets the \"Immiscible\" Limitation \nThe Court finds that the parties have a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the \nAccused Products' coating meets the \"immiscible \" limitation in Claim 1 of the '296 patent. \nClaim 1 of the '296 patent requires that the Accused Product's \"polymer fiber\" be \ncomposed of \"a first phase and a second phase, the first and second phases being immiscible \n.... \" D.I. 1-1 at 27:54-58. On April 15, 2021, the Court announced the parties agreed-upon \nconstructions for \"immiscible \" as \"incapable of dissolving into one another\"; \"first phase\" as \n\"the polymer portion of the fiber\"; and \"second phase\" as \"the discrete drug-containing regions \ndispersed throughout the fiber .... \" D.I. 90 at 1. The polymer in the Accused Products is \n\"poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid ('PLGA')\" and the drug in the Accused Products is \"everolimus. \" \nD.I. 200 at 9; D.I. 214 at 8. The Accused Products are a metal stent with a biodegradable \ncoating; the coating includes both PLGA and everolimus. D.I. 200 at 9, 11; D.I. 214 at 8. \nBSC and UT disagree as to whether BSC's documentation that sought Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) approval of the Accused Products supports \"slight miscibility \" or \nimmiscibility. See D.I. 200 at 22; D.I. 214 at 10. BSC argues that UT misconstrues the issue, \nbecause UT argues that the phases of the polymer fiber are immiscible , but the real question is \nwhether the substances that the phases contain (i.e., PLGA and everolimus) are immiscible. D.I. \n220 at 11. BSC similarly argues that immiscibility must mean something other than having \nseparate phases if the immiscibility limitation is to retain meaning separate from the requirement \nto have \"a frrst phase and a second phase.\" See D.I. 200 at 28-29. However, BSC's prior \n8 briefing focused on phases, not on substances. BSC explained in the joint claim construction \nbrief that (1) a claim lirnitation- \"the first and second phases being immiscible\"-is indefinite \nbecause \"two phases in a solid composition cannot 'dissolve into one another[,] \"' D.I. 80 at 40, \nand (2) the specification of the '296 patent would leave a skilled artisan confused as to whether \nthe \"two phases\" had to be immiscible in a liquid or solid state at various points in the fiber \nproduction process, D.I. 80 at 50. The parties agreed upon their construction of the claim term \n\"immiscible ,\" D.I. 90 at 1, and BSC understood that \"immiscible \" referred to phases (rather than \nsubstances). The Court will not allow BSC to change the object of the miscibility inquiry.2 \nThus, the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact is evident. UT asserts that each \nof the Accused Products contains \"everoliumus-rich domains and D PLGA polymer-rich \ndomains\" that \"are incapable of dissolving into one another .... \" D.I. 213 ,r 3. BSC \"disputes \" \nthat assertion. D.I. 221 ,r 3. Further, the parties dispute the facts underlying their respective \npositions. See, e.g., D.I. 202 ,r 36 (suggesting \"molecular interaction between PLGA and \neverolimus \"); D.I. 217 if 36 (\"[d]isput[ing] \" that factual assertion). Neither party contends \nimmiscibility is immaterial. To the extent BSC contends that the record discredits UT's factual \nassertions , D.I. 220 at 14, the Court finds that a reasonable juror could credit Pitt's reasoned \n2 BSC raises for the first time in its Reply Brief that there is no material dispute of fact as to \nirnmiscibility because \"everolimus \" and \"PLGA\" are synonymous with the phases that contain \nthose substances . D.I. 220 at 12. First, BSC was clear in its opening brief that \"the evidence of \nphase separation, in and of itself, would not permit a reasonable jury to conclude that two \nsubstances are immiscible.\" D.I. 200 at 29 (emphases added). The Court will not credit BSC's \nattempt to equate phases and substances for the first time in its reply brief. See SmithKline \nBeecham , 439 F.3d at 1319. Second, even if the Court credited BSC's new argument, UT \ndisputes as a factual matter that the miscibility of PLGA and everolimus results in the miscibility \nof the phases that contain PLGA and everolimus . See D.I. 217 if 28. Thus, a material fact would \nremain in dispute as to the miscibility of the phases. BSC's arguments to the contrary, see D.I. \n220 at 13 (\"PLGA and everolimus are literally the only substances in the Synergy coating.\") , go \nto the weight that the jury should assign to the parties' evidence. \n9 opinions, see D.I. 215-4 at PA1013-15 (discussing evidence of immiscibility). Therefore, the \nCourt denies the motion for summary judgment of noninfringement as to the immiscibility \nlimitation. \n3. Whether the Regions of the Accused Products' Coating are \"Discrete\" \nThe Court finds that the parties have a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the \nAccused Products contain discrete drug-containing regions within the polymer fiber. According \nto BSC, \"[t]he undisputed facts show that\" (1) the coating of the Accused Products does not \ncontain everolimus that is \"'discrete' from the PLGA polymer\" because ''the PLGA-rich domain \nincludes at least some everolimus .... \" D.I. 200 at 30. Also, they show that (2) \"the PLGA-rich \ndomains ... are not solely made of polymer .... \" D.I. 200 at 31. In response, UT asserts Pitt's \ntestimony that the Accused Products contain discrete \"everolimus-rich domains\" within the \n\"polymer rich domain .... \" See D.I. 214 at 10. \nAt its core, the parties' dispute whether the everolimus and PLGA must be entirely \nseparate from one another in order to satisfy the requirements of Claim 1 of the '296 patent. \nClaim 1 requires \"a first phase and a second phase, the first and second phases being \nimmiscible,\" D.I. 1-1 at 27:54-58, and the parties agreed that \"'first phase' means 'the polymer \nportion of the fiber'\" and that \"'second phase' means 'the discrete drug-containing regions \ndispersed throughout the fiber[.]'\" D.I. 90 at 1. The parties agreed that the \"discrete\" regions \nmust be \"drug-containing ,\" not that such regions must include only the drug. One definition of \n\"contain\" is \"to consist of wholly or in part\" and another is \"to have capacity for [or] be able to \nhold .... \" Contain, Merriam Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (Accessed Sept. 29, 2022), \nhttps://unabridged.merriam-webster .com/unabridged/contain. The '296 patent uses contain in \nthis manner. For example, Claim 21 of the '296 patent claims a fiber comprised of polymer \nlayers that \"optionally contain one or more therapeutic agents.\" D.I. 1-1 at 28:63-67. Claim 23 \n10 is \"the composition of Claim 1, wherein the fiber contains more than one therapeutic agent .... \" \nD.I. 1-1 at 29:4-5. Neither the polymer layers of Claim 21 nor the fiber of Claim 23 could be \nentirely comprised of the therapeutic agents, even though the therapeutic agents are \"contained\" \ntherein. Thus, the parties did not agree upon a purity requirement. \nUT asserts that the Accused Products have \"everolimus-rich domains and the PLGA \npolymer-rich domains[,]\" D.I. 213, 3, and Pitt will provide testimony that supports UT's \nassertion, see, e.g., D.I. 215-4 at PA1010 (\"Figure 2.A.F5 illustrates the phase separated \nmorphology of the SYNERGY coating, with discrete everolimus-rich domains dispersed \nthroughout the PLGA polymer matrix.\"). Thus, a reasonable juror could find that the Accused \nProducts have \"a first phase and a second phase,\" D.I. 1-1 at 27:54-58 , where '\"first phase' \nmeans 'the polymer portion of the fiber\"' and \"'second phase' means 'the discrete drug-\ncontaining regions dispersed throughout the fiber[.]\"' D.I. 90 at 1. Therefore, the Court must \ndeny BSC's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement as to the discrete regions \nlimitation of Claim 1. \nSince there remain genuine disputes of material fact as to noninfringement, the Court will \ndeny BSC's Motion for Summary Judgment ofNoninfringement. \nB. Willfulness \nThe Court finds that the parties have genuine disputes of material fact as to willfulness. \n\"The subjective willfulness of a patent infringer, intentional or knowing, may warrant \nenhanced damages .... \" Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 579 U.S. 93, 105 (2016). \n\"Knowledge of the patent alleged to be willfully infringed continues to be a prerequisite to \nenhanced damages.\" WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co., 829 F.3d 1317, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nHowever, \"pre-suit knowledge alone is not sufficient to support a finding of willful \ninfringement. \" Intel/. Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp., 234 F. Supp. 3d 601, 612 (D. Del. \n11 2017), aff'd, 725 F. App'x 976 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \"The sort of conduct warranting enhanced \ndamages has been variously described in our cases as willful, wanton, malicious , bad-faith , \ndeliberate, consciously wrongful , flagrant, or-indeed-characteristic of a pirate.\" Halo Elecs., \n579 U.S. at 103-04. However , \"the concept of willfulness requires a jury to find no more than \ndeliberate or intentional infringement. \" SRI Int'/, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 14 F.4th 1323, 1330 \n(Fed. Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court is mindful that \nwillfulness is often a jury issue. See Exmark Mfg. Co. Inc. v. Briggs & Stratton Power Prod. \nGrp., LLC, 879 F.3d 1332, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nAccording to BSC, UT cannot show that BSC had knowledge of the '296 patent prior to \nthis suit, nor can UT show \"that [BSC] took any action based on purported knowledge of the \n'296 patent, such as copying, reverse engineering , or the like.\" D.I. 200 at 33, 37. Further, UT \n\"also fail[s] to show ... willfulness \" after this suit was filed in November 2017. D.I. 1; D.I. 200 \nat 39. In response, UT asserts six pieces of evidence that it says show willful infringement. D.I. \n214 at 18-24. \nFirst, Mary Beth Moynihan-now the chief marketing officer of BSC-testified that \nshe-then the vice president of business development at BSC-and Kevin Ballinger-then the \nvice president of research and development at BSC-met with Dr. Kevin Nelson-the chief \nscientific officer of TissueGen -at an industry conference about TissueGen 's technology. D.I. \n215-1 at PA0004-07. Moynihan testified that she requested from Nelson and received follow-up \ninformation on April 24, 2009, and Moynihan testified that she \"sometimes\" opens attachments \nsent to her. D.I. 215-1 at PA0006-0009 , PA0013. \nSecond, Nelson received an email from Moynihan on May 26, 2009 that said Moynihan \nand Ballinger \"ha[d] reviewed your material\" and that BSC would not invest in TissueGen; the \n12 \"material\" consisted of an \"executive summary and PowerPoint presentation .... \" D.I. 215-4 at \nPAl 153. Third, the PowerPoint presentation specified that TissueGen was developing a \n\"peripheral vascular stent\" rather than a \"[ c ]oronary drug eluting stent[]\"; asserted a\"[ s ]olid \n[p]atent [f]oundation \" based on four patents, one of which was the '296 patent that was \n\"[ e ]xclusive[ly] license[ d] to TissueGen \"; explained that the stent contained a \"biodegradable \npolymer\" and a coil with \"[f]ully [t]unable [ d]rug [ d]elivery\"; and pointed to \"future product[] \" \nopportunities. D.I. 215-1 at PA000l 7-18, PA0020-22, PA0029-30 , PA0036. \nFourth, Dr. Yen Lane Chen testified that BSC began the project that resulted in the \n\"Synergy Stent\" in 2006; that BSC first used the \"Synergy Stent\" in humans in 2009 and did so \nin the United States in 2012; that all \"Synergy Stents\" sold by BSC from 2015 through2020 had \nthe same \"coating formulation \"; that the coating has a \"drug rich domain ... dispersed in the \npolymer rich domain\"; and that BSC \"realize[d] \" the existence of the drug-rich and polymer-rich \ndomains in 2008 or 2009. D.I. 215-1 at PA0090-91 , PA0095-96 , PA0098, PA0l0l-02. As \nexplained above, Claim 1 of the '296 patent requires that the Accused Product have two phases, \nD.I. 1-1 at 27:54--58, one of which is a \"polymer portion of the fiber\" and the other of which is \n\"discrete drug-containing regions dispersed throughout the fiber[,]\" D.I. 90 at 1. \nFifth, Pitt declares (i) that, based on his review of one patent that a BSC scientist \nobtained, \"individuals at BSC recognized they could cover, the ablurninal surfaces of serpentine \nrings of a bare metal stent with fibers\" in 2006 and (ii) that another BSC patent publication\u00ad\nfiled in 2007--describes a fiber \"not dissimilar from the fiber that BSC has disposed on the \nabluminal surface of the stent in the SYNERGY family of products.\" D.I. 215-4 at PA0986--87 . \nFurther, Pitt asserts in his expert report that, \"[i]n my opinion, the concepts explained in the \n[presentation that Nelson provided to Moynihan] are indistinguishable from the concepts set \n13 forth the SYNERGY Developer's video .... \" D.I. 215-4 at PA1023. Sixth, UT points to BSC's \nfailure to secure an opinion of counsel regarding potential infringement or invalidity of the '296 \npatent and failure to bring any challenge to the patent. D.I. 214 at 23. \nUnsurprisingly , UT's evidence did little to sway BSC. As to UT's allegation of pre-suit \nwillfulness , BSC argues that UT cannot show BSC's knowledge ofUT's technology , since the \npresentation relates to a peripheral-not a coronary-stent and because Moynihan does not \"say \nthat she actually read the patent.\" D.I. 220 at 17-18. Further, BSC asserts that UT offers no \nevidence that could connect Moynihan 's \"purported knowledge to either (1) any appreciation of \ninfringement or (2) any actions taken by [BSC].\" D.I. 220 at 18. Finally, BSC argues that \"none \nof these activities have anything to do with actions by someone at [BSC] who knew of the '296 \npatent and knew of an infringement risk.\" D .I. 220 at 19. \nThe Court finds that a rational juror could credit UT's evidence, discredit BSC's \nevidence, and conclude that UT both knew of BSC's technology and intentionally persisted in its \nuse prior to this lawsuit. See Archer DX, LLC v. QIAGEN Sciences, LLC, 2022 WL 4597877, at \n*9 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2022) (\"The jury was entitled to assess credibility and infer willfulness \nfrom the evidence presented .... \"). A rational juror could find that Moynihan and Ballinger \nopened and read Nelson's PowerPoint presentation based on Moynihan 's statement that she and \nBallinger \"reviewed [Nelson's] material.\" D.I. 215-4 at PAI 153. A rational juror also could \nfind that the PowerPoint presentation 's discussion of a stent that contained a \"biodegradable \npolymer\" with \"[f]ully [t]unable [d]rug [d]elivery\" and that mentioned by name the '296 patent \nwas sufficient to put a reviewer on notice of the patented technology . D.I. 215-1 at PA000l 7, \nPA0020, PA0029-30 . Next, a rational juror could credit Pitt 's report that the concepts Nelson \npresented to Moynihan and Ballinger were \"indistinguishable \" from those in the Accused \n14 Products. D.I. 215-4 at PA1023. Additionall y, a rational juror could credit Pitt's and Chen's \ncombined testimony to conclude that BSC was using this \"indistinguishable \" technology that met \nlimitations specified in the '296 patent as early as 2006. See D.I. 215-1 at PA0091, PA0lOl-0 2; \nD.I. 215-4 at PA0986-87. Finally, since executives at BSC knew of the patented technology and \nsince the patented technology was similar to the technology BSC was developing , testing, \nmarketing, and ( eventually) selling, a rational juror could infer that BSC acted despite the \nknowledge that it infringed. See Extang Corp. v. Truck Accessories Grp., LLC, 2022 WL \n607868, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 18, 2022) (finding that \"the alleged many similarities between the \nparties' products\" supported denial of summary judgment of no willfulness). BSC tellingly \nargues that, \"given the remarkable differences between the peripheral, fully biodegradable stent \ntechnology in the presentation sent to Ms. Moynihan and the coronary , metal Synergy stent, no \nrational juror could [conclude] that Ms. Moynihan or anyone else would have appreciated any \ninfringement risk and taken action with that knowledge .\" D .I. 220 at 19 ( citations omitted). \nHowever, whether such differences were \"substantial \" is a fact question for the jury, not for the \nCourt, to resolve. \nAs to post-suit willfulness , BSC argues that \"[UT] cannot demonstrate any post-suit \nconduct that goes beyond typical alleged infringement . ... \" D.I. 220 at 20. As an initial matter, \n\"willfulness requires a jury to find no more than deliberate or intentional infringement.\" SRI \nInt'/, 14 F.4th at 1330 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). There is no dispute that, \nonce the lawsuit was filed, BSC knew of the '296 patent. See D.I. 1126 (accusing BSC of \ninfringement). The question for the Court is whether UT has proffered sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate intentional or deliberate infringement. While BSC has consistently denied that it \ninfringed the '296 patent, see D.I. 1 1126-28; D.I. 401126-28 , UT has proffered expert \n15 testimony that the Accused Products and the '296 patent are quite similar, see D.I. 215-4 at \nPA1023, and can point to Chen's testimony to show that BSC recognized many of the elements \nof the patented technology that were present in the Accused Products , see D.I. 215-1 at PA0091, \nPA0lOl-02 . Based on this evidence , \"a rational juror could find BSC knew of the '296 patent \n... and knew it was coating stents with fibers that infringed the '296 patent claims\" and \ncontinued to do so anyway. D .I. 214 at 23. 3 \nIn summary , UT has advanced evidence sufficient for a rational juror to conclude that \nboth before and after this suit was filed, BSC knew about and intentionally infringed the \ntechnology in the '296 patent. The Court is skeptical that UT has promulgated evidence \nsufficient to support enhanced damages , but \"the concept of willfulness requires a jury to find no \nmore than deliberate or intentional infringement. \" SRI Int'!, 14 F.4th at 1330 (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); see id (\"Although willfulness is a component of enhancement , 'an \naward of enhanced damages does not necessaril y flow from a willfulness finding.'\" ( citation \nomitted)). \nTherefore , the Court denies BSC's motion for summary judgment of no willfulness. No \nlater than October 21, 2022, the parties shall meet and confer to determine whether to bifurcate \ninfringement and invalidity from damages and willfulness and try this case in two phases to a \n3 UT's evidence of post-suit willfulness is limited. For example, the Court agrees with BSC, D.I. \n220 at 20, that the failure to get an opinion of counsel is not evidence of willful infringement. \nSee 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 298 (\"The failure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel with respect to \nany allegedly infringed patent ... may not be used to prove that the accused infringer willfully \ninfringed the patent .... \"). Further, BSC was (and is) under no obligation to challenge the '296 \npatent's validity, since BSC may (and, based on its assertions before this Court, does) believe \nthat it has not infringed . Finally, UT failed to distinguish between its evidence in support of pre\u00ad\nsuit and post-suit willfulness; while UT's evidence appeared directed primarily at pre-suit \nconduct, see, e.g., D.I. 214 at 23 (\"BSC knew of the '296 patent since 2009 .... \"), BSC does not \nargue for waiver, D.I. 220 at 20, and the Court need not rule on that issue. \n16 single jury. The Court recognizes the potential value of bifurcation where, as here, the issue of \nwillfulness is close at summary judgment. The Court instructs the parties to consider what \nevidence may be limited to a willfulness /damages phase. After the parties meet and confer, \neither party may file-no later than October 31, 2022 and consistent with Local Rule 7.1.2-a \nmotion to bifurcate that describes what evidence should be limited to a willfulness/damages \nphase. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nThe Court finds that the parties have genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the \nAccused Products contain a fiber, two immiscible phases, and a discrete drug-containing region. \nThe Court also finds that the parties have a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether BSC's \ninfringement, if it occurred, was willful. Therefore , the Court denies both of BSC's motions for \nsummary judgment . \nWHEREFORE , at Wilmington this 6th day of October, 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat: \n1. BSC's Motion for Summary Judgment ofNoninfringement (D.I. 198) is DENIED ; \n2. BSC's Motion for Summary Judgment ofNo Willful Infringement (D.I. 197) is \nDENIED ; \n3. Trial in this case is rescheduled for the 25th, 26th, 27th, 30th, and 31st of January, 2023, \nand the pre-trial conference is rescheduled for January 12, 2023, at 3:00 PM; \n4. The parties shall appear on November 7, 2022 at 4:00 PM for a claim construction \nhearing as to the term \"polymer fiber.\" Each party is allocated up to thirty (30) \nminutes for its arguments; \n17 5. The parties shall submit a joint claim construction brief in the form and based on the \nschedule discussed herein; and \n6. The parties shall meet and confer no later than October 21, 2022 on the issue of \nwhether to bifurcate the trial and may file a motion to bifurcate no later than October \n31, 2022. \n18 GREGORYB.
