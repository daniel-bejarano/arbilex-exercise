Connolly", "date": "04-03-2023", "ocr_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDARTON ARCHERY, LLC,\nPlaintiff,\n\nv. C.A. 23-140-CFC\nBOWTECH, LLC f/k/a BOWTECH, INC.,\nBOWTECH GP, LLC, EXCALIBUR\nCROSSBOW, LLC, EXCALIBUR\nCROSSBOW US, LLC, EXCALIBUR\nCROSSBOW HOLDINGS, LLC, and\nEXCALIBUR CROSSBOW INVESTORS,\nLLC,\n\nNe Ne Ne ee ee fe te we eS ea aS SS we\n\nDefendnats.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nPending before me is Defendants\u2019 Unopposed Motion to Seal Exhibit 1 to\nDefendants\u2019 Corporate Disclosure Statement (D.I. 17). Defendants want to\nmaintain under seal the ownership and citizenship of JDH Capital I, LP, a\nDelaware limited partnership that is the sole member of Bowhunter Acquisition,\nLLC, which is the sole member of Defendant Bowtech, LLC, which is the sole\nmember of Defendant Excalibur Crossbow, LLC and Defendant Excalibur\nCrossbow US, LLC.\n\nThe District Court is not a star chamber. We are a public institution in a\n\ndemocratic republic and the public has a right of access to our filings and\nproceedings. That right is founded in the common law and \u201cantedates the\nConstitution.\u201d Bank of Am. Nat'l Tr. & Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Hotel Rittenhouse Assocs.,\n800 F.2d 339, 343 (3d Cir. 1986). The public\u2019s right of access is not absolute; but\nit is strongly presumed, and it can be overcome only if a party demonstrates that\npublic disclosure of a filing will result in \u201ca clearly defined and serious injury,\u201d Jn\nre Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662,672 (3d Cir.\n2019).\n\nDefendants state that \u201c[d]etails pertaining to the specific ownership of JDH\nCapital I, LP, are not publicly available and disclosure of such confidential\nmaterial risks substantial harm to JDH Capital I, LP\u2019s business interests.\u201d D.I. 17\nat 1. Defendants do not say how JDH Capital I, LP\u2019s business interests could\nsuffer harm by the public disclosure of the identity and citizenship of its owners.\nIn any event, the public disclosure that an individual has an ownership interest in\nan entity created by a state cannot be said to constitute a clearly defined and\nserious injury. Corporations and limited partnerships may offer individuals\nprotection from liability, but they do not entitle individuals to anonymity in court\nproceedings.\n\nNow therefore, at Wilmington on this Third day of April in 2023,\n\nDefendants\u2019 Unopposed Motion to Seal Exhibit 1 to Defendants\u2019 Corporate\nDisclosure Statement (D.I. 17) is DENIED.\n\nGh CH\nChief Judge\n"}
