D.I. 1 at 1, 3. Pending before me is Wilmington's motion to dismiss \nthe Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 6) (D .I. 15). \nI. BACKGROUND \nBecause I am considering the merits of a motion to dismiss, the following \nfacts and background information , except where noted otherwise, are taken from \nthe Complaint and from documents explicitly relied upon in the Complaint and are \nassumed to be true. See Mgmt. Sci. Assocs. v. Datavant , Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 238, \n244 (D. Del. 2020). \nA. Wilmington's Towing and lmpoundment Policies \nWilmington imposes monetary fines against car owners for parking \nviolations. D.I. 1 ,r 14. Section 37-125(a) of the City's Code authorizes the City to \ntow and impound a car parked on a City street if the car's owner has $200 or more \nin unpaid parking tickets. WILMINGTON, DEL., CITY CODE\u00a7 37-125(a) (1993); D.I. 1 ,r 15. Unpaid tickets do not count towards the $200 threshold \"until.the \ndesignated appeal window has passed.\" WILMINGTON, DEL., CITY CODE\u00a7 37-\n125(a) (1993). Under section 37-131 of the Code, once a car has been towed and \nimpounded, the car's owner cannot obtain it from the impoundment lot unless and \nuntil she has paid the City all her outstanding parking fines and towing and storage \nfees, regardless of whether the appeal window has run for those fines. Id.\u00a7 37-\n131. The Code permits the owner to make the payment of any fine \"under \nprotest,\" in which case the payment is held in escrow by the City's finance \ndepartment pending the outcome of a hearing before the City's municipal court. \nId.\u00a7 37-131(b). Under the Code, \"[i]fthe municipal court determines that ... such \nfines and fees or any part thereof need not have been paid, the court shall so advise \nthe department of finance which shall release such fines or fees or part thereof \nfrom the escrow account to the motor vehicle owner or his agent.\" Id. \nEach year, Wilmington contracts with a private company to tow and \nimpound motor vehicles. The City's Charter requires that its contracts be \ncompetitively bid and awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. WILMINGTON, \nDEL., CHARTER\u00a7 8-200(1) (1993). To that end, Wilmington solicits each year bids \nin the form of the towing and storage fees a company will charge the owners of the \ncars it tows and impounds. D.I. 1 ,r 25. The City Code prohibits the company that \nwins the towing and impoundment contract from charging a car owner towing and \n2 storage fees that exceed the contracted fee amounts. WILMINGTON, DEL., CITY \nCODE\u00a7 37-13l(a)(3) (1993). \nIn 2018, First State Towing won the City's contract when it bid, and \nWilmington accepted, a towing fee of $0 and a daily storage fee of $10. D.I. 1 \n,I 27. In 2019 and 2020, City Towing won the contract when it bid, and \nWilmington accepted, $0 for both the towing and storage fees. D.I. 1 ,r,r 28-29. \nYou might wonder, given these fee amounts, how First State and City \nTowing could have made any money under their contracts. The answer, according \nto the Complaint, is that Wilmington \"contractually empowered the ... towing \ncompanies to keep and scrap people's cars\" that were impounded for more than 30 \ndays, D.I. 1 ,r 2, 22, and \"to retain all proceeds\" obtained from the scrapping of \nthose vehicles, D.I. 1 ,r 22-23. In the words of the Complaint, \"[b]y structuring its \ncontract in this way, and then accepting zero-dollar ($0) bids, ... Wilmington \ncreated an obvious incentive problem: the only way for its private contractors to \nmake money was to sell, scrap, keep, or otherwise dispose of the cars that they had \ntowed.\" D.I. 1 ,r 30. And, according to the Complaint, \"[t]hat is exactly what \nhappened,\" and \"in 2020 alone, ... City Towing sold, scrap[p ]ed, kept, or \notherwise disposed of at least 987 out of the 2,551 cars it towed.\" D.I. 1 ,r 32. The \nComplaint further alleges that no proceeds obtained from the scrapping of cars by \nFirst State or City Towing were credited against the car owners' alleged parking \n3 debts, D.I. 1 ,I 41, and that no \"surplus value\"-i.e., the amount of the scrapping \nvalue of a car above and beyond the alleged parking debt of its owner-was ever \nreturned to car owners, D.I. 1 ,I 42. \nB. Plaintiff Shaheed \nAccording to the Complaint, over a period of nine days in September 2019, \nShaheed's 2005 Hyundai XG350 was legally parked in Wilmington but was \nnonetheless issued six parking tickets. D.I. 1 ,r,r 3, 46-49, 64, 72. Shaheed alleges \nthat she \"timely appealed her tickets fplural],\" D.I. 1 ,I 49, and that \"while her \nappeal [singular] was pending,\" the City caused First State to tow and impound her \ncar, D.I. 11150-51. Shaheed does not identify the appeal that was pending when \nher car was towed. \nShaheed alleges that Wilmington and First State refused to release her car \nfrom impoundment unless and until she paid the City $320. D.I. 1 11 3, 63-64. \nShe says she was unable to pay that amount and, as a result, her car remained \nimpounded for more than 30 days and was ultimately scrapped by First State. D.I. \n1 ,I,I 66-67. Although the retail value of Shaheed's car was $4,250 (or $3,930 \nmore than $320), the City never extinguished Shaheed's fines. D.I. 1 ,r,i 73-75. \nNor did Wilmington or First State return to Shaheed any of the surplus value. D.I. \n1 ,I 77. On the contrary, Wilmington maintains that Shaheed still owes it for \npayment of the parking tickets, and Wilmington has \"added additional penalties\" to \n4 Shaheed' s ticket debt and \"authorized debt collection action\" for those penalties \nagainst Shaheed. D .I. 1 ,r,r 7 8-79. \nThe alleged $3 20 fine amount is a bit of a mystery. The initial fine for each \nticket was $40, see, e.g., D.I. 17-3 at 205; and the City told Shaheed in letters sent \nto her home for each ticket that if she failed to pay or appeal a ticket within 21 \ndays of its issuance, a $20 penalty would be added to the fine amount, see, e.g., \nD.I. 17-3 at 205. Thus, you would expect the total fine for each unpaid ticket to be \n$60, which is not a factor of $320. \nIn those same letters, the City explained how Shaheed could file an appeal \nwith the City's Office of Civil Appeals and that, if an appeal were denied, she \ncould appeal the denial to the State's Justice of the Peace Court. See, e.g., D.I. 17-\n3 at 205-06. The letters also expressly stated that \"[i]f [Shaheed] ha[ d] more than \nfive or more outstanding tickets and/or owe[d] $200 or more due to outstanding \ntickets, [her] vehicle [wa]s also subject to being towed or booted without further \nnotice or warning.\" D.I. 17-3 at 205-06. \nWilmington states in its briefing that it towed Shaheed' s car for \"past due \nfines and penalties [that] were related to parking tickets Shaheed did not appeal \nand failed to pay.\" D.I. 16 at 5 (emphasis in the original). It cites in support of this \nstatement an Immobilization and Tow record that appears to show that a boot was \nplaced on Shaheed's car on October 25, 2019 and that the boot was removed and \n5 the car was towed on October 30, 2019. D.I. 16 at 5; D.I. 17-4 at 239. The \nImmobilization and Tow record, which was not referenced in the Complaint, also \nappears to show that as of October 30, 2019 Shaheed owed Wilmington a total of \n$340 (not $320), which consisted of three $80 fines for three parking tickets \n(totaling $240) and a $100 \"boot fee.\" D.I. 17-4 at 239-40. Although it is \nundisputed that Shaheed did not appeal these three parking tickets, nothing in the \nComplaint, the documents referenced in the Complaint, or the Immobilization and \nTow record explains why the fine amounts were $80. \nWilmington argues, and Shaheed does not dispute, that Shaheed timely \nappealed only three of her six tickets to the City's Office of Civil Appeals. See \nD.I. 16 at 4; D.I. 17-3 at 210,214; D.I. 29. The Office of Civil Appeals denied two \nof the appeals on September 27, 2019 and the third appeal on October 10, 2019. \nD.I. 17-3 at 217,219. Shaheed appealed the first two denials to the Justice of the \nPeace Court, which denied those appeals on January 17, 2020. See D.I. 17-3 at \n222-27; D.I. 17-4 at 231-37. The Complaint alleges that Shaheed's car was towed \non October 30, 2019 (i.e., while the two appeals in the Justice of the Peace Court \nwere pending). D.I. 1 ,r 51. \nC. Plaintiff Dickerson \nThe Complaint alleges that Dickerson's 2002 Dodge Ram Van was issued a \nparking ticket in April 2021 that \"indicated that the car needed to be moved within \n6 seven days or it would be towed.\" D.I. 1 ,r 88. Dickerson alleges that he was \ndealing with the death of a grandchild at the time and that he therefore failed to \nmove the car. D.I. 1 ,r 89. On April 19, 2021, at Wilmington's direction, City \nTowing towed and impounded Dickerson's car. D.I. 1 ,r,r 90-91. According to \nDickerson, although he paid the $60 parking ticket and a $25 \"release fee,\" City \nTowing refused to return his car to him until he paid an additional $910 for \n\"storage fees.\" D.I. 1 ,r,r 94, 97-101. Dickerson was unable to afford that amount, \nand consequently, City Towing scrapped his car after 30 days. D.I. 1 ,r,r 104-06. \nAlthough the retail value of the car was between $2,750 and $4,834, neither \nWilmington nor City Towing ever returned any surplus value to Dickerson. D.I. 1 \n,r 111-12. The Complaint further alleges that \"Defendants failed to \nprovide ... Dickerson with a post-deprivation hearing that would have allowed \nhim to try to reclaim his car without paying the $910 demand.\" D .I. 1 ,r 107. \nD. Plaintiffs' Claims \nThe Complaint originally had six counts, but Plaintiffs stated in a letter filed \nafter oral argument on the pending motion that they would voluntarily dismiss \nCounts II and III, see D.I. 42, and I will accordingly dismiss those counts. \nAll the remaining counts are brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983. In Count I of the \nComplaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' towing, impoundment, and scrapping \nof their cars violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the \n7 City under the Fourteenth Amendment. D.I. 1 at 17-18. In Count IV, Shaheed \nalleges that Defendants' seizure of her car without any notice or a hearing violated \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. D.I. 1 at 22-24. In Count \nV, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants scrapped their cars without a \"post\u00ad\ndeprivation\" hearing in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. D.I. 1 at 24-27. And in Count VI, they allege that the scrapping of \ntheir cars to pay for their alleged parking violations constitutes an excessive fine in \nviolation of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the City under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. D.I. 1 at 27-29. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS FOR MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. Rule 12(b )( 6) \n\"A district court may grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted under Rule l 2{b )( 6) if, accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Ballentine v. United States, 486 \nF .3d 806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To \nstate a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. \nCIV. P. 8(a)(2). Detailed factual allegations are not required, but the complaint \nmust include more than mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of \n8 the elements of a cause of action.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 \n(2007) ( citation omitted). The complaint must set forth enough facts, accepted as \ntrue, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Id. at 570. A claim is \nfacially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ( citation omitted). Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible is a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. at 679 ( citation \nomitted). \nB. Section 1983 \nSection 1983 provides in relevant part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, \nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or \nthe District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be \nsubjected, any citizen of the United States or other person \nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured \nin an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper \nproceeding for redress. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \"[M]unicipalities and other local government units \n[are] ... persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies.\" Monell v. Dep 't of Soc. Servs. of N. Y., \n436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978). Under Monell, \"[a] municipality is liable under\u00a7 1983 \nwhen a plaintiff can demonstrate that the municipality itself, through the \n9 implementation of a municipal policy or custom, causes a constitutional violation.\" \nColburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 1027 (3d Cir. 1991) (citing Monell, \n436 U.S. at 691-95). Thus, a municipality may be sued directly if it is alleged to \nhave violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights through \"a policy statement, \nordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that \n[municipality's] officers.\" Monell, 436 U.S. at 690. In addition, a municipality \nmay be sued under\u00a7 1983 \"for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to \ngovernmental 'custom' even though such a custom has not received formal \napproval through the body's official decisionmaking channels.\" Id. at 690-91. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. The City's Arguments with Respect to All Claims \nWilmington argues that all claims should be dismissed because the \nComplaint \"fails to plausibly show an unconstitutional custom.\" D.I. 16 at 10. In \nthe City's words: \"two incidents do not constitute a pattern sufficient to show \ncustom or practice.\" D.I. 16 at 10. This argument fails for two reasons. First, \nunder Monell a municipality faces liability under \u00a7 1983 for an \"unconstitutional \npolicy or custom,\" Colburn, 946 F.2d at 1027 (emphasis added); and the \nComplaint alleges that Wilmington's towing ordinances and contracts constituted \nan unconstitutional policy, D.I. 11148. Second, to the extent the Complaint \nalleges an unconstitutional custom, that alleged custom is not predicated solely on \n10 two incidents. The Complaint alleges that in 2020 Wilmington allowed City \nTowing to sell, scrap, or otherwise dispose of987 of the 2,551 vehicles it towed \nthat year. D.I. 1 ,r 32. \nWilmington next argues that \nto the extent Plaintiffs premise municipal liability on the \nactions of its independent contractors, it is well-settled \nthat the City cannot be held liable for constitutional \nviolations under a theory of respondeat superior. An \nemployee's deviation from official policy cannot \nestablish the requisite causal link between the alleged \nharm and the municipality. Nor do municipalities have a \nduty to supervise independent contractors. \nD.I. 16 at 10 (citations omitted). But the Complaint alleges that Wilmington's \npolicies and customs as implemented by City Towing and First State at the City's \ndirection created an unconstitutional system, not that City Towing and First State \ndeviated from those policies or customs when they towed and impounded \nPlaintiffs' and others' cars. And the law is clear that \"[p]rivate persons, jointly \nengaged with state officials in [a] prohibited action,\" act under color of state law. \nUnited States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794 (1966). \nB. Plaintiffs' Due Process Claims \nShaheed alleges in Count IV of the Complaint that Defendants seized her car \nwithout first providing notice and a hearing in violation of her due process rights. \nD.I. 1 ,r,r 178-80. Both Shaheed and Dickerson allege in Count V that Defendants' \nimpoundment and scrapping of their vehicles violated their due process rights \n11 because the City refused to provide them a post-seizure hearing unless and until \nthey paid their outstanding parking fines under protest. D.I. 1 ,r,r 196-98. \n\"To state a claim under \u00a7 1983 for deprivation of procedural due process \nrights, a plaintiff must allege that (1) he was deprived of an individual interest that \nis encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of 'life, liberty, or \nproperty,' and (2) the procedures available to him did not provide 'due process of \nlaw.\"' Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225, 233-34 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting \nAlvin v. Suzuki, 227 F.3d 107, 116 (3d Cir. 2000)). \n\"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \nat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\" Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n319,333 (1976) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In most cases, the \nopportunity to be heard should come before the government deprives an individual \nof his property. But \"the necessity of quick action by the [government] or the \nimpracticality of providing any meaningful pre[-]deprivation process, when \ncoupled with the availability of some meaningful means by which to assess the \npropriety of the [government's] action at some time after the initial taking, can \nsatisfy the requirements of procedural due process.\" Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. \n527, 539 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 \n(1986). \n12 The Court in Mathews identified three factors that courts should consider \nwhen determining whether an individual has received the process she is due under \nthe Constitution: \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the \nofficial action; second, the risk of an erroneous \ndeprivation of such interest through the procedures used, \nand the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute \nprocedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's \ninterest, including the function involved and the fiscal \nand administrative burdens that the additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail. \n424 U.S. at 335. \n1. Shaheed's Pre-Seizure Due Process Claim \nWilmington argues that Shaheed' s pre-seizure due process claim should be \ndismissed for two reasons: (1) Shaheed was notified of and declined an opportunity \nto appeal the ticket fines for which her car was towed; and (2) due process does not \nrequire a city to provide a car owner with a hearing before towing the owner's car \nfrom the city's streets. D.I. 16 at 12-14. \nThis first argument fails at this stage of the proceedings because it requires \nresolution of disputed ( and, frankly, confusing) factual allegations. The Complaint \nalleges that Shaheed' s car was ticketed six times and that she \"timely appealed her \ntickets,\" D.I. 1 ,I 49, intimating that she appealed all six tickets. But the Complaint \nalso alleges that Shaheed's car was towed \"while her appeaI\"-i.e., one appeal\u00ad\nwas pending. D.I. 1 ,I 50. Wilmington counters-and Shaheed does not dispute-\n13 that Shaheed appealed only three of her six tickets. D.I. 16 at 4; D.I. 29. \nWilmington also insists that Shaheed' s car was towed for fines related to the three \ntickets it says she did not appeal. D.I. 16 at 5. In support of this assertion, \nWilmington points to the Immobilization and Tow record, even though that record \nwas not referenced in the Complaint. Putting aside whether I might properly \nconsider the Immobilization and Tow record to resolve a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the \nrecord appears to show that at the time her car was towed, Shaheed had three \ntickets, each with fine amounts of$80. D.I. 17-4 at 239-40. Although the sum of \nthose fine amounts ($240) exceeds the $200 towing threshold, nothing in the \nrecord explains how a ticket's fine could be $80, let alone how or why Shaheed \nwould have known that the fine for each of the three tickets in question was $80. \nOn the contrary, Wilmington's notice letters to Shaheed expressly stated that \nfailure to pay a fine within 21 days increases the initial $40 fine amount to $60, \nD.I. 17-3 at 205, and the sum of three $60 fines ($180) would not exceed the $200 \ntowing threshold. Given these questionable and contested factual allegations, I \ncannot accept Wilmington's factual assertion that Shaheed declined to appeal the \nticket fines for which her car was towed. \nI agree with Wilmington, however, that Shaheed's pre-seizure due process \nclaim fails as a matter of law. Where, as here, a city provides an adequate post\u00ad\ndeprivation remedy, due process does not require the city to provide a car owner \n14 with a hearing before it tows the owner's car from its streets. See Sutton v. City of \nMilwaukee, 672 F.2d 644, 646 (7th Cir. 1982) (\"[l]t is not a violation of the due \nprocess clause to tow an illegally parked car without first giving the owner notice \nand an opportunity to be heard with respect to the lawfulness of the tow.\"); see \nalso Abernathy v. City of Pittsburgh, 795 F. App'x 85, 87 (3d Cir. 2020) (holding \nthat a pre-deprivation hearing before towing plaintiffs car was not required where \nplaintiff was provided an adequate post-deprivation remedy under Pennsylvania \nlaw). \nThe Mathews factors, considered in their totality, support this conclusion. \nFirst, though not insignificant, the property interest affected by towing the car from \nthe street is not the car itself but the use of the car until the conclusion of a post\u00ad\ndeprivation hearing. Shaheed argues that the post-deprivation hearing afforded by \nWilmington is itself unconstitutional and therefore inadequate, but I reject that \nargument for the reasons discussed below, see infra Section 111.B.2. \nSecond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation and the probable value of \nadditional safeguards to protect against an erroneous deprivation are small. As the \nCourt in Sutton noted: \nThe determination that a car is illegally parked is pretty \ncut and dried. Police officers make mistakes, of course, \nbut in giving out parking tickets not very many-far \nfewer than in the case of moving violations. Rarely \nwould a car's owner be able to convince an impartial \narbiter that his car really was not illegally parked and so \n15 should not be towed; few would be the occasions, \ntherefore, when notice and an opportunity to be heard in \nadvance of towing would prevent an unjust deprivation \nof a property interest. \n672 F.2d at 646. The determination that the sum of a car owner's unpaid tickets \nexceeds $200 is similarly cut and dried; and Shaheed has not offered any evidence \nor even argument that requiring a hearing before towing would reveal counting \nmistakes and thereby prevent erroneous towings. \nThird, a city's interest in towing from its streets cars that are repeatedly \nillegally parked is strong and the fiscal and administrative burdens of pre\u00ad\ndeprivation hearings would be prohibitive. Towing repeat violators of parking \nregulations deters car owners from flouting the city's laws and frees up parking \nspaces for car owners who abide by the laws. Requiring a hearing before towing is \nimpractical. As the Court in Sutton stated: \"There is no way that the city ... can \nnotify the owners of illegally parked cars that their cars will be towed and provide \nthem then and there with an opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the towing. \nTo require notice and hearing in advance is ... to prevent all towing of illegally \nparked cars.\" 672 F.2d at 645-46. \nAccordingly, I will dismiss Shaheed' s pre-seizure due process claim ( Count \nIV). \n16 2. Defendants' Post-Deprivation Due Process Claim \nWilmington argues that Count V should be dismissed because the City \nprovided notice of and gave Plaintiffs the opportunity for a post-impoundment \nhearing to challenge the lawfulness of their cars' seizures and impoundments. \nD .I. 16 at 14-1 7. Plaintiffs counter that a car owner cannot have a post\u00ad\nimpoundment hearing unless and until she pays the disputed fines and towing and \nstorage fees under protest, and .that this upfront payment requirement renders \nWilmington's post-deprivation remedies unconstitutional. D.I. 29 at 20-21. \nPlaintiffs cite no case law that supports their position. See D.I. 29 at 20-21. \nAnd here, too, the Mathews factors weigh against Plaintiffs' due process claim. As \ndiscussed above, see Section III.B. l, although the private interest affected by the \nCity's policy-the uninterrupted use of a car--can be significant, the risk of an \nerroneous deprivation is minimal. Moreover, the government's interest-ensuring \nthat the owner of the illegally parked vehicle pays for its removal from the street \nand retaining possession of the vehicle as security for payment of the outstanding \nticket debt and towing and storage fees-substantially outweighs the private \ninterest. Plaintiffs are in effect arguing that due process requires the immediate \nrelease of a ticketed car on demand. But a release-on-demand policy would \neffectively require the City to (1) provide an immediate, on-the-spot hearing; (2) \nuse its own funds to pay for the towing and storage of the vehicles itself; or (3) \n17 allow an illegally parked vehicle to remain on the street, thereby creating a safety \nhazard or depriving a law-abiding car owner of a parking spot. None of these \noptions is satisfactory. Accordingly, I agree with Wilmington that it does not \nviolate constitutional due process when it requires the o~ners of impounded . \nvehicles to pay their outstanding ticket fines and towing and storage fees before \nthey can have a hearing on the merits of their parking citations. Accord Goichman \nv. Rheuban Motors, Inc., 682 F.2d 1320, 1324 (9th Cir. 1982). I will therefore \ndismiss Count V. \nC. Plaintiffs' Unlawful Takings and Excessive Fines Claims \nIn Count I, Plaintiffs allege that the scrapping of their cars violates the Fifth \nAmendment's Takings Clause. D.I. 1 at 17-18. In Count VI, they allege that the \nscrapping of their cars violates the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. \nD.I. 1 at 27-29. \nThe Fifth Amendment, as applied under the Fourteenth Amendment, \nprohibits a city from taking \"private property ... for public use, without just \ncompensation.\" U.S. CONST. amend. V. A city, however, is \"not ... required to \ncompensate an owner for property which it has already lawfully acquired under the \nexercise of governmental authority other than the power of eminent domain.\" \nBennis v. Michigan, 516 U.S. 442,452 (1996). \n18 The Eighth Amendment provides that \"[ e ]xcessive bail shall not be required, \nnor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" U.S. \nCONST. amend. VIII. The amendment's Excessive Fines Clause \"limits the \ngovernment's power to extract payments, whether in cash or in kind, as \npunishment for some offense.\" United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321,328 \n(1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"The touchstone of the \nconstitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of \nproportionality[.]\" Id at 334. A fine, therefore, \"must bear some relationship to \nthe gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.\" Id. And a fine is \nunconstitutional \"if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's \noffense.\" Id. \nWilmington argues that Plaintiffs' Takings Clause claim should be \ndismissed \"[b]ecause Plaintiffs' vehicles were impounded pursuant to the City's \npolice powers, and not taken for a public use .... \" D.I. 16 at 17. It argues that \nPlaintiffs' excessive fines claim should be dismissed because the scrapping of \nPlaintiffs' cars \"was not a punishment imposed by the City\" but \"[r]ather ... part \nof the statutory process by which towing contractors may recover their costs.\" D.I. \n16 at 22. \nWilmington can't have it both ways. If it impounded Plaintiffs' cars \npursuant to its police powers, then Plaintiffs have a viable excessive fines claim, as \n19 I cannot agree with Wilmington that the surplus value gained from scrapping \nPlaintiffs' cars was, as a matter of law, not grossly disproportionate to Plaintiffs' \nalleged parking violations. If, on the other hand, Wilmington scrapped Plaintiffs' \ncars and retained the surplus value of those cars to pay for its towing contracts, \nthen Plaintiffs have a stated a viable takings claim. \nAccordingly, I will not dismiss Counts I and VI. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I will grant in part and deny in part \nWilmington's motion to dismiss. I will grant the motion with respect to Counts II, \nIII, IV, and V. I will deny the motion with respect to Counts I and VI. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n20 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAMEERA SHAHEED and EARL \nDICKERSON, \nPlaintiffs, \nV. \nCITY OF WILMINGTON, FIRST \nSTATE TOWING , LLC, and CITY \nTOWING SERVICES, LLC, \nDefendants.
