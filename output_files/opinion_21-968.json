(\u201cArthrex\u201d or \n\u201cDefendant\u201d) to transfer this case to the Middle District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).  \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES  Defendant \u2019s motion.1 \nI. BACKGROUND \n On June 30, 2021, P Tech, LLC (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed a complaint alleging that several of \nDefendant\u2019s products infringe one or more claims of six U.S. Patent s.  (D.I. 1).  Plaintiff is a \nDelaware corporation with a principal place of business in Riverview, Florida, in the Middle \nDistrict of Florida.  (D.I. 1  \u00b6 1).  P Tech\u2019s sole member and  an inventor of the a sserted patents, \nDr. Peter  Bonutti, resides in Florida and previously initiated and litigated a patent suit against \nArthrex in the  Middle District of Florida through another of his corporate entities, Bonutti Skeletal \nInnovations.  Other inventors listed on the  asserted patents live in Illinois and Mic higan. \n Defendant maintains its global headquarter s in Naples, Florida, in the Middle District of \nFlorida.  (D.I. 12, Ex. A, Sodeika Decl. \u00b6 2 ).  Defendant\u2019s design, development and manufacturing \nfacilities are also located in the  Middle District of Florid a, as are all personnel with relevant \nknowledge of the operation, manufacture, sale and marketing of the products accused of \ninfringement and all documents relating to those products.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5).  In addition, t wo former \nArthrex employees, Don Shuler and Bill Benavitz, who may have relevant knowledge  of the \ndesign, development, and distribution of the products  accused of infringement reside in the Middle \nDistrict of Florida.   (Id. \u00b6 10) .  \n \n1  On November 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a surreply with the \nproposed surreply attached.  (D.I. 20).  Plaintiff\u2019s motion is DENIED.  Arthrex\u2019s Reply in support of the motion to transfer venue di d not raise any \u201cnew evidence, facts, or \narguments\u201d meriting a sur -reply.  St. Clair Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., \n291 F.R.D. 75, 80 (D. Del. 2013). Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 8172 On September 22, 2021, D efendant moved to transfer this case to the Middle District of \nFlorida .  (D.I. 11).2  Plaintiff opposes transfer.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cA plaintiff, as the injured party, generally ha[s] been \u2018accorded [the] privilege of bringing \nan action where he chooses.\u2019\u201d  Helicos Biosciences Corp. v. Illumina, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 367, \n371 (D. Del. 2012) (quoting Norwood v. Kirkpatrick , 349 U.S. 29, 31 (1955)).  Plaintiff\u2019s choice \nof location in bringing the action \u201cshould not be lightly disturbed.\u201d  Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., \n55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995).   \nDistrict courts have the authority to transfer venue \u201c[f]or the convenie nce of parties and \nwitnesses, in the interest of justice, . . . to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).  The Third Circuit has made clear that, to  find that an action \u201cmight \nhave been brought\u201d in a distric t, \u201cvenue must have been proper in the transferee district and the \ntransferee court must have had power to command jurisdiction over all of the defendants.\u201d  Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 24 (3d Cir. 1970).   \nIf a court finds that an action \u201cmi ght have been brought\u201d in the proposed transferee district, \nthe court must then consider whether transfer is appropriate.  To these ends, the  Third Circuit has \nrecognized that:  \ncourts have not limited their consideration to the three enumerated \nfactors in \u00a7 1404(a) (convenience of parties, convenience of witnesses, or interests of justice), and, indeed, commentators have \ncalled on the courts to \u201cconsider all relevant factors to determine \nwhether on balance the litigation would more conveniently proceed \nand the interests of justice be better served by transfer to a different forum.\u201d  \n \n \n2  This case was assigned to the undersigned from The Honorable Leonard P. Stark on March  11, 2022.  Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 8183 Jumara, 55 F .3d at 879 (citation omitted).  The Jumara  court went on to describe twelve \u201cprivate \nand public interests protected by the language of \u00a7 1404(a).\u201d  Id.  The private interests include:  \nplaintiff\u2019s forum preference as manifested in the original choice; the \ndefendant\u2019s preference; whether the claim arose elsewhere; the \nconvenience of the parties as indicated by their relative physical and \nfinancial condition; the convenience of the witnesses \u2013 but only to \nthe extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and the l ocation of books and records (similarly \nlimited to the extent that the files could not be produced in the alternative forum).  \n \nId. (citations omitted).  The public interests include:  \nthe enforceability of the judgment; practical considerations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; the relative \nadministrative difficulty in the two fora resulting from court congestion; the local interest in deciding local controversies at home; the public policies of the fora; and the familiarity of th e trial \njudge with the applicable state law in diversity cases.  \n \nId. at 879- 80.  The party seeking transfer bears the burden \u201cto establish that a balancing of proper \ninterests weigh[s] in favor of transfer.\u201d  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25.  Courts have \u201cbroad discretion to \ndetermine, on an individualized, case -by-case basis, whether convenience and fairness \nconsiderations weigh in favor of transfer.\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 883.  However, \u201cunless the balance \nof convenience of the parties is strongly in favor of [the] defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum \nshould prevail.\u201d  Shutte , 431 F.2d at  25.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nAs an initial matter, the Court addresses the threshold inquiry under \u00a7 1404(a) \u2013 i.e., \nwhether this action might have originally been brought in the transferee district.  Defendant argues that this action could have originally be brought  in the Middle District of Florida  where Defendant \nhas its principal place of business and where the products were designed and developed.  Plaintiff \ndoes not dispute that.  Th e Court agrees that this case could have been filed in the Middle District \nof Fl orida, where Arthrex resides.  Thus, Court addresses the Jumara  factors in turn below.  Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 8194 1. Plaintiff\u2019s Forum Preference  \nThis factor weighs against transfer.  \u201cIt is black letter law that a plaintiff\u2019s choice of a \nproper forum is a paramount consideration in any determination of a transfer request\u201d \u2013 one that \n\u201cshould not be lightly disturbed.\u201d  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25 (internal quotations and citation omitted).  \n\u201cAssuming jurisdiction and proper venue, weight is given to plaintiff\u2019s choice because it is \nplaintiff\u2019s choice and a strong showing under the statutory criteria in favor of another forum is then required as a prerequisite to transfer.\u201d  Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Giant Food, Inc., \n392 F.  Supp. 761, 763 n.4 (D. Del. 1975).  \nDefendant recognizes that Plaintiff\u2019s choice was to litigate in Delaware and  that this weighs \nagainst transfer.  Defendant nev ertheless argues that Plaintiff\u2019s choice should be given l ittle \ndeference given Plaintiff\u2019s \u201clack of presence in this district.\u201d  (D.I. 12 at 6).  Plaintiff argues that its choice of forum is to be given \u201cparamount consideration\u201d regardless of its connecti ons to \nDelaware.  ( D.I. 17 at 7).   \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff.  Although Plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum is not dispositive, \nthe Court will \u201cnot discount Plaintiff[s\u2019] choice of forum based on a lack of physical ties to Delaware.\u201d  Abraxis Bioscience, LL C v. HBT Labs, Inc., No. 18- 2019 (RGA), 2019 WL 2270440, \nat *2 (D. Del. May 28, 2019).  This Court follows the reasoning in Burroughs Wellcome , in which \nJudge Stapleton found that the Third Circuit\u2019s rule that plaintiff\u2019s choice is of paramount considerati on is \u201can across -the-board rule favoring plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum.\u201d  392 F.  Supp. at \n762-63; see also  VLSI Tech. LLC v. Intel Corp., No. CV 18- 966-CFC, 2018 WL 5342650, at *4 \n(D. Del. Oct. 29, 2018).  As Judge Stapleton noted, \u201cassuming [plaintiff\u2019s choice] is to be given some weight in cases where the plaintiff lives in the forum state, it is difficult to see why it should not also be given weight when the plaintiff lives in [another] state.\u201d  Burroughs Wellcome , \n392 F.  Supp. at 763 n.4.  This Court doe s not see a distinction here that justifies affording less Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 5 of 12 PageID #: 8205 weight to Plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum.  Plaintiff\u2019s choice to litigate in Delaware remains entitled to \nparamount consideration. \n2. Defendant\u2019s Forum Preference  \nThis factor favors transfer.  Defendant\u2019s interest in having this case transferred to the \nMiddle District of Florida is apparent.     \n3. Whether the Claims Arose Elsewhere  \nThis factor is neutral.   Defendant contends that this factor favors transfer because \u201call \nArthrex activities related to the research, design, development, manufacturing and marketing of the Accused Products occurred in the Middle District of Florida.\u201d   (D.I. 12 at 7).  The Court \nacknowledges that these facts may weigh slightly in favor of tr ansfer.  See In re Hoffman- La Roche, \nInc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also Smart Audio Techs., LLC v. Apple, Inc., \n910 F.  Supp. 2d 718, 730 (D. Del. 2012) (\u201c[T]o some extent, [infringement] claims ar[i]se where \nthe allegedly infringing products [a]re designed and manufactured.\u201d (quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original)).  Patent -infringement claims , however, arise wherever alleged \ninfringement has occurred. See Treehouse Avatar LLC v. Valve Corp., 170 F. Supp. 3d 706, 710 (D. Del. 2016) (citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a); Red Wing Show Co., Inc. v. Hockerson -Halberstadt, \nInc., 148 F.3d 1355, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).  And it is noteworthy that neither Defendant nor its \ncorporate declarant assert that the accused products are not used or sold in this District.  Indeed, \nas Plaintiff points outs, Defendant\u2019s website advertises partnerships with companies who \n\u201cdistribute[] innovative  orthopedic products\u201d in Southern Delaware and Defendant\u2019s products are \n\u201cdisplayed in advertising materials for medical centers in Delaware.\u201d  (D.I. 17 at 10 -11).  In its \nreply papers, Defendant ignores this point .  Selling or offering to sell the accused products in \nDelaware would constitute an alleged act of infringement within the meaning of \u00a7 271(a), thereby Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 8216 giving rise to a claim that arises in this District.  Therefore, the Court concludes that this factor is \nneutral.   \n4. Convenience of the Parties as In dicated by Their Relative Physical \nand Financial Condition       \nThis factor is neutral.   Determining convenience of the parties requires the Court to \nconsider:  (1) the parties\u2019 physical location; (2) the associated logistical and operational costs to \nthe parties in traveling to Delaware \u2013 as opposed to the proposed transferee district \u2013 for litigation \npurposes; and (3) the relative ability of each party to bear these costs in light of its size and financial wherewithal.  See MEC Resources, LLC v. Apple, I nc., 269 F. Supp. 3d 218, 225 (D. Del.  2017) \n(citing Memory Integrity, LLC v. Intel Corp., No. 13- 1804 (GMS), 2015 WL 632026, at *4 \n(D. Del. Feb. 13, 2015) (internal quotations omitted)).  Because Defendant is a Delaware \ncorporation, it \u201cmust prove that li tigating in Delaware would impose a unique or unusual burden \non [its] operations.\u201d  Graphics Props. Holdings Inc. v. Asus Comput. Int\u2019l, Inc., 964 F. Supp. 2d 320, 325 (D. Del. 2013) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);  see \nalso Universal Secure Registry, LLC v. Apple, Inc. , No. 17- 585 (CFC) (SRF), 2018 WL 4502062, \nat *3 (D. Del. Sept. 19, 2018) (\u201cWhen a party accept[s] the benefits of incorporation under the laws of the State of Delaware, a company should not be success ful in arguing that litigation in \nDelaware is inconvenient, absent some showing of a unique or unexpected burden.\u201d (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted) (alteration in original)).   \nHere, Defendant argues that transferring to the  Middle District of Florida would be more \nconvenient because Defendant is headquartered in that district and the design and manufacture of \nits accused products are there.  Defendant , however,  is incorporated in Delaware  and must \ndemonstrate that litigating here \u201cwould impo se a unique or unusual burden on [its] operations.\u201d  \nGraphics Props. Holdings , 964 F. Supp. at 325.  Thus, e ven if the  Court accepts the asserted Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 8227 reasons that make litigating in that district more convenient for Defendant, the Court is unable to \nconclude t hat Defendant cannot shoulder the burden of litigating here instead or that this would \npresent some unique hardship on Defendant.3   \n5. Convenience of the Witnesses  \nThis factor is neutral.  This factor carries weight \u201conly to the extent that the witnesses ma y \nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora.\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879; see also VLSI , 2018 \nWL 5342650, at *7 (citing Smart Audio, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 732 (noting that this factor applies \nonly insofar as \u201ca witness actually will refuse to testify absent a subpoena\u201d)).  \u201c[W]itnesses who are employed by a party carry no weight\u201d because \u201ceach party is able, indeed, obligated to procure the attendance of its own employees for trial.\u201d  Affymetrix, Inc. v. Synteni, Inc., 28 F. Supp. 2d 192, 203 (D. Del. 1998).  \u201c[T]he Court should be particularly concerned not to countenance undue inconvenience to third- party witnesses[] who have no direct connection to the litigation.\u201d  \nIntellectual Ventures I , 842 F. Supp. 2d at 757.   \nHere, each party has identified potential non- party witnesses  who may be inconvenienced \nin one forum or the other .  (D.I. 12 at 10; D.I. 17 at 15- 16).  Defendant has identified two former \nemployees with relevant knowledge  of the design and development of the products accused of \ninfringement, both of whom live in the Middle District of Florida.  Plaintiff has identified \nemployees of Liberty Surgical, Inc ., located in nearby West Chester, Pennsylvania regarding \nArthrex -approved training of doctors to use the accused products .  And Plaintiff has identified t wo \nco-inventors of the asserted patent  who are not employees of Plaintiff \u2013 one of whom lives in \nMich igan and the other in Illinois.  No party, however, has provided any specificity as to reasons \n \n3  In fact, Defendant made no attempt to show that litigating here would present a unique or \nunexpected hardship on its operations ( e.g., diverting resources, etc.) and thus , there is no \nbasis for the Court to conclude otherwise.  Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 8238 there are to think that any of these potential witnesses \u201c will \u2018actually\u2019 be unavailable for trial (as \nopposed to the proffer of a guess or speculation on that f ront.) \u201d  Genedics, LLC v. Meta Co ., No. \nCV 17 -1062- CJB, 2018 WL 417950, at *7 (D. Del. Jan. 12, 2018).  Thus, the Court considers this \nfactor neutral.  \n6. Location of Books and Records  \nThis factor slightly favors transfer.  Jumara instructs the Court to give weight to the \nlocation of books and records necessary to the case only \u201cto the extent that the files [and other \nevidence] could not be produced in the alternative forum.\u201d  Jumara , 55 F.3d at 879.  Defendant \nargues that this factor favors transfer because substantially all of Defendant\u2019s relevant books and records are located in the Middle District of Florida  as are conception, development and \nconstruction of embodiments of the a sserted patents .  (D.I. 12 at 11).  \u201cIn patent infr ingement \ncases, the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer.  Consequently, the place where the defendant\u2019s documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that location.\u201d  In re Genentech, Inc. , 566 F.3d 1338, 1345 (Fed. C ir. 2009).  That being said, the Third Circuit \nhas instructed that the relevant consideration here is whether the evidence could not be produced in the competing fora.  See  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  With the state of technology in litigation today \nand the e ase with which documentary evidence can be produced electronically, the Court finds \nthat this factor \u2013 although favoring transfer \u2013 should be afforded minimal weight.  See, e.g., \nBlackbird Tech LLC v. E.L.F. Beauty, Inc., No. 19- 1150- CFC, 2020 WL 2113528, at *4 (D. Del. \nMay 4, 2020); Intellectual Ventures I , 842 F. Supp. 2d at 759.  Therefore, this factor weighs in \nfavor of transfer, but only slightly.    Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 8249 7. Enforceability of the Judgment  \nThis factor is neutral as judgments from this District and the Middle District of Florida \nwould be equally enforceable.  \n8. Practical Considerations  \nThis factor is neutral .  The Court must consider \u201cpractical considerations that could make \nthe trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive.\u201d  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  Defendant argues that this \nfactor weighs in favor of transfer because both Plaintiff and Defendant are headquartered in the \nMiddle District of Florida.  (D.I. 12 at 11).  In response, Plaintiff argues tha t Defendant is simply \nrepeating its arguments for other factors and that these considerations should not be double -\ncounted.  (D.I. 17 at 15).  The Court agrees with Plaintiff.  Defendant\u2019s contentions \u201chave been \nraised, in the same way, as to other Jumara factors, and so the Court will not \u2018double -count\u2019 them \nhere.\u201d  Elm 3DS Innovations LLC v. SK Hynix, Inc., No. 14- 1432 (LPS) (CJB), 2015 WL 4967139, \nat *11 (D. Del. Aug. 20, 2015).  Therefore, because there is no broader public benefit to this case \nproceedi ng in this Court versus the Middle District of Florida (or vice versa), this factor is neutral.  \nSee W.R. Berkley Corp. v. Niemela , No. 17- 32 (GMS), 2017 WL 4081871, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 15, \n2017) (finding factor to be neutral when \u201cneither party addresse[ d] the broader public costs of \nproceeding in one district or the other\u201d).   \n9. Relative Administrative Difficulty Due to Court Congestion  \nThis factor is neutral .  The Court takes judicial notice of the most recent Judicial Caseload \nProfiles, as of December 31, 2021.4  The Middle District of Florida  appears to be somewhat less \ncongested than this District: Delaware reports 600 pending cases per judgeship and averaging 36.5  \nmonths to trial compared with 5 73 pending cases per judgeship and 28.7 months to trial in the \n \n4  https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/data_tables/fcms_na_distprofile1231.2021.pdf  Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 82510 Middle District of Florida.  The pending caseloads are comp arable.  And a lthough the time to trial \nis slightly faster in the Middle District of Florida, the Court finds this factor  to be largely neutral.  \n10. Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home \nThis factor is neutral .  Defendant argues that this fact or \u201cweighs heavily in favor of transfer, \nbecause both of these  parties operate their businesses from the Middle District of Florida .\u201d  (D.I.  12 \nat 13).  The Court disagrees.  \u201c[I]n patent infringement cases the local interest factor is typically \nneutral \u2018b ecause patent issues do not give rise to a local controversy or implicate local interests.\u2019\u201d  \nIntellectual Ventures I LLC v. Checkpoint Software Techs. Ltd., 797 F. Supp. 2d 472, 486 (D. Del. \n2011) (quoting TriStrata Tech., Inc. v. Emulgen Labs., Inc., 537 F. Supp. 2d 635, 643 (D. Del. 2008)).  Although Defendant does have connections with the Middle District of Florida,  the Court \nfinds it relevant that Defendant is a global company with a employees throughout the world.\n5  This \nsuggests that Defendant  is not a \u201clocal\u201d company in the Middle District of Florida such that local \ninterests are, in fact, implicated here.  See, e.g., Rosebud LMS, Inc. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. \n17-1712- CFC, 2018 WL 6061343, at *7 (D. Del. Nov. 20, 2018) (\u201cSalesforce, with t housands of \nemployees in dozens of countries, is not a \u2018local\u2019 company; and its dispute with Rosebud, which does not reside in California, is not a \u2018local controversy\u2019 in the Northern District.\u201d).  Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, this factor is neutral.   \n11. Publi c Policies of the Fora \nDefendant contends  that this factor is neutral.  In the Court\u2019s view, however, this factor \nweighs slightly against transfer because both Plaintiff and Defendant are Delaware corporation s \nand public policy encourages Delaware corporat ions to resolve disputes in Delaware courts.  See, \n \n5  Defendant does not dispute that it is a multinational company with thousands of \nemployees across the world.  ( See D.I. 17 at 19).  Case 1:21-cv-00968-MN   Document 24   Filed 05/11/22   Page 11 of 12 PageID #: 82611 e.g., Graphics Props. Holdings Inc., 964 F. Supp. 2d at 331 (even where only one party is a \nDelaware corporation, public policy encouraging Delaware corporations to resolve disputes in Delaware weighs agai nst transfer).  \n12. Familiarity of the Trial Judge with the Applicable State Law in \nDiversity Cases         \nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral as Plaintiff\u2019s claims arise under federal patent \nlaws and the familiarity of the respective districts with state law is not applicable.   \n13. Balancing the Private and Public Factors  \nAfter balancing the twelve Jumara factors, the Court concludes that this case should not \nbe transferred to the Middle District of Florida .  Eight factors are neutral, and t wo factors weigh \nin favor of transfer, with one favoring transfer only slightly.  Two factors weigh against transfer, \nincluding Plaintiff\u2019s choice of this forum, which is to be given paramount consideration.
