INTRODUCTION \nThis appeal arises from the chapter 7 cases I of Windhaven Top Insurance \nHoldings, LLC and certain affiliates (together, \"Debtors\"). Appellant Risk & \nRegulatory Consulting, LLC (\"RRC\") is special deputy receiver of non-debtor \nWindhaven National Insurance Company (\"WNIC\"), a domestic insurer subject to \nTexas liquidation proceedings pending in the District Court of Travis County, \nTexas (\"Texas Court\"). Debtors rendered various administrative services to WNIC \nand other insurers. When the parties became financially distressed in 2019, \nDebtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. Because \nWNIC is a domestic insurer, it was not eligible for relief under the Bankruptcy \nCode. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(b)(2). Instead, WNIC was placed into receivership and \nliquidation pursuant to the Texas Insurer Receivership Act, codified at Texas \nInsurance Code\u00a7\u00a7 443.001, et seq. (\"Texas Insurance Code\"). \n1 The docket of the chapter 7 cases, captioned In re Windhaven Top Insurance \nHoldings, LLC, No. 20-10524 (JTD) (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as B.D.I. _.\" \nThe appendix (D.I. 10-1) filed in support of appellant's opening brief is cited \nherein as \"A \" The underlying dispute between RRC and the trustee appointed in the \nDebtors' chapter 7 cases (\"Trustee\")2 concerns the ownership of funds in the \npossession of the Debtors at the time the bankruptcy cases were filed. RRC filed a \nmotion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief from the Bankruptcy Code's \nautomatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), and authority to commence litigation \nin the Texas Court to settle the dispute regarding ownership of the funds and \nenforce RRC' s asserted rights under the Texas Insurance Code. The stay relief \nmotion relied on the reverse preemption doctrine under the McCarran-Ferguson \nAct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015,3 which generally provides that if a specific state law \npromulgated \"for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance\" conflicts \nwith a generally applicable federal law, the state law c~ntrols. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1012(b ). RRC argued that the dispute over the ownership of funds triggered \nreverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act because various Texas \n2 By Stipulation filed November 21, 2022 (D.1. 13), appellees Atalaya Capital \nManagement LP, Atalaya Special Opportunities Fund VII LP, and Midtown \nMadison Management LLC have withdrawn from the appeal. \n3 \"The McCarran-F erguson Act has been interpreted as overturning traditional \nfederal rules of preemption and allowing state insurance statutes to 'reverse \npreempt' federal statutes that affect state regulation of the insurance industry.\" In \nre First Assured Warranty Corp., 383 B.R. 502, 531 (Banlcr. D. Colo. 2008) ( citing \nGenordv. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Michigan (Genord), 440 F.3d 802,805 (6th \nCir. 2006), cert denied, 549 U.S. 1030 (2006) (discussing McCarran-Ferguson Act \nand \"reverse preemption\"); Ruthardt v.

D. Del. 2021), each issued on \nOctober 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court determined that the parties' dispute did \nnot implicate the McCarran-Ferguson Act and denied the Lift Stay Motion. For \nthe reasons set forth herein, the Court affirms the Order. \nII. BACKGROUND \nA. The Parties and the MGA Agreements \nWNIC was a domestic property and casualty insurance company domiciled \nin the state of Texas and mainly wrote non-standard automobile insurance policies. \nWNIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Debtor, Windhaven National Holding \nCompany. (A016). Windhaven National Holding Company also owned a number \nof other affiliated entities, whose primary purpose was to render administrative \nservices to WNIC and other insurers. (A006). These affiliated entities are all \nDebtors in the jointly administered bankruptcy proceedings. \n3 Debtors, Wind.haven Insurance Services, LLC and Wind.haven Select, LLC, \nserved as managing general agents or \"MGAs.\" {Al83). The MGAs were \nresponsible for performing various administrative responsibilities for WNIC \nrelated to the underwriting of policies, including collecting premiums. {Al83-84). \nThe rights and obligations ofWNIC and the MGAs are governed by the \nterms and conditions of two separate Managing General Agency Agreements or \n\"MGA Agreements.\" {Al83). The MGA Agreements are subject to regulation by \nthe state of Texas under the Texas Insurance Code and the Texas Administrative \nCode. (A008-18). Among the terms that agreements between insurers and MGAs \nmust include is a provision that \"all funds and invested assets of the insurer are the \nexclusive property of the insurer, held for the benefit of the insurer and are subject \nto the control of the insurer.\" 28 Tex. Admin. Code\u00a7 7.204(a)(2)(D)(viii). \nFurther, under applicable law, the MGAs \"hold[] money on behalf of an insured or \ninsurer in a fiduciary capacity .... \" Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 4053.106. The MGA \nAgreements contain the above statutorily required terms. \nThe following terms of the MGA Agreements provide that the MGAs hold \npremiums collected on behalf of WNIC in trust and in a fiduciary capacity for the \nbenefit of WNIC: \nSection 7 .1 -\"The Managing General Agent shall accept \nand hold all premiums collected and other funds relating \nto the business written under this Agreement in a \nfiduciary capacity.\" \n4 Section 7.4 -\"The Managing General Agent shall not \ncommingle any premium or escrow funds with its \npersonal accounts or other agency funds or funds held by \nthe Managing General Agent in any other capacity.\" \nSection 7.6-\"The Managing General Agent shall act as \ntrustee for the Company on the Premium Escrow \nAccount.\" \n(A077). In consideration for rendering these administrative services, the MGAs \nreceived a commission they retained from the collected premiums. (A070). \nSignificantly, the MGA Agreements are clear that \"[t]he privilege of retaining \ncommissions shall not be construed as changing the fiduciary capacity [ of collected \npremiums].\" (A077 at\u00a7 7.1). \nThe statutory and contractual provisions requiring the MGAs to hold \nWNIC's funds in a fiduciary capacity become significant when an insurer is placed \ninto liquidation. (A023). Whereas the Texas Insurance Code generally permits a \nperson to setoff debits and credits against an insurer in liquidation, it forbids setoff \nif the funds are held in a fiduciary capacity. (A026-27). Specifically, the Texas \nInsurance Code provides that, \"[a] setoff may not be allowed in favor of any \nperson if ... the obligation of the person is as a trustee or a fiduciary .... \" Tex. \nIns. Code\u00a7 443.209(b)(3)(A). \n5 B. The Liquidation and Bankruptcy Filings \nIn 2019, WNIC and the Debtors became financially distressed. Because \nWNIC is a domestic insurer, it was not eligible for relief under the Bankruptcy \nCode. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(b )(2). Instead, WNIC was placed into receivership and \nliquidation under the Texas Insurer Receivership Act. (A006). On or about \nFebruary 21, 2020, the State of Texas filed its Original Petition, Application for \nOrder Appointing Liquidator and Request for Injunctive Relief with the Texas \nCourt at the request of the Texas Commissioner of Insurance. (A019). On \nFebruary 27, 2020, the Texas Court entered an Agreed Temporary Restraining \nOrder (\"TRO\"). (Id.) The TRO expressly enjoined and restrained dozens of \nspecifically named persons and entities (including the MGAs) from: \n[mjaking any claim, charge or offset, or commencing \n[]or prosecuting any action, appeal, or arbitration, \nincluding administrative proceedings, or obtaining any \npreference, judgment, attachment, garnishment, or other \nlien, or making any levy against Defendant or \nDefendant's Property, except as permitted by Tex. Ins. \nCode Chapter 443. \n(A095) (emphasis added). Upon commencement of the receivership proceeding, \nthe Texas Insurer Receivership Act imposed an automatic stay of actions against \nWNIC, in effect for the duration of the receivership proceedings, and a stay of \nactions against WNIC's property is in effect for as long as the property belongs to \nthe receivership estate. Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.008(c), (t). \n6 On March 5, 2020, the Texas Court entered its Order Appointing Liquidator, \nPermanent Injunction and Notice of Automatic Stay (the \"Liquidation Order\"), \nwhereby it appointed the Texas Commissioner of Insurance (\"Liquidator\") as \nLiquidator of WNIC's property for the benefit of policyholders and creditors. \n(AO 19). The Liquidator thereafter appointed RRC as the Special Deputy Receiver. \n(A006). Under Texas Insurance Code\u00a7 443.154(a), RRC is authorized to exercise \nall of the Liquidator's powers with respect to the WNIC receivership, subject only \nto limitations imposed by the Liquidator. Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.154(a). \nIn connection with the Liquidation Order, the Texas Court issued a \npermanent injunction pursuant to Texas Insurance Code\u00a7 443.008(a), enjoining, \namong other things, all claimants or creditors of WNIC from asserting claims or \ncauses of action against WNIC except as permitted by the Texas Insurance Code. \n(A019). \nThe Liquidation Order vests the Liquidator \"with title to all of Defendant's \nproperty as defined in Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.004(a)(20).\" (Al00). It further directs \nand authorizes the Liquidator to \"take possession and control of [WNIC's] \nProperty, wherever located\" pursuant to Tex. Ins.\u00b7Code \u00a7 443.151(a). (Al00-01). \nAccordingly, what comprises WNIC's receivership estate broadly includes: \nproperty of any kind or nature, ... including but not \nlimited to money, funds, cash, ... account deposits, \nstatutory deposits, special deposits, . . . funds held in \nshared escrow or trust accounts, ... whether owned \n7 individually, jointly, or severally, wherever located, and \nall rights, claims or causes of action belonging to \nDefendant, whether asserted or not ... (collectively, \nDefendant's Property). The Liquidator's title shall extend \nto Defendant's Property regardless of the name in which \nsuch items are held, or where such items are located. \n(Id.) The Texas Court further ordered that the automatic stay take effect pursuant \nto Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.008 with respect to, among other things, actions against \nWNIC or its property effective on the commencement of the proceeding. (Id.) \nThe Court also issued a permanent injunction under Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.008 to \n\"carry out the provisions of Tex. Ins. Code Chapter 443, and prevent irreparable \ninjury, loss and damage to the general public and [WNIC]'s creditors.\" (A102). \nThe injunction enjoins all claimants from \"asserting claims or causes of action \nagainst [WNIC], except as permitted by the Insurer Receivership Act.\" (Id.) \nBetween March 5, 2020 and April 3, 2020, each of the Debtors filed \nvoluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. (A182). These cases \nhave been jointly administered in the Bankruptcy Court. (Id). \nC. The Disputed Funds \nVarious disputes between RRC and the Trustee arose concerning the \nfollowing funds (collectively, the \"Disputed Funds\"): (1) approximately \n$3,000,000 currently held in Premium Escrow Accounts nominally titled in the \nnames of the MG As, which they hold as trustees and fiduciaries, for the benefit of \nWNIC, (2) approximately $57,200 held in a refund account which Windhaven \n8 Services, LLC holds as a fiduciary for the benefit of certain ofWNIC's policy \nholders, (3) an additional $338,923.27 belonging to WNIC that appears to have \nbeen inadvertently deposited into a premium escrow account of another insurance \ncompany, which funds are similarly held by the debtors as trustees and fiduciaries \nfor the benefit of WNIC, and (4) more than $3,000,000 of payments by consumers \nfor insurance policies issued by WNIC, held by a credit card processor in the name \nof one of the Debtors, in a fiduciary capacity per the MGA Agreements. \nRRC asserts that the Disputed Funds are not property of the bankruptcy \nestates because they are held by the Debtors in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit \nofWNIC. The Trustee has commenced an adversary proceeding seeking a \ndetermination that the Disputed Funds ( as well as certain tax refunds not \nreferenced in the Lift Stay Motion) are property of the bankruptcy estates. Burtch \nv. Risk & Regulatory Consulting, LLC, Adv. No. 22-50232 (JTD) (Bankr. D. Del.). \nD. Lift Stay Motion \nOn September 11, 2020, RRC filed its Motion for Relief from the Automatic \nStay to Litigate Certain Disputes in the District Court of Travis County, Texas \n(A004-Al 16) (the \"Lift Stay Motion\"). Through the Lift Stay Motion, RRC \nsought relief from the automatic stay to commence litigation in the Texas Court to \ndetermine ownership of Disputed Funds and enforce its asserted rights under the \nTexas Insurance Code. RRC asserted that the Bankruptcy Code is reverse \n9 preempted by the Texas Insurance Code and, as such, cause existed to modify the \nautomatic stay. The Trustee filed an objection (Al 17-A135), and Atalaya Special \nOpportunities Fund VII LP filed ajoinder to the Trustee's objection (A136-138). \nRRC filed its reply on October 13, 2020 (A139-A144), and the Bankruptcy Court \nheld oral argument on October 14, 2020 (A152:21-Al 79:4), ultimately taking the \nmatter under advisement (Al 78:14-15). \nE. The Opinion and Order \nOn October 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Opinion and Order \ndenying the Lift Stay Motion. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that the dispute is, \n\"at its core, ... a contractual dispute between the parties ... ,\" and that the \nBankruptcy Court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the \nproperty held by the Debtors at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petitions. \nIn re Windhaven, 636 B.R. at 603. The Bankruptcy Court further concluded that \nsuch a determination, based on its interpretation of the applicable MGA \nAgreements, was not reverse preempted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act because \nsuch a determination of property ownership does not invalidate, impair, or \nsupersede the Texas Insurance Code. Id. \nOn October 27, 2021, RRC filed a timely notice of appeal. (A204). The \nappeal is fully briefed. (D.I. 10, 11, 12). No party requested oral argument. \n10 ID. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe Order denying RRC' s Lift Stay Motion is final, and this Court has \njurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. The sole issue on appeal \nis whether the Bankruptcy Court erred by concluding that the McCarran-Ferguson \nAct was not implicated by the disputes between the parties. (D.I. 10 at 4). \nWhether a state regulatory scheme is invalidated, impaired, or superseded by a \nfederal law is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. Weiss v. First Unum Life \nIns. Co., 482 F.3d 254,263 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Humana Inc. v. Forsyth, 525 \nU.S. 299, 311-14 (1999)). \nIV. PARTIES' CONTENTIONS \nRRC argues that the Bankruptcy Court mischaracterized the dispute as \nmerely requiring a determination as to what constitutes property of the estate, \nwhich did implicate the Texas Insurance Code. (D.I. 10 at 20-23 & 31-34). \nAccording to RRC, the Bankruptcy Court failed to recognize \"the myriad of Texas \nInsurance Code statutes regulating the business of insurance which governed the \ndisputes between the parties.\" (Id. at 24). Specifically, RRC argues that the \nBankruptcy Court ignored the Texas Insurance Code's anti-setoff statute and \npriority scheme (id. at 24-26 & 37-38), which, RRC asserts, is central to the \nparties' dispute, as well as jurisdictional provisions intended to foreclose litigation \nover receivership property in venues other than the Texas Court (id. at 27-30). \n11 The Trustee maintains that the Bankruptcy Court correctly decided that the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act does not operate to divest the federal court's exclusive \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(e) to determine what is and is not property of \nthe bankruptcy estates. (D.I. 11 at 8). The Trustee argues that RRC has failed to \nstate grounds for reverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act because \nthere is no inconsistency between the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction over \nproperty of the bankruptcy estate under the Bankruptcy Code and the Texas \nCourt's jurisdiction over property of the receivership estate under the Texas \nInsurance Code. (Id. at 9-17). The Trustee further asserts that the parties' dispute \ndoes not implicate the Texas Insurance Code's limitations on rights of setoff or its \npriority scheme. (Id. at 17-20). While RRC cites a handful of out-of-district \ndecisions holding that a bankruptcy court's determination of certain property \ndisputes would conflict with state insurance law, the Trustee asserts that the \nBankruptcy Court's decision here falls in line with decisions from this district and \nothers holding that the Bankruptcy Court's \"exclusive jurisdiction over \ndeterminations related to property of the estate does not support reverse\u00ad\npreemption,\" and the fact that \"a federal action may have a financial impact on the \nassets of the insolvent insurer's estate does not necessarily indicate a state's \nliquidation proceeding is 'impaired.\"' (See id. at 14 (quoting In re Patriot Nat'!, \n12 Inc., 623 B.R. 696, 709-10 (D. Del. 2020); and In re First Assured Warranty \nCorp., 383 B.R. 502, 541 n.38 (Banlcr. D. Colo. 2008)). \nV. ANALYSIS \nA. The McCarran-Ferguson Act \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that, in \ngeneral, federal law preempts any conflicting state law. The McCarran-Ferguson \nAct creates an exception to the general rule of federal supremacy with respect to \nlaws enacted \"for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\" It states: \n(a) State regulation. The business of insurance, and \nevery person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws \nof the several States which relate to the regulation or \ntaxation of such business. \n(b) Federal regulation. No Act of Congress shall be \nconstrued to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law \nenacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the \nbusiness of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon \nsuch business, unless such Act specifically relates to the \nbusiness of insurance .... \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012. The McCarran-Ferguson Act thus precludes application of a \nfederal statute in face of state law \"enacted ... for the purpose of regulating the \nbusiness of insurance,\" if the federal measure does not \"specifically relat[ e] to the \nbusiness of insurance,\" and would \"invalidate, impair, or supersede\" the state's \nlaw. Department of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491,501 (1993). \n13 The parties did not dispute that the relevant Texas statutes were \"enacted for \nthe purpose of regulating the business of insurance,\" or that the Bankruptcy Code \ndoes not specifically relate to the business of insurance. The sole issue before the \nBankruptcy Court was therefore whether exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to \ndetermine what is and is not property of the Debtors' estates would \"invalidate, \nimpair, or supersede\" any Texas law that related to the WNIC liquidation. \nThe Supreme Court defined each of these terms in its Humana decision \n\"Invalidate\" ordinarily means \"to render ineffective, generally without providing a \nreplacement rule or law.\" Humana, 525 U.S. at 307. \"Supersede\" ordinarily means \n\"to displace ( and thus render ineffective) while providing a substitute rule.\" Id. In \nHumana, the Court clarified the concept of \"impairment\" under 15 U .S.C. \u00a7 \n10 l 2{b) by stating: \nId. at 310. When federal law does not directly conflict with state \nregulation, and when application of the federal law would \nnot frustrate any declared state policy or interfere with a \nState's administrative regime, the McCarran-Ferguson \nAct does not preclude its application. \nB. The Opinion Misapplies the McCarran-Ferguson Act Test \nThe Bankruptcy Court was required to ascertain whether: \"(1) the federal \nstatute in question does not specifically relate to the business of insurance, (2) the \nstate statute was enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, \n14 and (3) the federal statute would invalidate, impair or supersede the state statute.\" \nSee In re PRS Ins. Grp., Inc., 294 B.R. 609, 612 (Bankr. D. Del. 2003) ajf'd, 2005 \nWL 4121639 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2005). \nThe parties did not dispute that the Bankruptcy Code does not specifically \nrelate to the business of insurance, or that the relevant Texas statutes were \"enacted \nfor the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\" In re Windhaven, 636 \nB.R. at 602. The sole remaining issue for the Bankruptcy Court to consider was \nthe preemption analysis under the third prong of the McCarran-Ferguson Act \ntest-\"whether the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the MGA Agreements \ninvalidates, impairs, or supersedes state law\"-such that the Bankruptcy Court \nmight consider the issue raised by the Lift Stay Motion: \"under the MGA \nAgreements, who is entitled to funds in the Premium Escrow Accounts held by the \nDebtors and the fund held by the non-party credit card processor in the name of the \nDebtors.\" Id. \nRather than conduct the preemption analysis and consider whether such an \nexercise would \"invalidate, impair, or supersede\" the various Texas Insurance \nCode statutes cited by RRC, tlie Opinion simply rejects RRC's assertion: \nRRC asserts that this is a matter of the Texas Insurance \nCode; however, what the Court is tasked with \ninterpreting is the MGA Agreements. The Texas \nInsurance Code does not govern all aspects of insurance \ncompanies but only the business of insurance. \n15 Id. The Bankruptcy Court's analysis then turned to whether the dispute between \nthe Trustee and RRC \"pertains to the business of insurance.\" See In re Windhaven, \n636 B.R. at 603. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that the funds dispute \"does not \ngo to the business of insurance, policyholders, or public interest,\" and that it was \nmerely a contract dispute between two parties that did not implicate the McCarran\u00ad\nFerguson Act. Id. \nI agree with RRC that the Bankruptcy Court's focus on the nature of the \ndispute between the parties obfuscates the applicable test. The test is not whether a \ndispute between two parties relates to the business of insurance, but instead \nwhether the applicable state statute was enacted for the purpose of regulating the \nbusiness of insurance. Once the Bankruptcy Court (correctly) concluded that the \nTexas Insurance Code provisions-including the anti-setoff and claim priority \nprovisions cited by RRC-regulated the business of insurance, the analysis should \nhave instead turned to a preemption analysis, i.e., whether there was any conflict \nbetween the Texas Insurance Code provisions and the Bankruptcy Code. \nThis is further illustrated by the Bankruptcy Court's extensive discussion of \nFabe in holding that the Bankruptcy Code did not impair or supersede provisions \nof the Texas Insurance Code. See In re Windhaven, 636 B.R. at 602-03. Fabe, \nhowever, dealt exclusively with the second McCarran-Ferguson Act element\u00ad\nwhether the underlying state insurance statute was enacted for the purpose of \n16 regulating insurance-an element the Bankruptcy Court had already concluded \nwas satisfied. See Fabe, 508 U.S. at 505-08. Fabe addressed the prong of the test \nthat RRC and the Trustee did not dispute. \nThe Bankruptcy Court did not examine whether its determination \"under the \nMGA Agreements, [as to] who is entitled to [the Disputed] funds\" may invalidate, \nimpair, or supersede the Texas Insurance Law provisions cited by RRC\u00ad\nincluding, but not limited to, Texas Insurance Code\u00a7 443.209's anti-setoff statute \nand\u00a7 443.301 's claim priority statute. Indeed, RRC's main argument is that the \nparties' dispute is centered on the Trustee's alleged intention to collect a debt owed \nby WNIC by means of setoff, which, even if permitted under the MGA \nAgreements, may invalidate the Texas Insurance Code's anti-setoff provision \napplicable to fiduciaries. (See D.I. 10 at 1-3, 16-17, 24-25). Such a result, RRC \nargues, would also impair the Texas Insurance Code's priority scheme by \nprioritizing claims of general unsecured creditors like the Trustee over claims of \npolicyholders. (See id. at 25-26, 3 7-3 8). \nCourts-including this Court-have relied on a state law's priority scheme \nin concluding that reverse preemption is applicable. For example, inln re PRS \nInsurance Group, Inc., both the Bankruptcy Court and this Court on appeal \nconcluded that reverse preemption warranted dismissal of a preference action \ncommenced by a bankruptcy trustee against an insolvent insurer in liquidation in \n17 Delaware. See In re PRS Ins. Grp., 294 B.R. at 612-13. Both Courts reached this \nconclusion because the trustee's affirmative attempt to recover funds would violate \nthe priorities of the Ohio insurance liquidation statute. See id. \nAccordingly, I turn to examine whether the Bankruptcy Court's exclusive \njurisdiction to determine whether the Disputed Funds are property of the estate \nmay invalidate, impair, or supersede the Texas Insurance Law provisions cited by \nRRC.4 \nC. The Bankruptcy Court's Exclusive Jurisdiction to Determine \nWhether Disputed Funds Are Property of the Estate Is Not \nReverse Preempted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act \n1. Texas Insurance Code\u00a7\u00a7 443.00S(c) and (d)-Jurisdictional \nStatute \nRRC argues that a conflict between state and federal jurisdictional statutes \nconstitutes grounds for reverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act: \nOne conflict between the Bankruptcy Code and the Texas \nInsurance Code is that the Texas Insurance Code vests \nthe Texas Court with exclusive jurisdiction over all \nproperty of the insurer, wherever located. Tex. Ins. \nCode\u00a7 443.005(c) and (d). Conversely, the Bankruptcy \nCode vests jurisdiction in the Bankruptcy Court to \nlitigate these matters. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. \n4 These issues were raised in the Bankruptcy Court, and affirmance is warranted on \nany basis that finds support in the record. In re LMI Legacy Holdings, Inc. 625 \nB.R. 268, 289-90 (D. Del. 2020) ( citing Geness v. Cox, 902 F .3d 344, 356 (3d Cir. \n2018)). \n18 (D.I. 10 at 27) ( emphasis added). As the Trustee points out, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334 is \nthe statutory basis for jurisdiction over the bankruptcy estate, while 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n157 authorizes district courts to refer bankruptcy proceedings, including \"matters \nconcerning the administration of the estate,\" to the bankruptcy courts. Under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1334(e)(l), the Bankruptcy Court has exclusive jurisdiction over property \nof the bankruptcy estate: \n( e) The district court in which a case under title 11 is \ncommenced or is pending shall have exclusive \njurisdiction-\n( 1) of all the property, wherever located, of the debtor as \nof the commencement of such case, and of property of \nthe estate ... \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(e)(l) (emphasis added). I agree the state and federal \njurisdictional statutes present no conflict: the Texas Court has jurisdiction over \nproperty of the receivership estate, and the Bankruptcy Court has jurisdiction over \nproperty of the bankruptcy estates. \nIndeed, it is well-established that the federal courts' exclusive jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(e) \"includes jurisdiction to decide whether disputed \nproperty is, in fact, property of the estate.\" In re Washington Mut., Inc., 461 B.R. \n200,217 (Banlcr.

Del. 2008), as amended (June 17, 2008) (\"[A] determination of what is property \n19 of the estate and concurrently, of what is available for distribution to creditors of \nthat estate, is precisely the type of proceeding over which the bankruptcy court has \nexclusive jurisdiction.\") ( quoting In re Ascher, 128 B.R. 639, 643 (Bankr.

N.D. Ga. 2010)). \nIn denying the Lift Stay Motion, the Bankruptcy Court cited this Court's In \nre Patriot National, Inc. decision for the proposition that the McCarran-F erguson \nAct does not affect the jurisdictional analysis, and \"the federal court retains \njurisdiction to determine of [sic] the rights to the Disputed Funds, even if the \nDisputed Funds never become property of the Debtors' estates.\" Windhaven Top \nIns.

S.D.N.Y. 2015)). \n20 While RRC is able to cite a few cases5 that are inconsistent with the \nBankruptcy Court's decision, these decisions are from outside the Third Circuit. \nThe Bankruptcy Court's decision is consistent with \"a long line of cases hold[ing] \nthat a bankruptcy court's retention of and potential exercise of, exclusive \njurisdiction over determinations related to property of the estate does not support \nreverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\" In re Patriot Nat 'l, Inc., \n623 B.R. at 709-10 (citing Ames, 542 B.R. at 151); In re Agway, Inc., 357 B.R. \n195, 203-04 (Bankr.

Care Mgmt. Co., 361 B.R. 863,866 \n(Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 2003) (reverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act \nconstituted grounds for relief from the automatic stay to allow commissioner of \ninsurance to continue pre-petition avoidance action against the debtor)); id. at 35-\n36 (citing Advanced Cellular Systems, Inc. v.

Cal. 2002) \n(McCarran-Ferguson Act reverse-preemption barred bankruptcy court from \ninterpreting tax allocation agreement to determine ownership of tax refund). \n21 RRC further argues that the Bankruptcy Court's reliance on In re Pa'triot \nNational, Inc. was misplaced because the Trustee is seeking something more than a \ndetermination of what is and is not property of the bankruptcy estates. According \nto RRC: \nThe Bankruptcy Court will not simply be asked to make \na determination of whether the disputed funds constitute \nproperty of the bankruptcy estate. [RRC] respectfully \nsubmits that question is without reasonable dispute. The \nfunds are collected premiums, funds which are held in \ntrust for the benefit of WNIC under the terms of the \nMGA Agreements and the Texas Insurance Code. The \nfunds are-indisputably-property of the WNIC estate. \nThe trustee has a claim against the WNIC estate for \nunpaid pre-petition commissions. That fact is also not \nreally in dispute. The gravamen of the dispute between \nthe parties is whether the trustee can recover on account \nof his claim against the funds he presently holds in trust \nfor the benefit of WNIC. In other words, what needs to \nbe adjudicated is the trustee's affirmative claim for \nrecovery of commissions owed to the MGAs and the \ndisposition of the funds which are, at present, \nreceivership property. \n(D.1. 10 at 32-33). RRC appears not so much concerned with demonstrating that \nfederal jurisdictional statute would invalidate, impair, or supersede the Texas \njurisdictional statute; rather, RRC is concerned that there is no federal jurisdiction \nat all, because \"[a]ll of the subject funds are property of the WNIC estate.\" Id. I \ndisagree. There is a genuine dispute regarding ownership of the disputed funds, \nand the Bankruptcy Court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether those \ndisputed funds are property of the estate. \n22 I conclude that Texas Insurance Code\u00a7 443.00S(c) and (d) are not \ninvalidated, impaired, or superseded by the Bankruptcy Court's exercise of its \nexclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the Disputed Funds are property of the \nDebtors' estates. 6 \n2. Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 443.209 -Anti-Setoff Statute \nAccording to RRC, \"the Bankruptcy Court simply ignored that the very \nessence of the dispute between the parties centers around Texas Insurance Code \n\u00a7 443 .209,\" which governs rights of setoff in Texas insurance liquidation \nproceedings. (D.I. 10 at 24). Section 443.209 provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] \nsetoff may not be allowed in favor of any person if ... the obligation of the person \nis as a trustee or a fiduciary ... \" Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.209. The Texas Insurance \nCode does not define \"setoff,\" but does include the term within its definition of \n\"transfer.\" Tex. Ins. Code \u00a7 443.004. \"Setoff is a contractual or equitable right \nthat 'allows entities that owe each other money to apply their mutual debts against \neach other, thereby avoiding the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A.' \" \n6 Because the present dispute did not involve property of the receivership estate or \nactions against WNIC itself, RRC's arguments regarding the automatic stay and \nstate court injunctions are also misplaced. (See D.I. 10 at 8 ( citing TRO \nprohibiting various actions \"against Defendant [WNIC] or Defendant's \nProperty.\"); id. at 9 (citing Tex. Ins. Code\u00a7 443.008, which imposes stay of \n\"actions against WNIC\" and \"actions against WNIC's property\"); id. (citing \nLiquidation Order, vesting RRC \"with title to all of [WNIC's] property ... \")). \n23 In re Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 596 B.R. 9, 14 (Banlcr. D. Del. 2018) (quoting \nCitizens Bank of Marylandv. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 18 (1995)) (internal citation \nand quotation marks omitted). In other words, the effect of a setoff is to reduce the \namount of an otherwise legally enforceable debt by an amount equal to another \nlegally enforceable debt. \nThe Trustee argues that he is not attempting to reduce the amount of any \nlawful debt owing to WNIC, and is therefore not asserting a right of setoff. \nAccording to Trustee, under the terms of the MGA Agreements, the MGAs \ncollected premiums on WNIC policies, and were obligated to \"remit the balance of \nthe accounts (premium minus commissions, losses and loss adjustment expenses), \nplus fronting fees and premium truces ... \" to WNIC on a periodic basis. (MGA \nAgreement, \u00a75.2, Appendix, A050 and A074). The MGA Agreements provide that \nWNIC was only entitled to premiums net of commissions, and the Trustee argues \nthis net amount was therefore the \"debt\" that was owed to WNIC. \nRRC disagrees with the Trustee's characterization, arguing that the dispute \nindeed concerns the Trustee's asserted right of setoff-as expressly noted in the \nOpinion. In re Windhaven, 636 B.R. at 601 (\"The Trustee, however, asserts a right \nof setoff and refuses to tum the Disputed Funds over to the RRC. \") \nRRC's substantive argument is well taken. The primary dispute between the \nTrustee and RRC is whether the Truste~ can recover on account of his claim by \n24 setting off against the escrow funds he holds, or whether all of the funds must be \nturned over to WNIC for distribution to all creditors in accordance with the Texas \nInsurance Code's priority scheme. While the Texas Insurance Code generally \npermits a person to setoff debits and credits against an insurer in liquidation, it \nforbids setoff ifthe funds are held in a fiduciary capacity. (A026-27; Tex. Ins. \nCode \u00a7 443 .209). Any resolution of the parties' disputes must include \nconsideration of\u00a7 443.209, as the statute may be \"dispositive, insofar as it \noverrides the pre-liquidation contractual right of setoff' on which the Trustee's \nposition relies. (D.I. 10 at 2). \nRRC's substantive argument, however, is not before the Court, and the \nBankruptcy Court's exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the Disputed \nFunds constitute property of the estate does not itself invalidate, impair, or \nsupersede the anti-setoffprovision. Rather, the Bankruptcy Court is well\u00ad\npositioned to make a determination as to whether the Disputed Funds are property \nof the Debtors' estates based on its interpretation of the MGA Agreements as well \nas the requirements of the Texas Insurance Code. See Lawski v. Frontier \nInsurance Group, LLC (In re Frontier Insurance Group, LLC), 517 B.R. 496, 506 \n(Ban1cr. S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\"a federal court's ordinary determination of property \nrights, interpretation of contracts, or interpretation of state statutes does not \n'impair' state law, even when a federal court's decision has a financial impact on \n\u00b7 25 the insolvent insurer's estate.\") (quoting In re First Assured Warranty Corp., 383 \nB.R. at 541); see also In re Ames Dep't Stores, Inc., 542 B.R. at 150 n.126 (same). \nThe Opinion itself states as much. See In re Windhaven, 636 B.R. at 604 (\"As a \nresult, this Court is not reverse pre-empted from determining whether the Disputed \nFunds are part of the estate, because at its base the Court will be interpreting the \nMGA Agreements (even though various provisions of the MGA Agreements are \nmandated by the Texas Insurance Code).\"). \nI conclude therefore that Texas Insurance Code\u00a7 443.209 is not invalidated, \nimpaired, or superseded by the Bankruptcy Court's exercise of its exclusive \njurisdiction to determine property of the Debtors' estates. \n3. Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 443.301 -Claim Priority Statute \nRR.C also points to Texas Insurance Code\u00a7 443.301, the statute that \nestablishes the priorities afforded different types of claims in Texas insurance \nliquidation proceedings, as grounds for reverse preemption. (D.I. 10 at 25-26). \nThe Texas Insurance Code's priority scheme prioritizes claims of policyholders \nover claims of general unsecured creditors (like the Trustee). Allowing the Trustee \nto effect a setoff to collect on his claim, RRC argues, \"would run contrary to the \nTexas Insurance Code's priority scheme.\" (Id. at 26). \nI agree that permitting an improper setoff has the potential to affect how \nreceivership property is administered and could upset the priority scheme set forth \n26 in the Texas Insurance Code. But as discussed above, the exercise of the \nBankruptcy Court's exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the Disputed \nFunds constitute property of the estate does not itself invalidate, impair, or \nsupersede the anti-setoff provision, and the Bankruptcy Court is well positioned to \ninterpret and apply the Texas Insurance Code in making that determination. lfno \nimproper setoff is permitted, the Texas Insurance Code's priority scheme remains \nunaffected. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn sum, the only substantive dispute is whether the Disputed Funds are \nproperty of the Debtors' estates-a substantive dispute that is not at issue in this \nappeal. The issue on appeal is whether the Bankruptcy Court correctly held that \nthere were no grounds for reverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. \nThe Texas statutes related to jurisdiction, setoff, and priorities of claims do not \nconflict with the Texas Insurance Code. Because the Bankruptcy Court correctly \nanalyzed the applicability of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, it also correctly \ndetermined that RRC had failed to establish cause for relief from the automatic \nstay.7 \n7 According to RRC, \"[t]he sole issue on appeal is whether the Bankruptcy Court \nerred by concluding that the [McCarran-Ferguson Act] was not implicated by the \ndisputes between the parties.\" (D.1. 10 at 4). As RRC does not allege any other \nerrors, it appears that RRC concedes that, absent reverse preemption under the \n27 The Court will issue a separate Order consistent with this Opinion. \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act, there was no error in the Bankruptcy Court's refusal to \ngrant relief from the automatic stay. \n28 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nIN RE: WINDHA VEN TOP INSURANCE \nHOLDINGS, LLC, et al., \nDebtors. \nRISK & REGULATORY CONSULTING , \nLLC, in its capacity as SPECIAL DEPUTY \nRECEIVER OF WINDHA VEN NATIONAL: \nINSURANCE COMPANY \nAppellant, \nV. \nAT ALAYA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, \net al., \nAppellees. \nORDER Chapter 7 \nBankr.
