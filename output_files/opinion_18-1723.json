No. 18-1723-LPS\nTOVAR QUINTERO, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nBrandon Troy Showell, Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\u2018Let\n\nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge:\nas INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Brandon Troy Showell (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), an inmate at Sussex Correctional Institution\n(\u201cSCT\u201d) in Georgetown, Delaware, commenced this action on November 1, 2018, pursuant to 42\nUSS.C. \u00a7 1983.' (D.I. 1) Plaintiff appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma\npauperis. (D.I. 11) On October 25, 2019, the Court consolidated Civ. No. 18-1723-LPS with Civ.\nNo. 19-624-LPS, with Civ. No. 18-1723-LPS as the lead case. The operative pleading filed in Civil\nAction No. 18-1723-LPS at D.I. 1 and D.I. 8 and the Complaint filed in Civil Action No. 19-624-\nLPS at D.I. 1, together, stand as the Complaint in this consolidated action. The matter was stayed\non September 30, 2019 due to Plaintiffs related criminal matter. Plaintiff moves to lift the stay,\nrequests counsel, and seeks leave to amend. (D.I. 17, 19, 20, 25, 26) The Court proceeds to review\nand screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff was arrested on June 5, 2018 following an altercation with Defendant, Delaware\nState Police Trooper Tovar-Quintero (\u201cTovar\u201d), that resulted in Plaintiff's arrest and several criminal\ncharges, including possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony; assault 2d\ninjuring a law enforcement officer; and resisting arrest with force or violence that injures or struggles\nwith a peace officer causing injury. (D.I. 8 at 5) On October 25, 2019, Plaintiff pled guilty to assault\n\n2d, reckless endangerment, and resisting arrest. (D.I. 16)\n\n' When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a\nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\nPlaintiff alleges that during the altercation, he was tased by Tovar, who had jumped onto the\nrunning board of Plaintiff's moving vehicle, and that the tasing left him incompetent to control the\nvehicle while it accelerated down the road. (Civ. No. 18-1723-LPS D.I. 1 at 5; D.I. 8 at 6, 7; Civ.\nNo. 19-624-LPS D.I. 1 at 7-8) Plaintiff alleges that after the vehicle stopped, Tovar hopped off the\nrunning board and tased him a second time, removed the taser prongs, and tased Plaintiff a third\ntime under his left breast. (Civ. No. 19-624-LPS D.I. 1 at 8) Plaintiff concluded that Tovar\u2019s motive\nwas beyond arresting him, and he exited the vehicle and ran with Tovar in pursuit. (Id) Plaintiffs\nsister saw what was happening and told Plaintiff to stop running because Tovar was trying to shoot\nPlaintiff. (Id) At that point, Plaintiff laid on the ground and was cuffed. (Id) Plaintiff alleges that\nonce cuffed, Tovar sat on Plaintiffs back with his \u201cknee and his weight\u201d while he tadioed officers to\nthe scene. (Id) Plaintiff alleges that Tovar \u201crecklessly engaged in his use of force.\u201d (D.I. 8 at 7)\n\nPlaintiff struggled to breathe, told Tovar that he had been diagnosed with \u201cheart\ncomplications,\u201d and that he \u201cwas in serious need of medical attention.\u201d (Civ. No. 18-1723 D.L 1 at\n5; Civ. No. 19-624-LPS D.I. 1 at 8) Plaintiff alleges that Tovar ignored his pleas for medical\nattention and handed him over to Defendant State Police Trooper Perry (\u201cPerry\u201d), who transported\nPlaintiff to Delaware State Police Troop 5 headquarters. (D.I. 1 at 5-6) Plaintiff alleges that on the\nway there, he passed out, later regaining consciousness upon arrival at Troop 5. (Id at 6) Plaintiff\nalleges that neither Tovar nor Perry made any attempt to summon or provide medical care. (Id. at 7)\nPlaintiff was transported to SCI? (Id. at 6) Plaintiff alleges that Tovar, Perry, and Defendant\nDetective Simpson denied him medical cate in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n(Id. at 5)\n\n? There are no allegations that Plaintiff was provided medical care at SCI.\n2\nAfter the incident, Tovar was taken to the local hospital for treatment for injures he allegedly\nsuffered. (Id. D.I. 8 at 5) Plaintiff alleges that Tovar reported he was injured when his arm was\n\u201cstuck in the steering wheel being dragged down the roadway\u201d of a vehicle driven by Plaintiff. (Id)\nPlaintiff alleges that medical records do not support Tovar\u2019s claim of injures and that Tovar perjured\nhimself to establish probable cause for Plaintiff's arrest. (Id. at 6) Plaintiff raises claims of false\narrest, excessive force, and supervisory liability against Tovar, Perry, and Simpson. (Id. at 9)\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory damages and relief from incarceration.\n\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetaty relief from a defendant who is immune from\nsuch relief.\u201d Ball \u00bb, Famigho, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma\npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Philips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\nEnickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally\nconstrued and the operative pleading, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent\nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley v.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 3d\n\nCir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal\ntheory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenatio.\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957\nF.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell \u00bb. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitrke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) Gi) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(6)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a\nplaintiff leave to amend his Complaint, unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See\nGrayson, 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Ath Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nUSS. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do\nmore than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a\ncause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Wilkams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306,\n315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft \u00bb. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).\nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See\nJobnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect\n\nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency\nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume\ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. See\nConnelly v, Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Igbal, 556 U.S. at 679\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task\nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id\nIv. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Immunity\n\nDelaware State Police Troop 4 and Troop 5 (\u201cState Police Troop 4 and 5\u201d) is a named\nDefendant. The Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution protects an unconsenting\nstate or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of the\nrelief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Pennburst State Sch. & Hosp. v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). State Police Troop 4 and\n5 fall under the umbrella of the Delaware State Police, an agency of the State of Delaware. See\nJanowksi v. Division of State Police Dep't of Safety \u00a2\u00bb Homeland Sec., 2009 WL 537051, at *2 (Del. Super.\nFeb. 27, 2009). Accordingly, it is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. See, \u00a2g., Jones\nv, Crisis Intervention Services, 239 F. Supp. 3d 795, 799 (D. Del.), aff'd, 686 F. App\u2019x 81 (3d Cir.),\n(Delaware State Police immune from suit in civil rights action); Lovett \u00bb. Pietlock, 2011 WL 2086642,\nat *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 26, 2011), afd, 32 A.3d 988 (Del. 2011) (action may not be maintained\nbecause Delaware State Police holds sovereign immunity as agency of the State and because\n\n5\nDelaware has not waived immunity). Further, a state agency, such as the Delaware State Police, \u201cis\nnot a person\u201d subject to claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S.\n58, 71 (1989).\n\nState Police Troop 4 and 5 will be dismissed as a defendant.\n\nB. Respondeat Superior/Petsonal Involvement\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Detective Simpson prepared a police report.\u2019 Liability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1983 action is personal in nature; to be liable, a defendant must have been personally involved in the\nwrongful conduct. In other words, a defendant is \u201cliable only for [his] own unconstitutional\nconduct.\u201d Barkes \u00bb. First Corr. Med., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir. 2014), rev'd on other grounds sub\nnom., Taylor v. Barkes, 575 U.S. 822 2042 (2015). The allegations against Simpson do not rise to the\nlevel of a constitutional violation. In addition, to the extent Simpson is named as a defendant under\na theory of respondeat superior, it is well established that there is no respondeat superior liability\nunder \u00a7 1983. See Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). Therefore, Simpson will be\ndismissed as a defendant.\n\nCc. False Artest\n\nPlaintiff raises claims of false arrest against Tovar, Perry, and Simpson. In Heck v. Humphrey,\nthe Supreme Court held that where success in a \u00a7 1983 action would implicitly call into question the\nvalidity of conviction or duration of sentence, a plaintiff must first achieve favorable termination of\nhis available state or federal habeas remedies to challenge the underlying conviction or sentence. See\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-487 (1994). Plaintiff's claim rests upon allegations that he was\nwrongfully arrested, resulting in criminal charges and his guilty plea. The claim clearly implicates the\n\nvalidity of Plaintiff's conviction and is barred by Heck. See Fields \u00bb. Venable, 674 F. App\u2019x 225, 229\n\n3 Plaintiff also alleges that Perry prepared a report. This is not a constitutional violation.\n6\n(3d Cir. 2016) (finding Heck barred Fourth Amendment claim that plaintiffs rights were violated by\nimproperly issued arrest warrant and illegal search upon his arrest); Eddington v. Cortes, 532 F. App\u2019x\n53, 56 (3d Cir. 2013) (determining Heck barred claim because it was clear that finding in plaintiffs\nfavor on false atrest/unconstitutional search claim would imply invalidity of his conviction on drug\nrelated charges); James v. York Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, 160 F. App\u2019x 126, 133-34 (3d Cir. 2005) (holding Heck\nbarred \u00a7 1983 claim of unlawful search and seizure where \u201carrest and conviction were based on the\nevidence gathered\u201d in allegedly illegal search and seizure).\n\nPlaintiffs wrongful arrest claim is barred by Heck and will be dismissed.\n\nD. Excessive Force and Medical Claims\n\nPlaintiff has alleged what appears to be a cognizable and non-frivolous excessive force claim\nagainst Tovar and a cognizable and non-frivolous deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\nclaims against Tovar and Perry. Plaintiff will be allowed to proceed with these claims.\nVv. MISCELLANEOUS MOTIONS\n\nA. Motions to Lift Stay\n\nPlaintiff's motions to lift the stay will be granted, as Plaintiff's criminal matter has been\nconcluded. (Consolidated Case at D.I. 17, 19, 25, 26)\n\nB. Request for Counsel\n\nPlaintiff renews his request for counsel, see D.I. 6, due to his lack of knowledge of the law\nand on the grounds that his criminal matter has concluded. (D.I. 6, 17, 19, 25) A pm se litigant\nptoceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory right to representation by counsel.\nSee Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cit. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir.\n1993). However, representation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances, after a\nfinding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. See Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.\n\n7\nAfter passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of factors when\nassessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in deciding whether to request a\nlawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the metits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the\nplaintiff's ability to present his or her case considering his or her education, literacy, experience, and\nthe restraints placed upon him or her by incarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the\ndegree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such\ninvestigation; (5) the plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and (6) the\ndegree to which the case tums on credibility determinations or expert testimony. See Montgomery v.\nPinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-56. The list is not exhaustive, nor\nis any one factor determinative. See Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.\n\nAssuming, solely for the purpose of deciding this motion, that Plaintiff's claims have merit in\nfact and law, several of the Tabron factors militate against granting his request for counsel. To date,\nthe filings demonstrate Plaintiff's ability to articulate his claims and represent himself. In addition,\nthe issues are not complex. For these reasons, this Court will deny Plaintiff's requests for counsel\nwithout prejudice to renew.\n\nCc. Motion to Amend\n\nPlaintiff moves to amend to add due process claims of fabricated evidence and prosecutorial\nmisconduct/malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. (D.I. 20) Pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(@)(2), courts \u201cshould freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u201d\nHowever, \u201cundue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, prejudice, [or] futility\u201d could all \u201cjustify a denial\nof leave to amend.\u201d Shane v. Fauver, 213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2000). \u201cFutility\u201d means that the\ncomplaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted\u201d under the\nstandard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Lejon-Twin E/ v. Marino, 722 F. App\u2019x 262, 265\n\n8\n(3d Cir. 2018). In evaluating whether a plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief could be\ngtanted, the court accepts \u201call factual allegations as true, construes the complaint in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, and determines whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint,\nthe plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\u201d Bronowicz v. Allegheny Cty., 804 F.3d 338, 344 (3d Cir. 2015)\n(internal quotation mark omitted).\n\nPlaintiff pled guilty to criminal charges brought against him and, therefore, the proposed\nmalicious prosecution claim fails as a matter of law since the ctiminal matter did not end in his\nfavor. See Halsey v. Pfeiffer, 750 F.3d 273, 296-97 (3d Cir. 2014) (\u201cTo prevail on a Fourth Amendment\nmalicious prosecution claim under section 1983, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) the defendant\ninitiated a criminal proceeding; (2) the criminal proceeding ended in [the plaintiff's] favor; (3) the\ndefendant initiated the proceeding without probable cause; (4) the defendant acted maliciously or for\na purpose other than bringing the plaintiff to justice; and (5) the plaintiff suffered deprivation of\nliberty consistent with the concept of seizure as a consequence of a legal proceeding.\u201d). see also\nWalker v. Clearfield Cty. Dist. Attorney, 413 F. App\u2019x 481, 483 (3d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[A] guilty plea . . . does\nnot permit a later assertion of no probable cause.\u201d); Donahue v. Gavin, 280 F.3d 371, 383 (3d Cir.\n2002) (malicious prosecution claims require that underlying criminal proceedings were terminated in\nmanner signifying innocence of accused).\n\nIn addition, similar to the unlawful arrest claim dismissed above, Plaintiff's proposed\nfabricated evidence and prosecutorial misconduct claims are barred by Heck, as the proposed claims\nnecessarily call into question the validity of his conviction. Sve, \u00a2.g., Abella v. Rubino, 63 F.3d 1063,\n1064, 1065 (11th Cir. 1995) (holding that plaintiff's argument that defendants \u201cknowingly and\nwillfully conspired to convict him falsely by fabricating testimony and other evidence against him\u201d\nwas barred under Heck because \u201c[jJudgment in favor of [plaintiff] on these claims [that the\n\n9\ndefendants unconstitutionally conspired to convict him of crimes he did not commit] would\nnecessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction (internal quotation marks omitted)\u201d); Perez v. Sifel,\n57 F.3d 503 (7th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (Heck barred \u00a7 1983 action charging conspiracy to procure\nconviction through perjury, falsifying evidence, and withholding exculpatory evidence); Hennessey v.\nAtlantic Cty. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, 2006 WL 2711510, at *6 n.7 (D.NJ. Sept. 18, 2006) (any claim for\ndamages in \u00a7 1983 action alleging prosecutorial misconduct would not be actionable pursuant to\nHeck until judgment of conviction is invalidated).\n\nThe Court has reviewed the proposed amendments and finds amendment is futile.\nTherefore, the motion to amend will be denied. (DI. 20)\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Coutt will: (1) grant Plaintiffs motions to lift the stay (D.L 17,\n19, 25, 26); (2) deny without prejudice to renew Plaintiff's requests for counsel (D.I. 17, 19, 25); (3)\ndeny Plaintiff's motion to amend (D.I. 20); (4) allow Plaintiff to proceed against Tovar on the\nexcessive force claim and against Tovar and Perry on the medical needs claims; and (5) dismiss\nDefendants Charles Simpson and Delaware State Troop 4 and 5 and the remaining claims as legally\nfrivolous and based upon immunity from suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (iii) and \u00a7\n1915A(b)(1) and (2).\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n10\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nBRANDON TROY SHOWELL,\nPlaintiff, :\n: CONSOLIDATED\nv. : Civ. No. 18-1723-LPS\nTOVAR QUINTERO, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this 28th day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1.

Plaintiff may proceed against Trooper Tovar Quintero on what appeats to be a\ncognizable and non-frivolous excessive force claim and against Tovar Quintero and Trooper Perry\non cognizable and non-frivolous deliberate indifference to serious medical needs claims.\n\n5. Defendants Charles Simpson and Delaware State Troop 4 and 5 and the remaining\nclaims are DISMISSED as legally frivolous and based upon immunity from suit pursuant to 28\nUS.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)@ and (iii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and (2).\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:\n\nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(3) and (d)(1), Plaintiff shall complete and return to the Clerk\nof Court original \u201cU.S. Marshal-285\u201d forms for Defendants Tovar Quintero and Trooper Perry, as\nwell as for the Attorney General of the State of Delaware, 820 N. FRENCH STREET,\n\n1\nWILMINGTON, DELAWARE, 19801, pursuant to 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3103(c). Plaintiff shall also\nprovide the Court with copies of the Complaint that consists of Civil Action No. 18-1723-LPS at\nD.I. 1 and DI. 8 and Civil Action No. 19-624-LPS at D.I. 1, for service upon each defendant and\nthe attorney general. Plaintiff is notified that the United States Marshals Service (\u201cUSMS\u201d) will not\nserve the Complaint until all \u201cU.S. Marshal 285\u201d forms and copies of the Complaint have been\nreceived by the Clerk of Court. Failure to provide complete \u201cU.S. Marshal 285\u201d forms and copies of\nthe Complaint for each defendant and the attorney general within 90 days of this order may result in\nthe matter being dismissed or Defendants being dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 4(m).\n\n2. Upon receipt of the form(s) required by paragraph 1 above, the USMS shall\nforthwith serve a copy of the Complaint (Civil Action No. 18-1723-LPS at D.I. 1 and D.I. 8 and\nCivil Action No. 19-624-LPS at D.L. 1), this order, a \u201cNotice of Lawsuit\u201d form, the filing fee\norder(s), and a \u201cReturn of Waiver\u201d form upon each defendant so identified in each 285 form.\n\n3.

R.\nCiv. P. 4(d)(1), has thirty days from the date of mailing to return the executed waiver form. Such a\ndefendant then has sixty days from the date of mailing to file its response to the complaint, pursuant\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3). A defendant residing outside this jurisdiction has an additional thirty days\nto return the waiver form and to respond to the complaint.\n\n4.
