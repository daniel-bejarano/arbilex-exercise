No. 20- cr-66 (MN)  \n \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM O RDER \n \nAt Wilming ton, this 6th  day of May 2022;  \nOn October 1 , 2021, Defendant Carnell Roberts (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cRoberts\u201d ) submitted a \nMotion to Suppress Evidence .  (D.I. 30).  The Government responded on October  20, 2021.  \n(D.I.  31).  On March 2 , 2022, t he Court conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding the issues \nraised .  (D.I. 38).  After the hearing, the parties submitted additional briefs.  (D.I. 39, 40, 41 ).  The \nCourt has reviewed all  the filings , the evidence submitted , and the arguments presented.  For the \nreasons set forth in this opinion, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress is DENIED. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT  \nAt the evidentiary hearing held on March 2, 2022, the government called one witness, \nOffice r Daniel Collins (\u201cCollins\u201d), and the Defendant called  one witness , Erin Roosevelt  \n(\u201cRoosevel t\u201d), an assistant manager of Cabela\u2019s, an outdoor recreation- oriented retail store.  The  \nCourt found both witnesses to be credible.  The  following represents the C ourt\u2019s essential findings \nof fact as required by Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  \n1. Officer Collins is a probation officer who has been employed by the Delaware \nDepartment of Corrections for sixteen years.  (Tr. 3:7\u201312).1  For roughly eleven years, Officer \n \n1  The Transcript referred to here and throughout this opinion may be found at D.I. 38.  2 Collins has been assigned to Operation Safe Streets Task Force, a joint task force that involves \ntraditional police methods of patrol as well as monitoring probationers.  (Tr. 3:13\u201321).   \n2. In July 2020, Collins conducted a motor vehicle stop and found cocaine in the \ndriver\u2019s  vehicle.  (Tr. 4:2 \u20138).  Collins placed that individual under arrest, took him  back to the \npolice station, and told  him that the state would not proceed with charges if he  agreed to provide \ninformation to the state .  (Tr. 4:18\u20135:17).  T he individual was on probation, but Collins did not \nknow of and had no prior interactions with him .  (Tr. 5:18\u201320; 30:14\u201320).  The individual  accepted \nCollins\u2019s offer and agreed to become a confidential informant  (\u201cCI\u201d)  to hel p himself out .   \n3. At the police station, the CI provided the officers with information about two \nindividuals .  First, the CI relayed information about an individual who is not the defendant in this \ncase who \u201cwas always coming in the area with a gun and shooting people . . . and causing a ruckus.\u201d  \n(Tr. 6:7\u201314).  Though the CI did not know the individual \u2019s name, he knew his nickname and the \narea he frequented.  Collins entered that information in a nickname database, found a hit, and \nconducted a photo array to determine whether  the CI was able to identify the individual whose \nnickname was a hit in the database.  (Tr. 6:14\u201317).  The CI correctly identified the individual  and \nthe individual  had several warrants out for his ar rest.  (Tr. 6:17\u201320).   \n4. Later that day, the CI saw th e individual in question in the CI\u2019s neighborhood and \ncalled Collins to alert him about the individual\u2019s presence.  This prompted Collins and other officers to go to the area to arrest the individual for his outstanding warrants.  (Tr. 7:4\u201317).  After a foot chase, officers arrested the individual and his friend, each of whom  possessed  firearms .  \n(Tr. 7:17\u201321).  Both individuals ended up either pleading or being convicted of a firearm  violation  \nin Superior Court or  Family Court.  (Tr. 7:22\u201325).    3 5. The second piece of information provided by the CI concerned Defendant  Roberts.  \nAs with the first individu al, the CI did not know Roberts\u2019 name, and instead reported that he had \nseen an individual  who was  living  in the  800 block of West 7th Street, who wore an ankle monitor  \nand was  on probation, carrying a firearm several times .  (Tr.  8:8\u201317).   \n6. Collins used t he probation system to search for probationers living on 7th Street \nand found Defendant, a Level 2 probationer who wore an ankle monitor.  (Tr. 8:18\u20139:4).  Collins \nthen produced a photo array comprising four or five pictures and showed it to the CI to see if he \ncould identify Roberts.  The CI positively identif ied the Defendant.  (Tr. 9:5\u201311, 9:18\u201325).  Days \nlater, Collins called the CI again to \u201creconfirm\u201d w hat the CI had first reported, and the CI\u2019s report \nabout Roberts remained consistent.  ( Tr. 10:8\u201322) .   \n7. At the relevant time, Roberts was on probation.  (Gov\u2019t Exhibit 1).  As a condition \nof his probation, Roberts consented to and understood that he is subject to a search of his living quarters, property, person, personal effects , and vehicle without a warrant at any time by a \nprobation officer.  ( See id.).  In addition, Roberts agreed to not possess or consume any non-\nprescribed controlled substance or dangerous drug, and to not own, possess, or be in control of any firearm or deadly weapon without the written approval of his supervising officer.  ( See id.).   \n8. After receiving the information from the CI, Collins began investigating Roberts.  \nCollins surveilled Roberts\u2019 residence several times by driving by it in an unmarked, but recognizable police vehicle.  When Collins drove by Roberts\u2019 house, he noticed that people on the street would quickly rush into Roberts\u2019 unlocked house.  (Tr. 11:18\u201312:5).  In Collins\u2019 experience, people entering unlocked doors to avoid police detection indicates nefarious behavior.  (Tr. 12:6\u20138; 14:5\u201315).  Collins observed this behavior  several times over two or three days, but never \nstopped, searched, or spoke to any of the individuals he saw outside of Roberts\u2019 house.  (Tr. 36:6\u20134 11).  Collins also knew the area to be a high- crime area and that Roberts had several felony \nconvictions for  drug- related and sex offenses.  (Tr. 15:4\u201319).   \n9. In addition, Collins used GPS monitoring of Roberts\u2019 ankle bracelet to track his \nlocation  and observed that Roberts was very recently at a Cabela\u2019s, a store that sells firearms and \nammunition a long with many other innocuous items, for forty- five minutes.  (Tr. 15:23\u201316:9).  \nRoberts\u2019 time at Cabela\u2019s \u201cwas a red flag\u201d to Collins because the CI reported that Roberts, a felon, \nwas carrying a gun, in addition to \u201ceverything else that [he] had witnessed.\u201d (Tr. 16: 9\u201310).2  \nRoberts did not attempt to obtain video surveillance from inside Cabela\u2019s to see what Roberts was \ndoing inside the store.  (Tr. 38:16\u201339:3).   \n10. On August 3, 2020, Collins contacted his supervisor, Supervisor Carlo Pini, to \nobtain an administrative  search warrant according to departmental procedure.  (Tr. 16:15\u201321; \n17:5\u20138).  Collins indicated that he \u201chad a past proven reliable informant giving [him] information about a [probationer] that may have a possession of a firearm, and the informant identif ied him by \npicture, by his residence, by the fact that he was on a GPS monitor.\u201d  Collins further reported that \nhe had conducted \u201cdrive -bys of the residence [and about] how people were in and out of the \nresidence several times.\u201d  Collins also indicated that \u201cthe GPS put [Roberts] inside a gun store a couple of days prior for an extended period of time.\u201d  (Tr. 17:18\u201318:2).  Collins and Pini filled out a verbal checklist to indicate the reasons that Collins wished to search Roberts\u2019 residence.  \n(Tr. 17:9\u201317).  On that checklist, Collins indicated that the offender is believed to possess \n \n2  The C ourt credits the testimony of Ms. Roosevelt that the Cabela \u2019s store is \u201can outdoor \nsporting store\u201d and not one that she would describe as primarily a gun store.  (Tr. at 61).  \nThere is no dispute, however, that Cabella\u2019s does sell guns in addition to other \nmerchandise.  5 contraband and that information from an informant is corroborated.  (Government Exhibit 2).  Pini \ngave Collins permission to search Roberts\u2019 residence.  (Tr. 18:3\u20135).  \n11. Several h ours after obtaining oral approval from his supervisor, Collins and several \nother officers went to search Roberts\u2019 residence.  (Tr. 22:11\u201320; 23:5\u201310).  The officers waited until Roberts arrived, and when he did, they detained him and entered the house bef ore explaining \nthat they were going to perform an administrative search to look for firearms or illegal narcotics in his residence.  (Tr. 23:11\u201324:6).   \n12. After Collins explained the reason for his visit, Roberts admitted that he had a .22 \ncaliber firearm un der a mattress.  (Tr. 27:6\u201316).  Collins then retrieved the firearm.  (Tr. 27:23\u2013\n28:7).  In the house, Collins also observed, in plain view, a white substance (that later tested \npositive for cocaine) in a bag that was tied in a manner consistent with how Col lins had seen other \nbagged drugs packaged.  (Tr. 25:17\u201326:23).  Further, upon entering the residence, Collins noticed \na strong odor of marijuana, and though he could not tell if he was smelling fresh or burnt marijuana, \nofficers discovered several pounds of marijuana in the residence.  (Tr. 24:7\u201325:2; 28:11\u201313; 46:21\u201347:8).  In addition to the marijuana, cocaine, and firearms, the officers found ecstasy pills, scales, baggies, a magazine for a .40 caliber firearm, a box of 9- millimeter ammunition, $3,000 in \nsuspected gun proceeds, and a safe.  (Tr. 28:8\u201321).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects \u201cthe right of the people \nto be secure against unreasonable  searches  and seizures  . . . .\u201d   U.S.  CONST . amend IV.   When a \nsearch is conducted without a warrant, the  government must demonstrate that the search was \nconducted pursuant to one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement.  See U nited States . v. \nHerrold , 962 F.2d 1131, 1137 (3d Cir. 1992).  Evidence obtained in an unconstitutional manner 6 will usually be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d  United States  v. Brown , 448 F.3d 239, \n244 ( 3d Cir. 2006) (citing Wong Sun v. U nited States , 371 U.S. 471, 487\u201388 (1963) ). \nProbation officers may search a probationer\u2019s residence based on reasonable suspicion that \nthe probationer is engaged in criminal activity therein.  United States  v. Knights , 534 U.S. 112, \n122 (2001).  Reasonable suspicion requires that \u201cthe detaining officers must have a particularized \nand objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d   United States  \nv. Cortez,  449 U.S. 411, 417\u201318 (1981).  The reasonable suspicion standard demands less than \nprobable cause but more than an inarticulable hunch.  See Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1967).   \nIn determining whether officers had reasonable suspicion, courts must review the totality \nof the circumstances.  United States v. Arvizu , 534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002).   Further, the reasonable  \nsuspicion inquiry is to be considered  from the vantage point of a \u201creasonable, trained officer \nstanding in [the detaining officer \u2019s] shoes.\u201d   Johnson v. Campbell , 332 F.3d 199, 206 (3d Cir. \n2003).  The question that must be posed is whether \u201cthe facts avai lable to the officer at the moment \nof the seizure or search warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was \nappropriate.\u201d  Terry , 392 U.S. at 21\u201322 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nRoberts moved to suppre ss the physical evidence seized from his  residence on or about \nAugust 3, 2021 on the grounds that the search and seizure was unlawful and in violation of his \nrights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  (D.I. 30).  Roberts argues that the state  lacked the necessary reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity which \nwould justify an administrative search of his residence, and therefore whatever found in his residence must be suppressed.  ( See D.I. 39, 41).  He contends that there was no reasonabl e \nsuspicion because the tipster was not sufficiently reliable and the government failed to corroborate 7 crucial aspects of the tip.  Specifically, Roberts argues that the fact that the CI was \u201ca recently \ndetained criminal  suspect who believed that he could receive leniency from prosecution if he \nprovided information implicating someone else in criminal activity  . . .  undermined the \ninformant\u2019s credibility.\u201d  (D.I. 41 at 2).  Moreover, Roberts contends that the tip itself \u201cla cked \nsufficient \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 as \u2018it provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant\u2019s knowledge or credibility.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. (quoting Florida v. \nJ.L., 529 U.S. 266, 271 (2000)).  The government justifies the search by claiming that it possessed \nthe requisite level of suspicion because it possessed a tip from a known, reliable informant and \nindependently corroborated certain aspects of that tip.  (See D.I. 40).   \nTo determine whether a tip is reliab le, the Court considers  whether : (1) the information \nwas provided to the police in a face -to-face interaction, allowing an officer to assess directly the \ninformant \u2019s credibility; (2) the informant can be held responsible if his  allegations are untrue;  \n(3) the information would not be available to the ordinary observer;  (4) the informant has recently \nwitnessed the criminal activity at issue; and  (5) the witness \u2019s information accurately predicts future \nactivity.   See United States  v. Johnson, 592 F.3d 442, 449 (3d Cir. 2010).  Because the reaso nable \nsuspicion inquiry analyzes the totality of the circumstances, no single factor is dispositive or necessary to render an informant\u2019s tip reliable.  See id.   Here, t he totality of the circumstances \nsuggest that the CI\u2019s tip was reliable.   \nFirst, Collins received information about Roberts  in a face- to-face interaction which \nallowed him to gauge the CI\u2019s credibility.  Although the specific length of the interaction was not stated, the interaction involved gathering information about another suspect in addition to about Roberts, and conducting a photo array to see if the CI could positively identify both individuals that the CI had provided information about.  During Collins\u2019  in-person discussion with the CI , 8 Collins  had ample time to ascertain  the in formant\u2019s reliability , and Collins deemed him to be \nreliable.  \nFurther, the  CI both had a strong incentive to provide truthful information and also could \nhave been held legally responsible if his allegations proved untrue.  After the CI was found with \ncocaine, he was told that if he provided information about others , the state would not proceed with \ncharges , but charges would issue if he  did not help.  Therefore, the CI had a n incentive to provide \nthe state with accurate information.  See United States v. Dennington, No. 1:07- cr-43-SJM- 1, 2009 \nWL 2591763, at *7 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 21, 2009) (noting that informant who \u201cprovided the relevant \ninformation during the pendency of his own criminal prosecution when he was in federal custody \n[] had every motivation to be helpful to law enforcement agents in order to obtain the best sentence \npossible.\u201d).  Indeed, if the CI\u2019s reports were false, the CI would be exposed to criminal liability.  \nSee 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1245(3) ; U.S. v. Bland, No. 08\u201337 \u2013JJF, 2008 WL 4450240, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. \n30, 2008) (observing that a known tipster\u2019s report was more likely to be reliable because the tipster \ncould be held criminally liable under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1245(3)  if his report was  false).  This factor \nweighs in favor of the CI\u2019s reliability.  \nThird, at least some of the  information provided by the CI is  not likely to be available to \nthe ordinary observer.  As explained above, the CI told Collins that an individual (later identified to be Roberts) was living on a particular block, wore an ankle monitor, was on probation, and had been seeing carrying a firearm to and from his residence several times .  It appears  to be  undisputed \nthat the information conveyed about the firearm w as not available to an ordinary observer.  It is \nnot, however, obvious that the information about the ankle monitor and probation would not be \navailable to the ordinary observer, since this could be gleaned simply by observing Roberts wearing shorts and sandals.  Nevertheless , because  at least some information that Roberts provided 9 would not be available to an ordinary observer, this factor provides some additional support in \nfavor of th e tip\u2019s reliability.  \nFactors four and five do not provide much, if anything, to bolster  the tip\u2019s re liability.  For \nfactor four, a lthough the CI reported seeing Roberts carrying a firearm, there is no indication in \nthe record when he saw Roberts with a firearm.  Factor five is also of little import in this case , as \nnone of the information Roberts relayed was predictive of future activity .  Nevertheless, viewing \nthese factors together, because the CI had a strong incentive to provide accurate information, provided information that would not be available to an ordinary observer, and was deemed to be \ncredible by an experienced officer who interacted with him face- to-face for an extended period of \ntime, a reasonable officer would view the CI\u2019s tip as being reliable.  \nMoreover, after  receiving the CI\u2019s initial tip about Roberts, two events occurred to bolster \nthe tip \u2019s reliability  in the opinion of a reasonable officer.   First, not only did the government know \nthat the CI\u2019s other tip resulted in an arrest of two individuals who at the time were carrying \nfirearms, but th e government also knew that the CI was instrumental in effectuating that arrest.  \nTherefore, at the time that officers performed their administrative search of Roberts\u2019 residence, the \nCI\u2019s reliability had been past proven.  See United States v. Cephas , 808 F. App\u2019x 122, 124 (3d Cir. \n2020) ( in concluding that the tip was reliable, noting that the \u201ctipster had provided credible \ninformation leading to at least one arrest .\u201d); United States v. Stearn, 597 F.3d 540, 557 (3d Cir. \n2010) (quoting Illinois v. Gates , 462 U.S. 213, 244 (1983)) ( \u201c[If] an informant is right about some \nthings, he is more probably right about other facts.\u201d ); U.S. v. Marino, 682 F.2d 449, 453 (3d \nCir.1982)  (internal citations omitted)  (\u201cIt is not necessary, moreover, that the  informant \u2019s tips have  \nled to convictions; a prior history of tips that result in  arrests  and in the securing of information \nand evidence can provide a sufficient basis for concluding that the information is  reliable\u201d) .  10 Second, Collins was able to corroborate certain pieces of information provided by the CI \nand performed further investigative work that revealed indications of criminal activity.  After \nreceiving information that a probationer who wore  an ankle monitor  and lived on a specific block \nwas seen carrying a firearm several times, Collins corroborated the information that a probationer wearing an ankle monitor was, in fact, living on that block.  Collins conducted a photo array to \nensure that the CI\u2019s report concerned Robe rts, and not some other individual.  Further, Collins \nused GPS location monitoring that indicated Roberts had recently visited a Cabela\u2019s, a store that \nsells firearms and ammunition  (among many other goods).  Last, Collins\u2019 drive -by surveillance of \nRoberts\u2019s residence raised  \u201ca red flag \u201d that something suspicious was happening at Roberts\u2019s \nhouse.  (Tr. 14:5\u201315).  Although none of the tips provided by the CI were predictive in nature,  \n\u201c[w]here initial suspicion arises not from officer observation but from an identifiable informant\u2019s \ntip, only minimal police  corroboration may be needed to justify an investigative stop.  Where the \ninformant is identified, his veracity, basis of knowledge , and track record of providing information \nmay suggest the tip\u2019s inherent reliability.\u201d  United States v. Nelson, 284 F.3d 472, 485 (3d Cir. 2002) (Ambro, J., dissenting) (explaining why a  tip from a  known informant  requires less \ncorroboration than an ano nymous tip in  a dissent insisting that the anonymous tip at issue  was not \nadequately corroborated in order to provide the officers reasonable suspicion) (emphasis in \noriginal). \nUltimately, the Court finds that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct an \nadministrative search of Roberts\u2019 residence.\n3  At the time they searched Roberts\u2019 residence, \n \n3  The Court is not persuaded by Defendant\u2019s contention that the state\u2019s failure to abide by \nDelaware Department of Corrections regulations governing the granting of administrative search warrants impact s the Court\u2019s analysis.  ( See D.I. 39 at 7\u20138).  As a preliminary matter, \nthe Court is not persuade d that the state deviated from a regulation requiring certain pre -\nsearch procedures.  See Delaware Department of Correction Bureau of Community 11 officers possessed information by a past -proven informant who discussed seeing Roberts carrying \na firearm on several occasions.  Several facets of the informant\u2019s tip were corroborated by \nindependent officer investigation.  Further, when officers surveilled Roberts\u2019s residence, t hey \nnoticed behavior that suggested suspicious activity.  Based on the t otality of circumstances, the \nCourt concludes that the state possessed the requisite reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct an administrative search at Roberts\u2019 residence.  \nOnce lawfully  in the house  to conduct an administrative search, the Court is satisfied that \nthe government conducted its search lawfully .  Once in the residence, the state had the right to \nsearch anywhere in Roberts\u2019 residence where evidence of Roberts\u2019s suspected probation violation could reasonably be found.  See United States v. Crews , No. CR 06- 418, 2009 WL 426646, at *6 \n(W.D. Pa. 2009) (\u201c [Officer] was conducting a lawful search of [probationers\u2019] residence based \nupon his reasonable suspicion that a probation violation had occurred.  The scope of this search \nincluded anywhere in the residence where contraband or evidence of the probation violation could \nreasonably be found.\u201d).  When Collins entered the house, he reported smelling a \u201cvery strong\u201d \nscent of marijuana , which gave rise to reasonable suspicion of another probat ion \nviolation   \u2013  possession of marijuana .  (Tr. 24:7\u201325: 10).  See United States v. Hutchinson, 417 F. \nSupp. 2d 497, 509 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 18, 2017)  (explaining that \u201cplain smell can provide probable \ncause to justify a search where an officer smells a substance that is immediately apparent to him \n \nCorrections Probation and Parole Procedure \u00a7 7.19.  Even if the  state had, however, the \nrelevant question for a motion to suppress is not what Delaware law requires, but \u201cwhat \nthe Fourth Amendment demands of the challenged search.\u201d  United States v. Henley 941 F.3d 646, 650 (3d Cir. 2019); See Virginia v. Moore , 553 U.S. 164 (2008) (finding that \nofficers did not vi olate the Fourth Amendment by arresting motorist who, under state law, \nshould not have been arrested).  As explained above, the Fourth Amendment require s only \nreasonable suspicion to enter Defendant\u2019s residence because he is a probationer who agreed to \u201ca search of [his] living quarters . . . without a warrant at any time by a probation/parole \nofficer.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 1).  The Court finds such grounds  present  here.  12 \nto be the odor of contraband.\u201d) .  Further,  after seating Roberts on a couch in his living room, \nCollins looked up and saw a knotted bag of a white substance sitting in plain view on the shelf of \nan open living room closet.  Collins\u2019 experience informed him that the bag was tied similarly to other bags t hat he has encountered in drug investigations.  (Tr. 25:11\u201326:23) .  And last, when \nCollins explained to Roberts that he was conducting an administrative search  and asked  whether \nRoberts had any firearms or drugs, Roberts confessed that there was a gun unde r a mattress.  The se \nevents gave the state a sufficient basis to search for drugs, firearms, and ammunition, and t he Court \ntherefore concludes that the state had a sufficient basis to seize the evidence it seized.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe state learned  from a confidential informant that a probationer  with an ankle monitor \nwho lived in a particular block was seen carrying a firearm on several occasions.  At the time the \nstate obtained an administrative warrant to search Roberts\u2019 residence, officers unders tood the \ninformant to be past -proven and reliable and had verified certain facets of his tip .  Once lawfully \nin the residence, the state conducted a valid administrative search .  THEREFORE, f or the \nforegoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY O RDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress  (D.I. 30) is \nDENIED . \n      \nThe Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  \n "}
