BURKE, United States Magistrate Judge  \n As announced at the hearing on October 24, 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nDefendant s Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Xenogenic Development Limited Liability \nCompany\u2019s motion to dismiss for l ack of s ubject matter j urisdiction  or, in the alternative, for the \nCourt to decline to exercise its declaratory judgment jurisdiction (the \u201cmotion\u201d), (D.I. 18), is DENIED.  \n Defendants\u2019 motion was fully briefed as of September 14, 2022.  (D.I. 27)  The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection with the motion, heard oral argument, and applied the relevant legal standard for review of this type of motion to dismiss.  The instant Memorandum Opinion and Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the October 24 hearing, pertinent excerpts of which follow: \n[T]his case, as the parties know, is Hewlett Packard Enterprise \nCompany v [.] Intellectual Ventures I, LLC, et al , [C]ivil [A]ction \n[No.] 22-730- GBW [-CJB] .  With its  [C]omplaint in the case, [] \n[P]laintiff [] Hewlett  Packard Enterprise Company, which I [ wi]ll \nrefer to  as [\u201cP] laintiff [\u201d] or [\u201c] HPE ,[\u201d] seeks a declaratory  \njudgment of non-infringement as to each of the five patents [-]in[-\n]suit. \n At issue before me now is [D] efendant [s] Intellectual Ventures I, \nLLC, or  [\u201c]IV,[\u201d] and Xenogenic Development Limited Liability  \nCompany[\u2019s] motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  \n The parties consented to the Court\u2019 s jurisdiction to resolve this \nmotion [,]\n1 and for reasons the Court will discuss now, I [ a]m going \nto order that the motion be denied. . . .   First, as I begin, let me set out the legal standards that apply to a motion to  dismiss of this type.  The motion is brought [] pursuant \n[to] [Federal R] ule of [C] ivil [P]rocedure 12(b)(1).   Under that \n[R]ule [,] the Court\u2019s jurisdiction may be challenged either \nfacially [\u2014]that is [,] based on the legal sufficiency of the claim [\u2014] \n \n1  (D.I. 25) \n \n3 \n or factually [\u2014]that is [,] based on the sufficiency of jurisdictional \nfact.2  Here [,] the parties agree that  [D]efendant [s\u2019] attack is a \nfacial challenge because it focuses on the purported insufficiency \nof the allegations in [P] laintiff \u2019s [C]omplaint.3  As a result, all the \nfacts that the  Court will reference herein are either drawn  from the \n[C]omplaint itself or from documents  attached to the [C]omplaint \nor integral thereto.  \n The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under the Declaratory \nJudgment Act if the facts alleged under all the circumstances  show \nthat there [ i]s a substantial controversy between parties having \nadverse legal interests  of sufficient immediacy and reality to \nwarrant  the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\n4 \n In patent cases, declaratory  judgment jurisdiction exists where a \npatentee asserts rights under a patent based on certain  identified \nongoing or planned activity of another party and where that party \ncontends that it has the right to engage in the accused activity without license.\n5 \n In light of this, the United States Court of Appeals for the [F] ederal \n[C]ircuit,  whose law applies here,\n6 has held that in declaratory \njudgment actions for non- infringement a plaintiff must show two  \nthings [:]  first, an affirmative act by the  patentee related to the \nenforcement of his patent rights; and second, meaningful preparation to conduct potentially infringing activity.\n7 \n The second prong of that test,  th[e] [\u201c]meaningful preparation[\u201d]  \nprong, is satisfied when a party has already engaged in the actual \n \n2  TSMC Tech. , Inc. v. Zond, LLC , Civil Action No. 14-721- LPS-CJB, 2014 WL \n7498398, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 8, 2014).    \n3  (D.I. 19 at 3; D.I. 22 at 7)   \n \n4  Hewlett -Packard Co. v. Acceleron LLC , 587 F.3d 1358, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009). \n \n5 Id. \n  \n6  See MedImmune, Inc. v. Centocor, Inc ., 409 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005), \noverruled on other grounds , MedImmune, Inc. v. Centocor, Inc., 549 U.S. 1163 (2007). \n \n7 Ass\u2019n for Molecular Pathology v.

Del. 2020) ( hereinafter \u201c Microsoft \u201d). \n 4 \n manufacture or sale of the potentially  infringing product or when \nthe party has meaningfully prepared to produce a potentially \ninfringing product.8 \n In this case [,] the parties agree that this [\u201c] meaningful \npreparation[\u201d]  prong is not at issue as to this motion since \n[P]laintiff \u2019s HP  Intelligent Edge Aruba products [at issue] in the \n[C]omplaint have been and are currently sold in the United States.\n9 \n What is at issue, however, is the first [\u201c]affirmative act[\u201d]  prong of \nthe test.  The  Court will take up this prong in more detail in just a \nfew moments.  Before it does, though, the Court also notes that the decision as to whether a case or controversy exists in the context of \na patent declaratory judgment claim will necessarily be a fact [-\n]specific one[; i]t must be  made in consideration of all relevant \ncircumstances.\n10  And the burden[ i]s on the party asserting the \ndeclaratory judgment jur isdiction,  here [P laintiff ], to establish that \nan Article  [III]  case or controversy existed at the time that  the \nclaim was filed and that it has continued  since.11 \n With the relevan [t] law set out [,] let me turn to the merits.  And \nhere, as the Court has already noted, it will conclude that [] [P]laintiff has demonstrated that [D] efendants  have taken \naffirmative acts related to  enforcement of their patent rights \nsufficient to  create an actual controversy between the parties  \nregarding infringement of the five patents [-]in[-]suit. \n Now, let me explain why the Court believes this to be so.  The [F]ederal [C]ircuit has  made reference to several factors that courts  \nshould consider in determining whether the patentee in a situation like this has  sufficiently put at issue the requisite  affirmative acts.  \nHere, many of those factors  apply, counseling in favor of denial of \nthe motion.  First, the [F] ederal [C]ircuit[ has]  noted that a patentee\u2019s[ \n\u201c]aggressive enforcement  strategy, even in the absence of direct \n \n8 Cat Tech LLC v. TubeMaster, Inc. , 528 F.3d 871, 881 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \n  \n9  (D.I. 22 at 17)  \n \n10  Intel Corp. v. Future Link Sys., LLC, Civil Action No. 14-377-LPS, 2015 WL \n649294, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 12, 2015) (citing cases).    \n11  Id. (citing cases).  \n 5 \n threats  against the declaratory [judgment] plaintiff, may  support \njurisdiction [.\u201d]12 \n \nThe record shows that [D] efendant [] IV, does, in fact, have an \naggressive strategy  of enforcing the many patents that they own, a \nstrategy that IV made sure [P] laintiff was aware  of before the \ninstant suit.   In paragraph 13 of the [C]omplaint and on pages 5 \nand 17 of the presentation[] that  IV made to [P] laintiff in April \n2022, two months before [P]laintiff sued here, IV\u2019 s strategy is  \ndescribed.  In the April 2022 presentation, which I [ wi]ll refer to \nherein simply as [\u201c] the presentation [,\u201d] IV explained that its \nbusiness model involved investing billions of dollars to acquire tens of thousands of patents, which in turn has generated IV billions of dollars in  licensing  revenue.\n13  In that presentation, IV \nalso noted that it had filed over 130 court cases to date against \nmore than 70 companies and it had generated over one billion in licensing  revenue through litigation, including litigation against  \n[\u201c]15 of HPE\u2019s top 20 competitors.[\u201d]\n14 \n In other words, as a general matter, IV made sure that [P] laintiff \nknew just a short time before this case was filed that first, IV was the type of entity that had sued parties just like [P] laintiff in the \npast; second, that its business model was focused on doing so; and third, that this business model had successfully brought IV significant revenue due to settlements paid in federal patent litigation.  \n Second, and relatedly, the [F]ederal  [C]ircuit has explained that \n[\u201c]prior litigious conduct [\u201d] is another circumstance to be \nconsidered in assessing whether the totality of circumstances created an  actual controversy.\n15 \n Now, to be sure, the [F]ederal  [C]ircuit has cautioned that simply \nbecause a patentee may have, for example, filed one lawsuit concerning different products covered by unrelated patents against an accused infringer, that [ i]s not the type of a pattern of conduct \n \n12  Microsoft Corp. v. DataTern, Inc ., 755 F.3d 899, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ( hereinafter  \n\u201cDataTern\u201d) . \n \n13  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 13; id ., ex. 7 at 17)   \n  \n14   ( Id., ex. 7 at 5)   \n \n15  Prasco LLC v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 537 F.3d 1329, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \n 6 \n that itself could create declaratory j udgment jurisdiction as to any \npatent in the patentee \u2019s portfolio.16 \n \nBut here [,] IV\u2019s prior conduct against [P]laintiff amounted to much \nmore than  that.  For example, as set out in the [C]omplaint [,] in \n2021, IV sued [P] laintiff three different times  in the United States \nDistrict Court in the  Western District of Texas [,] or the [\u201c W]estern  \n[D]istrict. [\u201d]17  It sued [] [P] laintiff for patent infringement in \nthose three cases [,] asserting a total of 12 different patents.18  First, \nin March  of 2021, IV sued [P]laintiff on seven patents in the \n[W]estern [D]istrict.19  Importantly[,] among the products at issue \nin that case are [P] laintiff \u2019s Intelligen [t] Edge products.20  In June \n2021, IV filed a second suit against [P] laintiff in the  [W]estern \n[D]istrict asserting four additional patents [,] and in December of \n2021, IV filed a third suit against [P] laintiff in the [W]estern  \n[D]istrict, again asserting an additional patent.21 \n Moreover, according to the [C]omplaint, in a March 2022 telephone call, IV stated that it would continue to sue [P] laintiff  on \nother patents in IV\u2019s portfolio.\n22 \n So, to recap, by early 2022, [P] laintiff had seen IV file suit against \nit for  patent infringe ment three different times and  those suits had \nkept coming[,] one every few  months.  Simply from looking at this \npattern of prior litigation, [P] laintiff might have  reasonably thought \nthat absent some a greement  between the parties [,] another IV suit \nagainst it was coming right around the corner.  As a side note, after the instant suit here was filed by [P] laintiff in \nearly [ ] June of 202[2], IV went on to file suit against [P] laintiff \ntwo more times.   Four weeks after the instant suit was filed in late \nJune of 2022, IV sued [P] laintiff again in the [W]estern [D]istrict \n \n16  Id. \n \n17  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-18 & ex. 6) \n \n18  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 15 -18) \n \n19  (Id. at \u00b6 16)  \n \n20  ( Id.) \n \n21  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18) \n \n22  ( Id. at \u00b6 25) \n 7 \n asserting two more patents.23  And then in October of 2022, IV \nsued [P] laintiff in this [C]ourt, alleging infringement of three \nadditional patents, again accusing [P] laintiff \u2019s Intelligent Edge \nproducts, which are also at issue in the instant suit.24 \n \nOf course[,] subject matter  jurisdiction is assessed at the date of the  \nfiling of the complaint at issue,25 which here [wa] s filed on June \n2[], 2022,26 before these two  additional post[- C]omplaint suits \nwere initiated [.]  [S]o the [C]ourt will not rely on these post[-\nC]omplaint facts in order to conclude that there[ i] s subject matter \njurisdiction here [.]  [B]ut certainly these post [-C]omplaint facts do [ \nno]t suggest that after the [C]omplaint\u2019 s filing [, D] efendants began \ntaking steps that might be said  to de[-] escalate the fear of \ncontinuing litigation  against [P] laintiff.  Instead, it[ i] s worth \nnoting that [ IV] did the opposite. \n Third, the [F]ederal [C]ircuit has  explained that the presence of \nany accusations of infringement or threats of suit is a relevant factor to the question of whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.\n27  And here, as set out in [ P] laintiff \u2019s [C]omplaint,28 in the \nCourt\u2019 s view,  the content of IV\u2019s April 2022 presentation did \namount to an explicit threat to sue [P] laintiff on  the patents [-]in[-\n]suit as to, at a minimum,  [P]laintiff \u2019s Intelligent Edge product \nline, including its Aruba products.  This  presentation, at a \nminimum, amounted to an implicit threat, but again [,] the Court \nbelieves it  also was an explicit threat to sue in this  regard.  \n For instance, the presentation states that [P] laintiff \u2019s revenue relies \non core technologies that [\u201c] significantly overlap[\u201d]  with IV \u2019s \npatent portfolio and that IV [\u201c] continues mining and claim charting \nmore assets with respect to[\u201d]  HPE \u2019s products.\n29  The presentation \nspecifically called  out [] [P] laintiff \u2019s Aruba offerings as one of \n \n23  (D.I. 22 at 1)   \n \n24  (D.I. 33) \n \n25  DataTern, 755 F.3d at 906. \n \n26  (D.I. 2) \n \n27  Prasc o, 537 F.3d at  1339; see also Microsoft , 484 F. Supp. 3d at  178. \n \n28  (D.I. 2 at \u00b6 25 ) \n \n29  ( Id., ex. 7 at 15) \n 8 \n those very product lines that [P] laintiff was  currently claim \ncharting against.30  In the presentation [,] IV also asserted that \n[\u201ca]ll major HP [E] products and services shall soon stand accused \nunder IV patents [\u201d] and that [\u201c a]lready [-]accused products and \nservices  shall soon stand accused under more IV patents.[\u201d]31  \nSo[,] even simply looking at these [portions] of the presentation as \nI just  described, [P] laintiff [] could reasonably infer that IV was \ntelling it that first, IV believed  that more of [P] laintiff \u2019s products \ninfringed IV \u2019s patents; second, IV was actively preparing to sue \n[P]laintiff in the future on such products; and third, [P] laintiff \u2019s \nAruba offerings were one of the product lines as to which \n[P]laintiff could  expect to be sued. \n But the presentation went further.  On page 12 of the presentation, as [P] laintiff has  noted, IV included a graphic that listed what it \nfelt was the  [\u201cc]urrent [p] icture [\u201d] as to which of its patents were \n[\u201c]relevant  to HPE. [\u201d]\n32  11 of the approximately 80 patents that \nwere listed on that slide were patents that IV  had already sued \n[P]laintiff on.33  Those 80 patents were broken up into whether \nthey were relevant  to HPE \u2019s Intelligent Edge product line, which \nincludes the Aruba Intelligent Edge products at issue in this case [,] \nor certain other product lines.34  And on the part of the slide \nrelating to  HPE \u2019s Intelligent Edge products [,] there were 37  \npatents [,] including three that IV had previously sued [P] laintiff on \nin the [W]estern [D]istrict.35  At the bottom of the slide, IV stated  \n[\u201c]IV continues mining the portfolio for relevant assets [;] HPE \nmay infringe additional patents which span all segments, incl [.] \n[Compute], HPC, [S]torage and Edge [U]nits. [\u201d]36 \n \nThe Court agrees with [P] laintiff  that this language on slide 12 \namounted to an explicit statement that IV believed that all of  the \n \n30  ( Id.) \n \n31  ( Id. at 7)  \n \n32  ( Id. at 12) \n \n33  ( Id.)   \n \n34  ( Id.) \n \n35  ( Id.) \n \n36  ( Id.) \n 9 \n relevant patents listed on the slide were being infringed by HPE.37  \nIt disagrees with  [Defendants\u2019]  suggestion that this was an \nambiguous statement in that regard.  There[ i] s no other way to \nread that part of slide 12[,] in which IV was saying that HPE may \ninfringe additional  patents other than the ones at issue on the \nslide [,] than as a statement that IV believed HPE  did, in fact, \ninfringe all the patents that were  listed on that slide.  \n  \nSo when you put all this together, it[ i]s clear that with the slide on \npage 12 of its presentation IV was telling [] [P] laintiff,  first, this is \na list of patents that your referenced products infringe; second, that we[ ha]ve already sued you on some of these patents; and third, \nyou can expect that we will sue you on any or all of the other patents listed here in  the future if a resolution is not reached and \nparticularly as to the Intelligent Edge products at issue in this case. On that slide, [P] laintiff  was given a core list of 34 remaining \n[Intellige nt Edge] patents on  which it might expect to be sued[, \nincluding the patents- in-suit]. \n In the briefing[,] [D] efendants  brushed these statements off by \nsaying IV had [\u201c] not once presented even a single claim chart to \nHPE regarding the DJ patents [,] let alone  made a direct accusation \nof infringement.[\u201d]\n38  But in Hewlett [-]Packard Co [.] v[.] \nA[c]celeron LLC , the [F] ederal [C]ircuit explicitly  rejected this \nexact argument, stating that [\u201c] it[ i]s implausible  [. . .] to expect \nthat a  competent lawyer drafting such correspondence for a patent \nowner would identify specific claims, present claim charts [,] and \nexplicitly  allege infringement. [\u201d]39  So certainly  presentation of \nclaim charts as to a patent [is] not required before subject matter jurisdiction  can attach.  \n And here, as the Court set out [,] in  its view, IV did make an \nexplicit threat of  [suit] on page 12 of that presentation or at the \nvery least an implicit threat as to the  patents [-]in[-]suit on the \nIntelligent Edge products at issue here.  \n Now, the Court [ha ]s previously noted[,] and it emphasizes here \nagain, [that] subject matter  jurisdiction  questions like this one have \nto be assessed on a case-by- case basis [,] taking into  account all \n \n37  See Hewlett -Packard , 587 F.3d at 1363. \n \n38  (D.I. 19 at 2; see also id. at 6) \n \n39  587 F.3d at 1362.   \n 10 \n relevant facts.  If only some but not all the facts that the  Court has \nnow set out, that is, the facts regarding IV\u2019s aggressive \nenforcement strategy generally or its  history of suing [P] laintiff \nparticularly,  including as to the products at issue here [,] or the \ntenor of the assertions it made in the presentation [\u2014]if only some \nbut not all of those facts had been present, then perhaps the decision here might be different.  For example,  imagine a world \nwhere the only pre- suit act IV  had taken were to have simply sent \n[P]laintiff [] a listing of the patents in its portfolio like the  listing on \npage 14 of the April 2022 presentation and [that it] simply had asked [P] laintiff to  review those patents and consider whether it \nwishes to take a portfolio license.  If that  were the factual record \nhere, then the outcome of the motion might well have been different.   But the Court has to take into account all of the above[-\n]referenced facts that were at issue here as described in the \n[C]omplaint.  And in doing so, those facts show that IV was, in fact, taking affirmative acts to show [] [P] laintiff  that IV intended \nto enforce its rights to the  patents [-]in[-]suit sufficient to create an \nactual  controversy between the parties. \n Before the Court concludes, it also takes a moment to distinguish a case that  [D]efendants relied upon most heavily in their briefing[: ] \nGoDaddy.com v [.] RPost  Communications, Limited, a case from \nthe United  States [D]istrict [C]ourt for the District of  Arizona that \nwas issued  . . . in December of 20[14].\n40  The Court agrees with \n[P]laintiff that this case hurts  rather than helps [D] efendant [s\u2019] \nposition.  In  GoDaddy.com  two of the patents[-] in[-]suit were  \ndefendant\u2019s '219 Patent and its '334 Patent.41  The  GoDaddy.com  \n[C]ourt found that there was subject matter jurisdiction over suit as to the '219 Patent, but not as to the '334 Patent.\n42  Defendants here \nwrongfully analogize the patents[-] in[-]suit in this case to that '334 \npatent in  GoDaddy.com  when, in fact, in the Court\u2019 s view,  the five \npatents here are more like the '219 Patent that was at issue in that case.  \n In GoDaddy.com , defendant, who [wa]s the patentee, had sent \nplaintiff a presentation  entitled [\u201cS] ummary of [P]reliminary \n[I]nfringement [A]nalysis.[\u201d]\n43  It listed the '219 Patent as one of \n \n40 No. CV-14-00126- PHX-JAT, 2014 WL 6908520 (D. Ariz. Dec. 9, 2014 ). \n  \n41  Id. at *1.  \n \n42  Id. at *6 , *8. \n \n43  Id. at *2. 11 \n five p atents for which [\u201c A]dditional [R]ecommended [R]eview[\u201d]  \nwas needed. []44  Among the other four patents on that five- patent \nlist was one  that defendant had already expressly asserted  against \nplaintiff.45  The GoDaddy.com  [C]ourt found that by listing the \n'219 Patent alongside a previously asserted patent, this reasonably \nindicated to plaintiff that defendant also  intended to assert the '219 \nPatent against it.46  And so the Court concluded that subject matter \njurisdiction existed as to the '219 Patent.47 \n Here, in its April 2022 presentation, IV listed the five patents[-] in[-\n]suit alongside three other patents relevant to HPE\u2019s Intelligent \nEdge product line that IV had already sued [P]laintiff on.  At the bottom of that slide, as the [] Court has noted, IV told HPE that [it] believed that HPE infringed those five patents [-]in[-]suit. \n So[,] in line with the reasoning of the GoDaddy.com  [C]ourt, this \nlisting of the five  patents [-]in[-]suit here along with others that IV \nhad previously sued on alone could have given [P] laintiff reason to \nbelieve that a case or  controversy had been established as to those \nfive patents.    Conversely, the GoDaddy.com  [C]ourt  concluded that there was no \nsubject matter  jurisdiction over the '334 Patent at issue in that case, \nbut that was because this '334 Patent had only been listed along with numerous other of the defendant\u2019s patents in an e- mail and a  \nletter to plaintiff [\u201c] with no specific attention drawn to them.[\u201d]\n48 \n In the Court\u2019s view, the '334 Patent in GoDaddy.com  might be said \nto be equivalent to an IV patent [that]  was simply listed on  page 14 \nof IV \u2019s April 2022 presentation, that is [,] the slide that simply \nincluded reference to over  300 patents that were in IV\u2019s portfolio \nalong with the notation that [\u201c]HPE can benefit  from a portfolio-\nwide license.[\u201d]\n49 \n \n \n44  Id. at *5.   \n \n45  Id. \n \n46  Id. at *6, *8. \n \n47  Id. \n \n48  Id. at *5.   \n \n49  (D.I. 2, ex. 7 at 14) 12 \n The decision in GoDaddy.com  also rebuts another argument of \n[D]efendants here[\u2014]that there[ i] s something wrong with the fact \nthat [P]laintiff sued  it . . . on only five of the 37 patents listed on \npage 12 of IV\u2019 s presentation [.]50  In the Court\u2019s view, [P] laintiff \ncould have rightly sued [D]efendants on any of those other patents \nlisted in that grouping had it wished to do so.51  But as the \nGoDaddy.com  [C]ourt explained, if there is subject matter  \njurisdiction as to a group of patents owned by the patentee[,] then a declaratory judgment plaintiff is  [\u201c]free to choose [\u201d] which patents \nof that group [to] litigate.\n52  Plaintiff  rightly did that here as to the \nfive patents [-]in[-]suit. \n Finally, . . . the law says that even where a court concludes that there is a case or controversy under the Declaratory Judgment Act as to certain patents,  the [c] ourt can still decline to hear the matter  \nin its discretion.\n53  In deciding whether to entertain a declaratory \njudg[]ment request, the [c]ourt has to determine whether resolving \nthe case serves the objectives for which the Declaratory Judgment Act was created.\n54  Here[,]  it makes sense for the Court to exercise \nits discretion to permit this suit to proceed  forward.  The [F]ederal \n[C]ircuit has explained that  the Declaratory Judg []ment Act was \nmeant to allow  a party like [P] laintiff to proceed with suit in a  case \nlike this in order to avoid the difficult choice of either seeing its liability to  [D]efendants grow or otherwise having to abandon its \noffering of Intelligent Edge Aruba products.\n55 \n Moreover, for the reasons that [P]laintiff sets out on pages 18 to 19 of its  answering brief,\n56 [D]efendant [s\u2019] arguments as  to why the \n \n50  (D.I. 19 at 6)   \n \n51  The Court also notes parenthetically that it [ i]s sensible that [P]laintiff only chose \na small number of those patents on[] which to sue, [as]  suing on all of those patents in that group \nwould have created challenges for the Court and litigants and likely would have wasted resources.   \n \n52  2014 WL 6908520, at *6.   \n \n53  Wilton v.
