Andrews", "date": "12-09-2022", "ocr_text": "1 \n  \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n  KENIO CRICHLOW,    : \n      :   Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22 -272-RGA \n      : DELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF   : \nCORRECTION, et al.,    :  \n      :   Defendants.    : \n  \nMEMORANDUM \nORDER  \nAt Wilmington, this 9th day of December , 2022;  \nIT IS ORDERED that  Plaintiff  Kenio Crichlow\u2019s  request for counsel (D.I. 10) is \nDENIED without prejudice to renew, and Crichlow\u2019s  motion for class certification (D.I. \n11) is DENIED. \nRequest for Counsel.   Crichlow  requests counsel on the grounds that he is \nunable to afford counsel, he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to retain pro bono \ncounsel, the case is complex, he has filed a motion for class certification,  he has limited \naccess to legal materials and no ability to investigate, the case will require discovery and expert medical testimony, and he is hampered by medical problems arising from his contraction of COVID -19 in April 2020.  A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis  \nhas no constitutional or statutory right to representation by counsel.\n0F1  See Brightwell v. \n \n1 See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa , 490 U.S. 296, 301 \n(1989)  (noting that \u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to \nrequire an unwilling attorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in 2 \n Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. \n1993).  However, representation by counsel may be appropriate under certain \ncircumstances, after a finding that a plaintiff\u2019s claim has arguable merit in fact and law.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.   \n After passing this threshold inquiry, cour ts should consider a number of factors \nwhen assessing a request for counsel.  Factors to be considered by a court in deciding \nwhether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the merits of \nthe plaintiff\u2019s claim; (2) the plaintiff \u2019s ability to present his or her case considering his or \nher education, literacy, experience, and the restraints placed upon him or her by \nincarceration; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to which factual investigation is required and the plaintiff\u2019s ability to pursue such investigation; (5) the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and (6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony.  See \nMontgomery v. Pinchak , 294 F.3d 492, 498- 99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155- 56.  \nThe list is not exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.   \n Assuming, solely for the purpose of deciding this motion, that Crichlow\u2019s  claims \nhave merit in fact and law , several of the Tabron factors militate against granting his \nrequest for counsel at this time.  Based on my review of the complaint, which centers on \na two block march by 21 inmates , who had tested positive for COVID -19, in the pouring \nrain on April 30, 2020, the case is not complex ,  and Crichlow appears to have the \nability to present his claims.  In addition, this case is in its  very early stages.  Finally, as \n \nthe statute being \u201crequest.\u201d).    3 \n discussed below, I will deny Crichlow\u2019s  motion for class certification, which, if granted,  \ncould have added to the complexity of the case.  \n Motion for Class Certification.   As noted, Crichlow alleges that he was among \na group of 21 inmates who were forced in April 2020 to walk in the rain after testing \npositive for COVID -19.  (D.I. 3 at 4).  In  his motion, Crichlow seeks to certify a \u201cclass \ncomposed of 21 inmates who currently or were required [to] walk a distance [of] about \ntwo block[s] in drenching rain pushing carts containing their personals ,\u201d after testing \npositive for COVID -19, with  many being  severely ill.   (D.I. 11 at 1 ).   \nFour prerequisites must be met to obtain certification of a class: (1) the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the c laims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \nRegarding the first prerequisi te, numerosity, the Third Circuit has explained that, \nwhile  \"no minimum number of plaintiffs is required to maintain a suit as a class action,\"  \nclasses comprised of 20 or fewer members are generally  insufficiently numerous , \nclasses containing over 40 members are generally  sufficiently numerous; and classes of \n21 to 40 members \u201c may or may not meet the numerosity requirement depending on the \ncircumstances.\"  In re Modafinil Antitrust Litig. , 837 F.3d 238, 249- 50 (3d Cir. 2016)  \n(citations and internal quotations omitted) ; see also Stewart v. Abraham , 275 F.3d 220, \n226-27 (3d Cir. 2001) .  Crichlow\u2019s proposed class of 21 inmates is situated at the low 4 \n end of the middle category. 1F2   \nThe question becomes whether joinder would be impracticable for a proposed \nclass falling in this middle range, as opposed to proceeding as a class action.  Id.  at \n252-53.  To answer this question, C ourts consider the following non -exhaustive list of \nfactor s to determine whether the proposed class is sufficiently numerous:   (1) judicial \neconomy; (2) the proposed class members' ability and motivation to litigate as joined \nplaintiffs; (3) the class members' financial resources; (4) the geographic dispersion of  \nclass members; (5) the ability to identify future claimants; and (6) whether the claims are for injunctive relief or damages.\n2F3  Id.  The first two factors are given the most weight.  Id.  \nUpon consideration of these factors, I conclude that joinder would not be impracticable, \nnoting in particular that judicial economy and Crichlow\u2019s 20 fellow inmates\u2019 ability and motivation to litigate as joined plaintiffs would not be impediments, that there is little to no geographic dispersion of the inmates,  that there is no need to identify future \nclaimants, and that Crichlow\u2019s complaint seeks damages in addition to injunctive relief.  \nCf. 5 James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 23.22 (\u201cIn cases in which \nonly injunctive or declaratory relief is sought, some courts have held that the numerosity \nrequirement is relaxed.\u201d).  \n \n2 Although Crichlow states in his motion for class certification that \u201c[t]he approximate \nnumber of the class may exceed 21,\u201d (D.I. 11 at 1), his proposed class is defined to \ninclude only the group forced to walk in the rain, which he has alleged in his complaint and motion was a group of 21 inmates.  \n \n3 \u201cThese factors are only relevant to a binary choice at the certification stage: a class \naction versus joinder of all interested parties ,\u201d and courts  \u201cdo not consider the possibility \nthat plaintiffs may bring individual suits. \u201d  Modafinil Antitrust Litig ., 837 F.3d at 253.  5 \n Furthermore, regarding the fourth and final prerequisite for certifying a class, \nadequacy of representation, I note that Crichlow  is an incarcerated individual and he \nappears pro se.   A[P]ro se  litigants are generally not appropriate as class \nrepresentatives. @  Hagan v. Rogers , 570 F.3d 146, 158- 59 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing \nOxendine v. Williams , 509 F.2d 1405, 1407 (4th Cir. 1975) ( A[I]t is plain error to permit \n[an] imprisoned litigant who is unassisted by counsel to represent his fellow inmates in a \nclass action)).  Crichlow may not represent other plaintiffs or proceed as the class \nrepresentative and, as discussed above, I will deny h is request for counsel.  Inasmuch \nas Crichlow proceeds pro se, I conclude that class certification is inappropriate for this \nadditional reason.  See Hagan, 570 F.3d at 159 (noting that it was inappropriate for the district court to deny class certification on the basis of inadequate representation without \nfirst deciding the plaintiff's motion to appoint counsel as the district court had deferred any consideration of the plaintiff =s motion to appoint counsel).  \n      \n      /s/ Richard G.
