(D.I. 1 -1 at 2 ).  The matter was removed to this Court on April 21, 2021.  (D.I. 1).  \nDefendant  United States of America (\u201c Defendant \u201d) move s for dismissal  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) .  (D.I. 5).   The matter is fully briefed.   \nI. BACKGROUND \n Plaintiff\u2019s claim arises under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), \n2671- 2680.  The Amended Complaint alleges  that Henrietta Johnson Medical Center  (\u201cMedical \nCenter\u201d)  and Dr. Mia Holmes  (\u201cDr. Holmes\u201d)  were negligent in providing Plaintiff  medical and \ndental care in January 2019.  (D.I. 1- 1 at 2-10).  Upon removal, the United States was substituted \nfor the M edical C enter and Dr. Holmes.  (D.I. 4, 7).   \nAs alleged, Plaintiff presented to the  Medical Center  on January 9, 2019, and saw \nDr. Holmes  who performed a tooth extraction.  (D.I. 1 -1 at 2-3).  Plaintiff alleges that Dr.  Holmes \nbreached the applicable standard of care during Plaintiff\u2019s tooth extraction on January 9, 2019, \nwhich resulted in injuries.   (Id. at 3) .  On October 8, 2019, Plaintiff submitted  an administrative \ntort claim pursuant to the FTCA  to the United States Department of Health and Human  Services \n(\u201cHHS\u201d) alleging \u201cnegligent tooth extraction leading to facial pain infection & numerous other \nprocedures.\u201d   (D.I. 6).  The c laim was denied on February 25, 2020.  (D.I. 5 -1 at 2 -3). \nOn December 15, 2020, approximate ly ten months after the denial of her c laim, Plaintiff  \nsubmitted a second claim in an attempt to amend the  original claim, construed by HHS as a motion \nfor reconsideration.  (D.I. 6 -1 at 2 -4).  Plaintiff wrote to HHS counsel  on March 1, 2021, regarding \nthe r equest for reconsideration and asked for copies of any documents pertaining to her 2 administrative tort claim.  (D.I. 9 at 87).  On February 23, 2021, Plaintiff was advised that the \nagency received the written request for reconsideration in the format of a duplicate claim submission on December 9, 2020, more than six months after February 25, 2020; that Plaintiff  did \nnot file a timely written request for reconsideration, and the agency would not consider the request under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9(b) ; and  that the administrative claim remained denied and the agency\u2019s file \nwas closed.  ( Id. at 88 ).  In the meantime, o n Janu ary 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed suit in the Superior \nCourt of  the State of Delaware alleging negligence by Defendant.   (See D.I. 1).   \nDefendant moves for dismissal on the grounds that the Complaint was not timely filed and \nis time -barred.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se , her pleading is liberally construed and her  Complaint, \n\u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  When presented with a motion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6), district courts conduct a two- part \nanalysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  First, the Court separates \nthe factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well -pleaded facts as \ntrue, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Id . at 210- 11.  Second, the Court determines \n\u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show . . . a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  \n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u2019\u201d  Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d  227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell  Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate if a 3 complaint does not contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief \nthat is plausib le on its face.\u2019\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570); see also \nFowler , 578 F.3d at 210.  A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defend ant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\u201d  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  The Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions\u201d or \n\u201cunsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences.\u201d  Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) ; Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co., \n113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997).  Instead, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a \nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff\u2019s claim.  Wilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc ., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. \n2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, a  court may consider the pleadings, public \nrecord, orders, exhibits attached to the complaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).    \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDefendant moves for dismissal on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to file her Complaint \nwithin six months after th e notice of final denial administrative claim and, therefore, her claim is \ntime-barred.  (D.I. 5).  \nUnder the FTCA,  \u201ca tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless  . . . \naction is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice \nof final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented. \u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) .  \u201cPrior \nto the commencement of suit and prior to the expiration of the 6 -month period provided in \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b), a claimant . . . may file a written request with the agency for reconsideration of a final denial of a claim under paragraph (a) of this section.\u201d  28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9(b).  When a 4 motion for reconsideration is timely filed, the time to file a civil action \u201cdoes not accrue until 6 \nmonths after the filing of a request for reconsideration.\u201d   Id.  The six- month limitation period for \nfiling an FTCA suit is not jurisdictional and is subject to equitable tolling.   United States v. Wong, \n575 U.S. 412, 419 (2015) .  \n Defendants are correct that Plaintiff did not timely file  the instant lawsuit.  Plaintiff did not \nsubmit her motion for reconsideration within six months of the February 25, 2020 denial.  I t was \nsubmitted on December 15, 2020, some four months late.  Because the motion for reconsideration \nwas not timely, Plaintiff was required to file suit on or before August 25, 2020.  Plaintiff did not commence this action until January 8, 2021.  \nPlaintiff  states that she was required to retain new counsel after her case remained \nuntouched for eight months by her first attorney.  (D.I. 8 at 1; D.I. 9 at 11).   By letter dated \nSeptember 25, 2019,  HHS advised the second attorney that no administrativ e tort had been filed \non Plaintiff\u2019s behalf, the second attorney filed a claim with HHS on October 1, 2019 and, on \nSeptember 2, 2020, he sought an affidavit of merit  from Dr. Sander White  (\u201cWhite\u201d) .  (D.I. 9 at \n15-16, 20).   By letter dated February 25, 2020 received by counsel on February 27, 2020, HHS \nnotified Plaintiff  through her attorney that the FTCA claim was denied and of the right to file suit \nor request reconsideration within six months from the date of mailing of the denial letter.  (D.I. 5-1 at 2-6).  On December 11, 2020, Dr. White informed  Plaintiff\u2019s attorney of his conclusion that \nthere w as no negligence.  (D.I. 9 at 89).  Plaintiff states  that \u201csuddenly on December 11, 2020 [ her \nattorney ] informed her that the affidavit of merit was denied  and he can  no longer take the case. \u201d  \n(D.I. 8 at 2).  Plaintiff was advised , \nAs we discussed back in December, we retained Dr. White to issue \nan affidavit that your case had merit as is required to file a \nmalpractice claim.  Unfortunately he found no malpractice was committed in your case. . . For this reason we advised you back in 5 December that we could not [sic]  longer  pursue your malpractice \ncase.  \n \n(D.I. 9 at 19).   \nPlaintiff argues  that due to the attorney\u2019s \u201cun professionalism and mishandling time \nsensitive material Plaintiff was forced to research t he appropriate parties, gather all documentation \nfor [a] tort claim, file a second tort claim within f ive days, type an [sic] notice of intent to file \nlawsuit . . . , file a malpractice suit in superior court, was denied, pressured to find an affidavit of \nmerit, and refiled the com plaint successfully back in [the] Super ior Court on March 18, 2019.\u201d  \n(Id. at 3).  Plaintiff argues that because the request for reconsideration was filed under  urgent \ncircumstances she should be allowed to take advantage of the extension for filing an FTCA suit as \nprovided by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9(b).  Plaintiff argues that she was forced to finish her FTCA claim as a pro se  plaintiff due to legal malpractice.   Defen dant argues that it appears Plaintiff\u2019s attorney \nmade a \u201csimple miscalculation\u201d that lead to missing the filing deadline . \n Given the circumstances, the Court must determine whether equitable tolling applies.  An \notherwise untimely claim may nevertheless be  permitted via equitable tolling in situations \n\u201c(1) where the defendant has actively misled the plaintiff respecting the plaintiff \u2019s cause of action; \n(2) where the plaintiff in some extraordinary way has been prevented from asserting [his or] her rights; o r (3) where the plaintiff has timely asserted [his or] her rights mistakenly in the wrong \nforum.\u201d  D.J.S.- W. ex rel. Stewart v. United States , 962 F.3d 745, 750 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting \nOshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1387 (3d Cir. 1994), abrogated on \nother grounds by Rotkiske v. Klemm , 890 F.3d 422, 428 (3d Cir. 2018) (en banc)).  A  litigant \u201cwill \nnot receive the benefit of\u201d tolling in any of these situations \u201cunless she exercised due diligence in \npursuing and preserving her cl aim.\u201d   D.J.S. -W. ex rel , 962F.3d 750 (quoting Santos  ex rel. Beato \nv. United States , 559 F.3d 189, 197 (3d Cir. 2009) .  In addition, tolling will never extend to \u201ca 6 garden variety claim of excusable neglect, such as a simple miscalculation that leads a law yer to \nmiss a filing deadline. \u201d  Id. at 750 (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 651-52 (2010)  \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n Given the facts at hand, the Court considers whether  Plaintiff has shown that she diligently \npursued her rights and whether some extraordinary circumstance stood in her way.  In this case, \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d involve an attorney\u2019s failure to satisfy professional standards of \ncare.   The United Stat es Supreme Court has noted that several lower courts have specifically held \nthat unprofessional attorney conduct may, in certain circumstances, prove \u201cegregious\u201d and can be \u201cextraordinary.\u201d  Holland, 560 U.S. at 651 ( case string citations omitted).  \n The re cord facts in this case may well be an \u201cextraordinary\u201d instance in which Plaintiff\u2019s  \nattorney \u2019s conduct constituted far more than \u201cgarden variety\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d   First, there \nis no doubt that  Plaintiff\u2019s attorney failed to file  a motion for reconsideration or  this action  within \nthe six month deadline required under the FTCA , despite HHS informing him on \nFebruary 25, 2020, that he had six months to file for reconsideration and if denied, six months \nfrom the date of the mailing of the determination to file suit in the appropriate district court, or six months to file suit in district court fr om the date of determination if reconsideration  was not sought.  \n(D.I. 5 -1 at 2 -3).  The HHS letter was sent to Pla intiff\u2019s attorney, she w as not copied on the letter, \nand it  does not appear that Plaintiff\u2019s attorney advised her that HHS denied her claim.   In addition, \nthe attorney requested an affidavit of merit from Dr . White on September 2, 2020, after the \ndeadline to file suit had passed.  Moreover, it was not until  December 11, 2020, the same day that \nDr. White notified  Plaintiff\u2019s  attorney that there was no negligence , that the attorney notified \nPlaintiff he could no longer pursue her malpractice claim, leaving it to Plaintiff to proceed w ith \nthe action, even though by that time, the attorney had missed both the deadline  to submit a motion 7 for reconsideration and the deadline to file suit.  The attorney\u2019s inaction and failure seriously \nprejudiced his  client who thereby lost her opportunity to timely file her case.   \n In addition, \u201c[t]o invoke equitable tolling, [Plaintiff] must show that [she] exercised \nreasonable diligence in investigating and bringing [her] claims.\u201d  New Castle Cty. v. Halliburton \nNUS Corp., 111 F.3d 1116, 1126 (3d Cir. 1997) .  Once Plaintiff\u2019s attor ney told her that  he would \nno longer  represent her, Plaintiff contacted HHS , discovered it had ruled against her  and she \nimmediately filed a motion for reconsi deration .  When  no ruling came down she again  contacted \nHHS and was told the motion for reconside ration was untimely and the case was closed.   At that \npoint , she immediately filed a law suit.  Under the circumstances this Court finds that Plaintiff \ndiligently pursued her rights.    After carefully  considering the facts and the law, this Court concludes that  Plaintiff is \nentitled to equitable tolling.  Therefore, Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss will be denied.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the above reasons, the Court  will deny Defendant \u2019s motion to dismiss .  (D.I. 5) .  An \nappropriate order will be entered.     \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nKEYONA MCCREARY,  \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n \n  v. \n UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  \n \n   Defendant.  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n)  \n \n \nC.A.
