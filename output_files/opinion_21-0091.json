{"case_name": "MHL Custom, Inc. v. Waydoo USA, Inc. et al", "case_number": "21-0091", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "03-20-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMHL CUSTOM , INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nWA YDOO USA, INC. and SHENZHEN \nWA YDOO INTELLIGENCE \nTECHNOLOGY CO., LTD, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 21-0091-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nI have considered Plaintiffs motion in limine regarding the admissibility of the Evolo \nvideos and Evolo webpage (D.I. 180),1 Defendants' motion in limine regarding the admissibility \nof Evolo videos (D.I. 167), and whether Plaintiff's expert Mr. Barry may testify that the Evolo \nvideos demonstrate that the Evolo report is not enabling (D.I. 172 at 32-33). At the pre-trial \nconference I asked Plaintiff to identify four to six videos of the final two versions of the Evolo \nprototype, portions of Mr. Barry's report where he discusses those videos in the context of \nenablement, and where Mr. Barry or Dr. Triantafyllou, Defendants ' expert, identifies which \nversion of the Evolo prototype is in the video. (D.I. 194). I have considered Plaintiff's submission \n(D.I. 196) and Defendant's response (D.I. 197). \nPlaintiffs motion in limine (D.I. 180) is granted in part and denied in part. Likewise , \nDefendants' motion in limine (D.I. 167) is granted in part and denied in part. I address each piece \nof evidence in turn. \n1 Plaintiff's motion in limine also sought to exclude the Swedish magazine, Batnytt. (D.I. 180 at \n2). I determined the magazine was admissible. (D.I. 184 at 2). \nPage 1 of 5 Evolo Video 1 (Bates No. WD004548)2 is admissible. This video shows a trial run of what \nthe expert witnesses call the \"final Evolo prototype. \" (See D.I. 80-15, ,r 233 (showing a picture of \nthe \"final Evolo prototype\")). Mr. Barry cites to this video in his expert report. (D.I. 80-32, ,r,r 92, \n169-170). While neither Mr. Barry nor Dr. Triantafyllou specificall y identify this video as showing \nthe final Evolo prototype, the video sufficiently shows the watercraft such that one can identify it \nas the final Evolo prototype based on its appearance. Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4) . This video is \nrelevant, as Mr. Barry's report recites, \"To the extent that Dr. Triantafyllou asserts that any of the \nprototypes of the Evolo Report are passively static stability (sic), the Evolo Report is not enabled.\" \n(D.I. 80-32, Ex. 30, ,r 110, ,r 186 (same for \"passive stability\")). Therefore , this video is admissible , \nand Mr. Barry may testify about what it shows with respect to whether the Evolo Report is \nenabling. \nEvolo Video 2 (Bates No. WD004546)3 is admissible. This video shows a trial run of \"final \nEvolo prototype. \" (See D.I. 80-15, ,r 233 (showing a picture of the \"final Evolo prototype \")). Dr. \nTriantafyllou identifies the video as \"footage of the final Evolo prototype. \" (D.I. 80-15, ,r,r 235 \n(identifying video with the url and Bates No.)). Mr. Barry cites to this video in his expert report. \n(D.I. 80-32, ,r,r 92-93, 169-170). This video is relevant. Mr. Barry's report recites, \"To the extent \nthat Dr. Triantafyllou asserts that any of the prototypes of the Evolo Report are passively static \nstability (sic), the Evolo Report is not enabled.\" (D.I. 80-32, Ex. 30, ,r 110, ,r 186 (same for \"passive \nstability\")). Dr. Triantafyllou also cites to and discusses this video in his report. (D.I. 80-15, ,r,r \n2 A. Lundell, Evola prototype run, YouTube.com (May. 5, 2009), \nhttps:/ /www.youtube.com /watch?v=a-OCN 50a Wo. \n3 Jakob Kuttenkeuler , Evola movie, YouTube .com (Jun. 11, 2009), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=zL9f08tFl18 . \nPage 2 of 5 235-36). Therefore, this video is admissible , and Mr. Barry and Dr. Triantafyllou may testify about \nit with respect to whether the Evolo Report is enabling. \nEvolo Video 3 (Bates No. WD0045654)5 may be able to be used, and possibly admitted, \nduring cross-examination of Dr. Triantafyllou.6 Dr. Triantafyllou identifies this video as showing \na trial run of the X8 prototype by comparing an image of the watercraft in the Evolo Report with \na screenshot of the video. (D.I. 80-15, ,r,r 224-226, 232). Dr. Triantafyllou discusses this video in \nhis report. (See, e.g., id., ,r 226). Plaintiff concedes that this video is not referenced in Mr. Barry's \nreport. (D.I. 196 at 2). Therefore , Mr. Barry may not testify about it. \nEvolo Video 4 (Bates No. WD004544)7 may be able to be used, and possibly admitted, \nduring cross-examination of Dr. Triantafyllou. Dr. Triantafyllou identifies this video as showing a \ntrial run of the X8 prototype. (D .I. 80-15, ,r 23 2 (\"I believe that the prototypes depicted in these \nvideos were of the X8, given the similarities between the photograph on page 420 of the report \nand the videos.\")). Dr. Triantafyllou discusses this video in his report. (See, e.g., id., ,r 226). \n4 Plaintiff identifies this video with Bates No. WD004565 in its letter. (D.I. 196 at 3). Exhibit C \nto Plaintiffs letter (D.I. 196-3) lists this entry as WD004563 , but also has two entries with that \nsame Bates No. (See D.I. 196-3, Ex. C at 2). I believe the correct Bates No. is WD004565 as Dr. \nTriantafyllou identifies a video at the same url using that Bates No. (D.I. 80-15, ,r,r 226). \n5 A. Lundell, Project Evola, YouTube.com (Jan. 22, 2009), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W45pdr9 B9c. \n6 For Evolo Videos 3 and 4, I will not be able to tell whether Plaintiff will be able to use the \nvideos in cross-examination until I have heard Dr. Triantafyllou 's direct examination. If Plaintiff \nthinks the direct examination permits such cross-examination , Plaintiff is going to need to bring \nthat up with me at the time and get my express permission before any use of the two videos. \n7 A. Lundell, evolo experiment 4, YouTube.com (Dec. 1, 2008), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thgdqujzzNc. \nPage 3 of 5 Plaintiff concedes that this video is not referenced in Mr. Barry's report. (D.I. 196 at 2). Mr. Barry \nmay not testify about it. \nEvolo Video 5 (Bates No. WD004549),8 Evolo Video 6 (Bates No. WD004552) ,9 and \nEvolo Video 7 (Bates No. WD004558)10 are not admissible. Neither Mr. Barry nor Dr. \nTriantafyllou cite to these videos in their reports or purport to identify which Evolo prototypes are \nshown in the videos. The videos do not show enough of the watercraft to visually identify which \nwatercraft is being tested. Therefore, the videos are not admissible because there is insufficient \nevidence \"to support a finding that the item is what the [Plaintiff] claims it is.\" Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). \nEven if Plaintiff could identify the watercrafts, unless the watercrafts could be identified as the X8 \nor final Evolo prototype , I would exclude the videos as irrelevant, and, in the alternative, because \nany probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of confusion from the introduction of \nvideos of earlier versions of the prototype. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. I do not see how the performance \nof earlier versions of the Evolo prototype are relevant to addressing Defendants' anticipation or \nobviousness defenses when the Evolo Report discloses improvements in the form of subsequent \nprototypes. \nI find the screenshot of the webpage (D.I. 196-4, Ex. D) referencing the Evolo Report is \nadmissible for limited purposes. Defendants may use the webpage as evidence that the Evolo \nReport was publicly accessible prior to the priority date of Plaintiffs patents. \n8 Joacimwe, Evola student project, YouTube.com (Oct. 23, 2008), \nhttps ://www.youtube.com/watch ?v=3 vcR 4d8hAB0. \n9 Mikael Razola, Evola, YouTube.com (Oct. 30, 2008), \nhttps://www.youtube .com/watch?v=wP08wgPYh0c. \n10 Mikael Razola, Evola, YouTube.com (Oct. 30, 2008), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4pf0CFNDHU. \nPage 4 of 5 The statement on the webpage referring to the Evolo prototype as having an \"inherently \nunstable nature\" is admissible for addressing Defendants ' obviousness defense. (D.I. 196-4, Ex. \nD). This statement is relevant to whether a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSA) would be \nmotivated to modify the Evolo Report to create a stable eFoil. (D.I. 80-32, ,r,r 110, 186). In this \ncontext, the statement is not hearsay as it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted -\nthat Evolo is inherently unstable -but instead that a POSA would be discouraged from using Evolo \nto make a stable watercraft due to the existence of that statement. \nThe \"inherently unstable nature\" statement on the webpage is inadmissible for addressing \nDefendants ' anticipation defense. In this context, the statement is being offered to prove the truth \nof the matter asserted -that Evolo is inherently unstable. This is classic hearsay. Plaintiff argues \nthe webpage constitutes an exception to the hearsay rule as the statement in it is a present sense \nimpression . (D.I. 196 at 4 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 803(1)). I disagree. There is no evidence that the \nstatement on the webpage was made \"while or immediately after the declarant perceived it.\" Fed. \nR. Evid. 803(1). Therefore , the statement is inadmissible hearsay when used as evidence to address \nDefendants ' anticipation defense. \nPlaintiff's and Defendants ' motions in limine (D.I. 167; D.I. 180) are now RESOLVED . \nPage 5 of 5 "}
