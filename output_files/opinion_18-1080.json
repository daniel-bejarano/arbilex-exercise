Andrews", "date": "01-11-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMICHAEL EV ANS, \nPetitioner , \nV. \nKOLA WOLE AKINBA YO, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE , \nRespondents. Civil Action No. 18-1080-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nOn June 28, 2021, the Court denied Petitioner Michael Evans' habeas petition after \ndetermining that six claims were time-barred and one claim was not cognizable on federal habeas \nreview. (D.I. 56; D.I. 57) The Court also declined to issue a certificate of appealability with \nrespect to that decision. (D.I. 56 at 13-14; D.I. 57) On July 6, 2021, Petitioner filed two notices \nof appeal with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. (D.I. 58; D.I. 59) On July 9, 2021, Petitioner \nfiled in this Court a motion asking the Court to reconsider its refusal to issue a certificate of \nappealability (\"Motion for Reconsideration\") . (D.I. 61 at 1-2) On August 31, 2021, the Third \nCircuit denied the motion for a certificate of appealability that Petitioner filed in conjunction \nwith his notices of appeal. (D.I. 62) \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA motion for reargument/reconsideration may be filed pursuant Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 59(e) or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Motions for reconsideration filed \nwithin Rule 59(e)'s twenty-eight day filing period are construed as timely filed Rule 59(e) \nmotions to alter or amend judgment , rather than as Rule 60(b) motions for reconsideration. See Banister v. Davis, 140 S.Ct. 1698, 1708 (2020) (explaining that Rule 59(e) motions seeking \nreconsideration of the underlying decision are permitted in habeas proceedings and are not \nconsidered to be second or successive habeas petitions, unlike subsequent Rule 60(b) motions \nraising new issues); Blystone v. Horn, 664 F.3d 397,414 (3d Cir. 2011) (explaining that a timely \nRule 59(e) motion is not subjected to the \"statutory limitations imposed upon second or \nsuccessive collateral attacks on criminal judgments \"). Rule 59( e) is \"a device [] used to allege \nlegal error,\"1 and may only be used to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly \ndiscovered evidence. See Howard Hess Dental Labs, Inc. v. Dentsply Int'! Inc., 602 F.3d 237, \n251 (3d Cir. 2010). The scope of a Rule 59(e) motion is extremely limited,2 and may only be \nused to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence. See \nHoward Hess Dental Labs, Inc. v. Dentsply Int'! Inc., 602 F.3d 237,251 (3d Cir. 2010). The \nmoving party must show one of the following in order to prevail on a Rule 59(e) motion: (1) an \nintervening change in the controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence that was not \navailable when the court issued its order; or (3) the need to correct a clear error oflaw or fact or \nto prevent a manifest injustice. See Max's Seafood Cafe v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. \n1999). \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe Court construes the instant Motion for Reconsideration as a motion filed pursuant to \nRule 59(e), because it was filed within twenty-eight days after the entry of the Court's \n1 United States v. Fiorelli, 337 F.3d 282, 288 (3d Cir. 2003). \n2 See Error! Main Document Only.Blystone, 664 F.3d at 415; see also Brambles USA Inc. v. \nBlocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990). \n2 judgment.3 In the Motion, Petitioner conclusorily asserts that the Court should have issued a \ncertificate of appealability because (1) equitable tolling rendered six of his claims timely and (2) \nthe arguments in his Petition made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. \n(D.I. 61 at 3) These contentions , however, do not present any intervening change in law, the \navailability of previously unavailable evidence, or a \"clear error of law\" of the sort that would \ncompel reconsideration of the Court's denial of his\u00a7 2254 Petition or its refusal to issue a \ncertificate of appealability . The fact the Third Circuit considered and rejected the same \nassertions when it denied the motion for a certificate of appealability Petitioner filed in \nconjunction with his notices of appeal provides additional support for the Court's conclusion. \n(D.I. 62) Accordingly, the Court will deny the instant Motion for failing to satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 59(e). \nIn addition, an individual named Brandon Evans filed a letter asking to be added as a \nplaintiff in the instant proceeding. (D.I. 63) Given the decision to deny the instant Rule 59(e) \nMotion, the Court will summarily dismiss as moot Brandon Evans' un-related request to be \nadded as a plaintiff. \nIII. CONCLUSI ON \nBased on the foregoing , the Court will deny Petitioner 's Rule 59(e) Motion for \nReconsideration (D.I. 61) and the unrelated request to add Brandon Evans as a plaintiff (D.I. 63). \n3 The Court denied the Petition on June 28, 2021. (D.I 56; D.I. 57) Petitioner filed the instant \nMotion for Reconsideration (D.I. 61) on July 9, 2021, which was eleven days after the dismissal \nof his Petition. \n3 A separate Order will be entered. \nDATED: January 11, 2022 \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nMICHAEL EV ANS, \nPetitioner , \nV. \nKOLA WOLE AKINBA YO, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE , \nRespondents . Civil Action No. 18-1080-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 11th day of January, 2022; \nFor the reasons set forth in the Memorandum issued this date, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that: \n1.
