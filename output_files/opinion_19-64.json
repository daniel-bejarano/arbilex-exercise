Criminal Action No. 19-64-RGA\nLEOCADIO VALLARTA ISIP, JR.,\n\nDefendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nBefore me is Defendant Leocadio Vallarta Isip, Jr.\u2019s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea.\n(DI. 110). Ihave reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions. (D.I. 110, 124, 131, 134). Ihave also\nconsidered the evidence presented by both parties at the evidentiary hearing held on February 24\nand 25, 2022. (D.I. 145, 146). For the reasons stated below, Defendant\u2019s motion is denied.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn May 7, 2019, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Defendant with (1)\nReceipt and Attempted Receipt of Child Pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(2),\n2252(b)(1), and 2256(2)(A); (2) Travel with Intent to Engage in Illicit Sexual Conduct, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b); and (3) Engaging in Illicit Sexual Conduct in Foreign Places, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c). (D.I. 26). On February 10, 2020, Defendant pleaded guilty to\nCount One, receipt of child pornography. (D.I. 71, 73, 85). His plea was entered pursuant to a\nplea agreement Defendant had signed on February 7, 2020 and amended Attachment B which\n\nDefendant signed at the hearing on February 10, 2020. (D.I. 71, 73).\n\nOn October 7, 2020, Defendant filed a motion to continue the sentencing, raising for the\nfirst time that he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea, which he had first brought up with counsel\nfive months after the guilty plea. (D.I. 86 419; D.I. 145 at 18:24-19:4), In due course,\nDefendant filed a motion seeking to withdraw his guilty plea, contending that he is innocent and\nthat he did not make his plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. (See D.I. 89). After a\nchange in representation, and delay concerning new counsel\u2019s representation, counsel filed a new\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea. (See DJ. 110). After briefing and the evidentiary hearing,\nI now decide the motion.\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nA defendant may withdraw a guilty plea if he \u201ccan show a fair and just reason for\nrequesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fep. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B). The defendant bears the\n\u201csubstantial\u201d burden of demonstrating a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason. United States v. Jones, 336 F.3d\n245, 252 (3d Cir. 2003). A court must consider three factors in determining whether a \u201cfair and\njust\u201d reason exists: \u201c(1) whether the defendant asserts his innocence; (2) the strength of the\ndefendant\u2019s reasons for withdrawing the plea; and (3) whether the government would be\nprejudiced by the withdrawal.\u201d Jd No one factor is \u201cmandatory such that failure to establish\none will necessarily dictate rejection of the motion.\u201d United States v. Wilder, 134 F. App\u2019x 527,\n528 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\nIli. DISCUSSION\nA. Assertion of Innocence\n\u201cTo satisfy the first factor, a defendant must make a credible showing of innocence,\n\nsupported by a factual record.\u201d United States v. Lee, 664 F. App\u2019x 126, 128 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\n\u201cBald assertions of innocence are insufficient to permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.\u201d\nJones, 336 F.3d at 252. A defendant must offer \u201ccredible facts\u201d in support of his assertion. Id.\nat 253. In addition to asserting his innocence, a defendant must \u201cgive sufficient reasons to\nexplain why contradictory positions were taken before the district court.\u201d United States v.\nBrown, 250 F.3d 811, 818 (3d Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted).\n\nDefendant\u2019s guilty plea was originally predicated on the fact that Defendant knowingly\nreceived a sexually explicit picture from the victim via Facebook Messenger. (See D.I. 73). At\nthe Rule 11 change of plea hearing, however, Defendant questioned whether he knowingly\nreceived the picture because he did not open it. (D.I. 85 at 40:2-22). After taking a thirty-\nminute recess to review the evidence, the parties amended Attachment B (the statement of facts\nestablishing guilt) to instead provide that Defendant knowingly received a sexually explicit\nvideo. (Jd. at 43, 44:9-25). Defendant signed amended Attachment B. (D.I. 73; D.I. 85 at\n46:22-24). Defendant\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Huff, told the Court, \u201c[I]t was actually in [sic] my client\u2019s\nsuggestion that we change this language to cover a video that was sent as opposed to images.\u201d\n(D.I. 85 at 45:13-15). Defendant confirmed that he received and opened the video, and that he\nwas guilty. (d. at 45:16\u201425, 47:4~7).\n\nDefendant now contends, \u201c[H]e never downloaded, opened, viewed or played the video\nsent by the victim on November 14, 2015.\u201d (D.J. 110 at 8). He argues that at the hearing, \u201che\nwas unsute whether or not he had actually viewed the video. Since the guilty plea, however, he\nnow remembers that he had not viewed the video on November 14, 2015.\u201d Ud). Defendant\nasserts that he instead knew the contents of the video because (1) he received the video from\n\nChristopher Nalasa in May 2016 (id.; DL. 145 at 22:20-23:10 (testimony of Mr. Huff); D.I. 146\n\nat 306:20-307:11 (testimony of Defendant)), and (2) the victim told him the contents of the\nvideo she was sending in a telephone conversation. (D.I. 110 at 9-10).\n\nDefendant has not produced any credible evidence to support his current claims. See\nBrown, 250 F.3d at 818 (\u201cAssertions of innocence must be buttressed by facts in the record that\nsupport a claimed defense.\u201d (citation omitted)). Instead, the evidence directly contradicts\nDefendant\u2019s assertion of innocence. The victim sent Defendant the sexually explicit video\nthrough Facebook Messenger on November 14, 2015.! After receiving this video, Defendant\nmessaged the victim and mentioned specific details from the video indicating that he had opened\nand watched the video, For example, Defendant told the victim to use a smailer bottle and\nasked her why she was wearing a shirt in the video. (See D.I. 145 at 205:11-208:2 (testimony\nof Special Agent Downey)). These messages overwhelmingly support a finding that Defendant\nknowingly received this video on November 14, 2015.7\n\nDefendant\u2019s assertions of innocence also contradict his statements at the Rule 11 hearing.\nAfter the parties amended Attachment B, Defendant raised no objection to the Government\u2019s\nrecitation of the facts, and he admitted to knowingly receiving and opening the video. (D.I. 85\n\nat 44:9-46:24). He did not make any indication that he was \u201cunsure\u201d about whether he opened\n\n' This video was recovered from Defendant\u2019s phone during the forensic examination. (D.I. 145\nat 142:6~-147:10, 153:25-154:18, 182:16-183:11, 235:3-6 (testimony of Special Agent\nDowney); see also Exs. 6AA & 6BB).\n? Although the evidence here shows that Defendant opened and watched the video, I do note that\nDefendant can still be guilty of \u201cknowingly receiving\u201d child pornography without a showing that\nhe opened the file containing the child pornography. Even if Defendant only knew the contents\nof the video because of what the victim told him during a phone conversation, Defendant still\nknowingly received child pornography.\n\n4\n\nthe video? Defendant fails to credibly \u201cexplain why his position has changed so markedly\u201d\nsince the hearing. Jones, 336 F.3d at 253. Thus, I conclude that Defendant has not met his\nburden to make a credible showing of innocence.\nB. Strength of Reasons for Withdrawal\n\nTurning to the second factor, Defendant raises several arguments as to why his plea was\nnot made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. He first argues that he did not fully\nunderstand the terms of the plea agreement, as shown by his confusion at the Rule 11 hearing\nregarding fines, restitution, forfeiture, supervised release, the mandatory minimum sentence, and\nthe sentencing guidelines. (D.I. 110 at 10-12). Defendant asked several questions at the\nhearing, and the Court provided an explanation for each question. (See D.I. 85 at 13-17, 19-\n30). The Court also walked Defendant through the plea agreement, asking at each step whether\nDefendant understood. (/d. at 18-32). Defendant confirmed each time that he understood.\nUd.). Thus, I conclude that Defendant understood all the terms of the plea agreement.\n\nDefendant also argues that he did not fully understand the charge he was pleading guilty\nto because he did not understand the meaning of \u201cknowingly received.\u201d (D.I. 110 at 10).\nDefendant did express confusion as to the meaning of \u201cknowingly received\u201d before the parties\namended Attachment B. (See, e.g., D.I. 85 at 32:24-35:18, 40:2-42:22), He was not sure that\nhe \u201cknowingly received\u201d the sexually explicit picture because he never opened it. (Ud. at 40:2\u2014\n13). This confusion is why the parties requested the thirty-minute recess to amend Attachment\n\nB. (id. at 43). In fact, Defendant himself proposed changing the factual basis of the plea to his\n\n3 The lack of protest stands in stark contrast with all the other detailed concerns Defendant had,\nincluding whether the receipt of the sexually explicit picture (as opposed to the video) was\n\u201cknowing.\u201d\n\n5\n\nreceipt of the video. (/d. at 45:13~15). After the recess and the amendments to Attachment B,\nDefendant admitted to opening the video, and expressed no further confusion regarding\n\u201cknowingly received.\u201d (id. at 45:16-47:7). Thus, I conclude that a plain reading of the hearing\ntranscript shows that Defendant sufficiently understood what \u201cknowingly received\u201d meant.\n\nDefendant also contends that he did not have a clear understanding of the plea agreement\ndue to the \u201cnumerous changes\u201d made to Attachment B. (D.I.110 at 15). The parties only made\nlimited changes to Attachment B. They clarified the date of receipt and replaced all references\nto the picture with references to the video. (D.I. 73). Defendant suggested changing the basis\nof the plea to his receipt of the video, so he clearly understood the scope of the changes made to\nAttachment B.\n\nDefendant argues that he was \u201cbadgered\u201d into pleading guilty by AUSA Robinson, who\nrepeatedly approached Defendant and his attorney during the recess. (D.I. 110 at 9; D.L 146 at\n330:13-18 (testimony of Defendant)). This assertion is not supported by the record. Instead,\nthe record shows that Mr. Robinson approached the defense table to work with Defendant\u2019s\nattorney to amend Attachment B to include facts that Defendant would unreservedly admit to\nduring the guilty plea. (DI. 85 at 43:17~18; D.L. 145 at 25:10-15, 55:8-21, 56:19-25\n(testimony of Mr. Huff)).\n\nDefendant also appears to contend that he did not have a sufficient understanding of the\nplea agreement because English is not his native language. (D.I. 110 at 19). I find that\n\nDefendant\u2019s English was more than sufficient to understand his plea.*\n\n4 Before the guilty plea, I had seen Defendant testify in English at the suppression hearing.\n(D.1. 67). I have also seen him speak at various hearings where he wanted to terminate his\ncounsel\u2019s representation. He has no difficulty speaking and understanding English.\n\nAt the beginning of the plea hearing, Defendant stated that he spoke and understood\nEnglish. (D.I. 85 at 4-5). Although Defendant warned the Court that he might have trouble\nunderstanding if anyone spoke too fast, a full reading of the hearing transcript shows that\nDefendant did not have any difficulties understanding the proceedings. In fact, I\ncontemporaneously found, \u201c[H]e\u2019s very knowledgeable about what the evidence is in the case\nand asks very subtle questions about the evidence.\u201d (Jd. at 47:11-13). I do not think Defendant\nwould have been able to ask such detailed questions about the evidence if he could not\nsufficiently speak and understand English.\n\nA review of the complete transcript of the plea colloquy confirms that Defendant made a\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea.\n\nIn his next set of arguments, Defendant asserts that his former attorney Mr. Huff provided\nineffective assistance of counsel. \u201cA court will permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea\nbased on ineffective assistance of counsel only if (1) the defendant shows that his attorney\u2019s\nadvice was under all the circumstances unreasonable under prevailing professional norms, and\n(2) the defendant shows that he suffered \u2018sufficient prejudice\u2019 from his counsel\u2019s errors.\u201d Jones,\n336 F.3d at 253-54 (internal citations omitted). Defendant generally argues that Mr. Huff's\n\u201cacquiescence\u201d to the plea agreement was unreasonable. (D.I. 110 at 16). But Defendant does\nnot explain how Mr. Huff\u2019s acquiescence to a knowing and voluntary plea was \u201cunder all the\ncircumstances unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.\u201d5 Defendant\u2019s argument is\n\nnot a valid basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n> Lurking in the background to the plea was the possibility that the United States would charge\nDefendant with a fifteen-year minimum mandatory \u201cproduction charge\u201d if he did not take the\noffered plea. (D.I. 146 at 284:19-25 (issue raised when Defendant was represented by the\n\n7\nFor the first time, in Defendant\u2019s Reply, Defendant asserts that Mr. Huff was ineffective\nbecause he failed to file any motion to dismiss the indictment, which had at least three defects.\n(DL 131).\n\nFirst, Defendant argues that Count One\u2014receipt of child pornography\u2014is barred by the\nstatute of limitations. Defendant is incorrect.\u00ae\n\nThere is no statute of limitations for receipt of child pornography under \u00a7 2252, which\nis found in Chapter 110 of the United States Code. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3299, \u201can\nindictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without limitation .. . for any\nfelony under chapter . . . 110 (except for section 2257 and 2257A)....\u201d The cases cited by\nDefendant which applied the five-year statute of limitations to child pornography offenses are\ninapposite. Those cases involved conduct that occurred before Congress promulgated \u00a7 3299 in\nJuly 2006. See, e.g., United States v. Coutentos, 651 F.3d 809, 818 (8th Cir. 2011); United\nStates v. Burkhart, 602 F.3d 1202, 1206 (10th Cir. 2010); United States v. Welton, 2009 WL\n4507744, at *16 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2009). The conduct here occurred between 2014 and 2016,\nso there is no question that \u00a7 3299 applies. Accordingly, Mr. Huff was not ineffective for\nfailing to raise the inapplicable statute of limitations defense.\n\nSecond, Defendant argues that Count One of the indictment is duplicitous. \u201cDuplicity is\n\nthe improper combining of separate offenses into a single count.\u201d United States v. Steiner, 847\n\nAssistant Federal Public Defender, Janet Bateman); D.I. 145 at 48:22-49:8 (issue discussed\nwhen Defendant was represented by Mr. Huff)).\n6 The indictment was returned May 7, 2019. The time frame of the receipt of child pornography\nwas April 28, 2014 to September 25, 2016. All but the first ten days were within the purported\nfive-year statute of limitations. The conduct to which he pled guilty, on November 14, 2015,\nwas well within even a five-year statute of limitations.\n\n8\n\nF.3d 103, 114 Gd Cir. 2017). Count One charges Defendant with knowingly receiving child\npornography \u201c[f]rom on or about April 28, 2014, through on or about September 25, 2016.\u201d\n(D.I. 26 at 2). Defendant argues that Count One improperly charges many distinct crimes, as\neach individual receipt of child pornography is a separate offense. (D.[. 131 at 2-3). The\nGovernment responds that the indictment is not duplicitous because Defendant was engaged in a\n\u201ccontinuous course of conduct\u201d with respect to his receipt of child pornography. (D.I. 134 at 3\u2014\n7 (citing United States v. Root, 585 F.3d 145 (3d Cir. 2009))).\n\nWhile I think Defendant\u2019s duplicity argument probably has some merit as an academic\nmatter, I am confident that it was not unreasonable under prevailing professional norms not to\nfile a motion to dismiss for duplicity. Most defendants and defense counsel would prefer to face\nless rather than more charges, whether the charges are for drugs or for child pornography.\nFurther, Defendant has failed to show that he suffered any prejudice from Mr. Huff's failure to\nnotice the duplicity issue. Even if Defendant successfully moved to dismiss the indictment on\nduplicity grounds, there is no statute of limitations, so the Government could have simply\nseparated the charges and reindicted Defendant. The reindictment would instead subject\nDefendant to more charges for receipt of child pornography. See, e.g., United States v.\nGunselman, 643 F. App\u2019x 348, 353 (5th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (concluding that the defendant\n\u201ccould not have suffered any prejudice from his attorney\u2019s failure to spot the duplicity\u201d because\n\u201cthe government could simply have divided up the duplicitous counts and reindicted, thus\nsubjecting [the defendant] to more charges\u201d). Thus, Defendant has failed to show ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel based on duplicity grounds.\n\nThird, Defendant argues that Counts Two and Three of the indictment are defective.\nCount Two provides, \u201cFrom on or about May 14, 2014, through on or about June 24, 2014,\n[Defendant] knowingly travelled in foreign commerce . . . to the Philippines, for the purpose of\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2423(f),\nwith Minor A, a girl less than 18 years of age, in violation of Title 18, United States Code,\nSection 2423(b).\u201d (DI. 26 at 2-3). Similarly, Count Three provides, \u201cFrom on or about May\n14, 2014, through on or about June 24, 2014, [Defendant] knowingly travelled in foreign\ncommerce ... to the Philippines, and engaged in illicit sexual conduct, as defined in Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(f), with Minor A, a girl less than 18 years of age, in violation\nof Title 18, United States Code, Section 2423(c).\u201d (Ud. at 3).\n\nSection 2423 defines \u201cillicit sexual conduct\u201d as \u201ca sexual act (as defined in section 2246)\nwith a person under 18 years of age that would be in violation of chapter 109A.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2423(f). Section 2243 (in chapter 109A) prohibits engaging in a sexual act with a person under\n16 years old. Jd. \u00a7 2243(a). If the victim is between 16 and 18 years old, a defendant can only\nbe charged under chapter 109A if the defendant used force. See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2242; United\nStates vy. Murphy, 942 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir. 2019). Defendant argues that because Counts Two\nand Three only allege that the victim was under 18 years old, rather than under 16 years old, they\nfail to charge an offense. (D.I. 131 at 3-4).\n\nThe Government responds that the indictment tracks the language of the statute, which\ndefines illicit sexual conduct as a sexual act \u201cwith a person under 18 years of age.\u201d (D.L. 134 at\n8). The Government further argues that Defendant\u2019s conduct falls within \u00a7 2243(a) because the\n\nvictim was 15 years old when Defendant travelled to the Philippines to have sex with her. (/d.).\n\n10\n\nAn indictment is generally deemed sufficient if it: \u201c(1) contains the elements of the\noffense intended to be charged, (2) sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be\nprepared to meet, and (3) allows the defendant to show with accuracy to what extent he may\nplead a former acquittal or conviction in the event of a subsequent prosecution.\u201d United States\nvy, Kemp, 500 F.3d 257, 280 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 321\n(3d Cir. 2007)). \u201c[N]o greater specificity than the statutory language is required so long as there\nis sufficient factual orientation to permit the defendant to prepare his defense and to invoke\ndouble jeopardy in the event of a subsequent prosecution.\u201d Jd. (quoting United States v. Rankin,\n870 F.2d 109, 112 (3d Cir. 1989)).\n\nTo establish a violation of \u00a7 2423(b), the Government must show: (1) Defendant travelled\nin foreign commerce; and (2) he intended to engage in \u201cillicit sexual conduct,\u201d i.e., a sexual act\nwith (a) a victim under 18 years old (b) in violation of chapter 109A. Similarly, to establish a\nviolation of \u00a7 2423(c), the Government must show: (1) Defendant travelled in foreign commerce;\nand (2) he engaged in \u201cillicit sexual conduct,\u201d i.e., a sexual act with (a) a victim under 18 years\nold (b) in violation of chapter 109A.\n\nCounts Two and Three track the language of \u00a7 2423(b) and (c), respectively. (See D.I.\n26 at 2-3). Although these counts do not include the phrase \u201cin violation of chapter 109A,\u201d\nthey do refer to the definitional section of the statute, \u00a7 2423(f), which includes this requirement.\nThus, the indictment contains each element of the charged offenses and sufficiently apprises\nDefendant of what he must be prepared to meet. The indictment does not need to allege that the\nvictim was under 16 years old to adequately charge an offense. Counts Two and Three are\n\nsufficient. See, e.g., United States v. Kalkounos, 2006 WL 2076587, at *1-*3 (E.D. Wis. July\n\n11\n\n24, 2006) (holding that an indictment was sufficient where it provided, \u201c[Defendant] traveled in\ninterstate commerce from Illinois to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the purpose of engaging in any\nsexual act, as defined by Title 18, Unite[d] States Code, Section 2246(2), with a person under 18\nyears of age, and which conduct would be illegal under federal law. All in violation of Title 18,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b).\u201d). Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s attorney was not ineffective\nfor failing to move to dismiss the indictment on this ground.\u2019\nC. Prejudice to the Government\n\n\u201c(T]he Government need not show such prejudice when a defendant has failed to\ndemonstrate that the other factors support a withdrawal of the plea.\u201d Jones, 336 F.3d at 255.\nBecause Defendant has failed to make a credible showing of innocence and has failed to offer\nstrong reasons for withdrawing his plea, the Court does not need to consider the third factor.\u00ae\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nThus, I conclude that Defendant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a fair and\n\njust reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. Defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea is\n\n7 Indeed, it would also be hard to say that there was any prejudice to Defendant even had counsel\nsuccessfully moved for dismissal on this ground. Defendant did not plead guilty to either\nCounts Two or Three, And, the Government could surely have obtained another indictment\nwith the age of the victim specified had that been required.\n8 If it were important to consider it, I would find the Government has not shown sufficient\nprejudice. The only argument of the Government was that they had lost touch with the victim\nafter the guilty plea. It is at best speculative whether further efforts to contact the victim would\nhave been fruitless, or what the victim\u2019s wishes would have been about further assistance in the\nprosecution were the guilty plea to be withdrawn.\n\n12\n\ndenied.\n\nAn appropriate order will issue.\n\nEntered this a day of April, 2022.\n\nUnited States\n\n13\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nv.
