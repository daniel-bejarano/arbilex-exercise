Andrews", "date": "11-18-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nRSB SPINE, LLC, \nPlaintiff \nV. \nDEPUY SYNTHES SALES, INC., and \nDEPUY SYNTHES PRODUCTS, INC, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 19-1515-RGA \nMEMORAND UM ORDER ON PARTIES' MOTIONS TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY \nBefore me are Defendants ' Daubert Motion to Exclude Certain Opinions and Testimon y \nof Damages Expert Douglas Kidder (D.I. 171) and Plaintiffs Daubert Motion to Exclude Expert \nOpinions . (D.I. 176). I have considered the parties' briefing on each motion (D.I. 172, 190, 201; \nD.I. 177, 186, 198). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants ' motion is DENIED , and \nPlaintiffs motion is DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff RSB Spine (\"RSB\") asserts two patents against Defendants DePuy Synthes \nSales and DePuy Synthes Products (collectively, \"DePuy\"). These patents concern spinal implant \ndevices used in spinal fusion surgeries . (D.I. 172 at 2). DePuy asserts counterclaims of invalidity \nand non-infringement , and, in the alternative, interference between one of DePuy's own patents \nand the asserted patents. (D.I. 41). RSB is not seeking lost profits. (D.I. 173 Ex. A at 17). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 sets out the requirements for expert witness testimony and \nstates: A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge , skill, \nexperience, training, or education may testify in the form of an \nopinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's scientific , technical, or other \nspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the \nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based \non sufficient facts or data; ( c) the testimony is the product of reliable \nprinciples and methods; and ( d) the expert has reliably applied the \nprinciples and methods to the facts of the case. \nFed. R. Evid. 702. The Third Circuit has explained: \n[T]he district court acts as a gatekeeper , preventing op1Il1on \ntestimony that does not meet the requirements of qualification , \nreliability and fit from reaching the jury. See Daubert (\"Faced with \na proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must \ndetermine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a) [of the Federal \nRules of Evidence] whether the expert is proposing to testify to ( 1) \nscientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand \nor determine a fact in issue.\"). \nSchneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, 320 F.3d 396, 404-05 (3d Cir. 2003) (footnote \nand internal citations omitted). 1 Qualification examines the expert's specialized knowledge , \nreliability examines the grounds for the expert's opinion, and fit examines whether the testimony \nis relevant and will \"assist the trier of fact.\" Id. at 404. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Defendants' Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony \nDefendants move to exclude opinions by Plaintiff's damages expert, Mr. Douglas Kidder, \non two grounds. First, Defendants argue that Mr. Kidder failed to apportion his reasonable \nroyalty calculation. (D.I. 172 at 6). Second, Defendants contend that Mr. Kidder did not account \nfor the negotiation aspect of a hypothetical negotiation in determining the reasonable royalty. (Id. \nat 12-13). I find that Mr. Kidder's opinion sufficiently addresses apportionment and negotiation. \n1 The Court of Appeals wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent \namendments to it were not intended to make any substantive change. Defendants' objections to his conclusions only raise factual issues that can be addressed by cross \nexamination. \n1. Failure to Apportion \nMr. Kidder calculated his proposed reasonable royalty based on the first Georgia-Pacific \nfactor, \"royalties received by the patentee for the licensing of the patent in suit.\" Georgia-Pacific \nCorp. v. United States Plywood Corp., 318 F. Supp. 1116, 1120 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). He examined \nagreements (the \"License Agreements\") between Plaintiff and three other spinal implant \ncompanies (the \"Licensees\"). (D.I. 173 Ex. A, 58). Two agreements (with Xtant and Life Spine) \nsettled litigation over the same patents asserted here, while the third (with Zimmer) alludes to a \ndispute but no lawsuit. Id. ,, 74, 82, 87. Those agreements provided for \"headline\" royalty rates \nof 5% or 6%, reduced by additional licensee-specific discounts. Mr. Kidder finds that since \nDePuy would not qualify for the discounts offered to the Licensees, 6% would be a reasonable \nroyalty. Id. , 58. \nDePuy argues that Mr. Kidder failed to apportion this reasonable royalty in two ways: \nfirst, by not explicitly valuing the asserted patents relative to DePuy's own contribution to its \nproducts, and second, by not accounting for the fact that license agreements upon which he based \nhis rates include other patents. (D.I. 172 at 6). Plaintiff argues that apportionment is properly \n\"built in\" to the 6% rate, since the License Agreements concern the same patents and similar \nproducts. (D.I. 190 at 2). Plaintiff also notes that while the License Agreements do include other \npatents, Mr. Kidder considered these patents and determined that their inclusion did not affect \nthe agreed-upon rates. (D.I. 190 at 8). \nThe \"ultimate reasonable royalty award must be based on the incremental value that the \npatented invention adds to the end product.\" Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The Federal Circuit has instructed that district courts, as gatekeepers , \nshould \"ensure that only theories comporting with settled principles of apportionment [are] \nallowed to reach the jury.\" VirnetX, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., 767 F.3d 1308, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2014). \nWhen, as here, an expert \"[relies] on licenses to prove a reasonable royalty, alleging a loose or \nvague comparability between different technologies or licenses does not suffice.\" Laser \nDynamics , Inc. v. Quanta Comput., Inc., 694 F.3d 51, 79 (Fed. Cir. 2012). However , \"the degree \nof comparability of the ... license agreements as well as any failure ... to control for certain \nvariables are factual issues best addressed by cross examination and not by exclusion.\" \nActive Video Networks, Inc. v. Verizon Commun s., Inc., 694 F.3d 1312, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \nBoth Defendants and Plaintiff cite Bio-Rad Labs., Inc. v. 1 OX Genomic s, Inc., 2018 WL \n4691047 (D. Del. Sept. 28, 2018), in which I found that a separate apportionment analysis would \nnot always be necessary , but that one of the experts had nonetheless failed to sufficiently \napportion the royalty. Specifically , there would need to be \"a logical basis\" for not conducting an \napportionment analysis. Id. at *7. The expert in that case later did provide a sufficient logical \nbasis. Bio-Rad Labs., Inc. v. JOXGenomic s, Inc., 2018 WL 5729732, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 2, \n2018), aff'd in relevant part, 967 F.3d 1353, 1372-77 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \nMr. Kidder has clearly stated why the licenses are comparable: RSB had asserted the \nsame patents against two of the Licensees , the licenses are also for spinal implant products, and \nthe Licensees are Defendants ' competitors . (D.I. 190 at 2, 5). This is in contrast with Bio-Rad, \nwhere there was reason to think that the patented technology did not play the same role in the \nlicensed products as in the accused products. Bio-Rad, 2018 WL 4691047 at *8 n. 3. Mr. Kidder \nalso addresses the additional licensed patents and provides reasoning for why he does not think \nthey impact his overall calculation. (D.I. 173 Ex. A ,r 96). Further exploration of the similarities or differences between Defendants and Licensees is a factual, rather than methodological , \nexercise and can be addressed on cross examination. \n2. Hypothetical Negotiation \nDefendants argue that Mr. Kidder's arrived-at rate is simply where RSB would have \nstarted its hypothetical negotiation , and that Mr. Kidder thus \"improperly assumed a one-sided \nnegotiation.\" In re Koninklijke Philips Patent Litig., 2020 WL 7398647, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Apr. \n13, 2020). Plaintiff counters that Mr. Kidder compared DePuy's negotiating position to those of \nthe licensees and concluded that they were \"similarly situated.\" (D.I. 173 Ex. A at 50). He also \nobserved that DePuy would not qualify for any of the discounts granted to the licensees. (D.I. \n190 at 8-9). \nI agree with Plaintiff. The expert in In re Koninklijke Philips used advertised licensing \nrates, which would clearly be one-sided and not negotiated . 2020 WL 7398647 at *9. The \nheadline rates from RSB' s License Agreements , although not final paid rates, are nevertheless \nthe product of negotiation. The fact that the Xtant agreement has a lower rate than the Life Spine \nand Zimmer agreements supports this. (D.I. 173 Ex. A at 29 Table 6). Mr. Kidder reasonably \nasserts that DePuy has a similar baseline bargaining power to the Licensees , but without any of \nthe advantages that would lead to further discounts. A factual question may well exist as to \nwhether DePuy truly would not have qualified for some additional discount, but, again, such a \nfactual issue should be addressed on cross examination. \nB. Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Expert Opinions \nPlaintiff moves to exclude certain opinions of Defendants ' technical expert, Dr. Boyle C. \nCheng, as well as those opinions of Defendants ' damages expert, Mr. Kevin McElroy, that are \nderived from Dr. Cheng's opinions. Plaintiff argues that Dr. Cheng offers opinions regarding the term \"lip osteophyte \" that contradict the court's claim construction , and that Dr. Cheng presents \ncertain of Defendants ' products as \"non-infringing alternativ es\" without sufficient proof. Mr. \nMcElroy references these products in his reasonable royalty analysis. \nFirst, I find that Dr. Cheng's usage of \"lip osteophyte \" is permitted by my claim \nconstruction. Second, I find that because Plaintiff is not seeking lost profits, Dr. Cheng provides \nsufficient support for his identification of DePuy' s products as alternatives to the accused \nproducts. \n1. Opinions Regarding \"lip osteophytes\" \nI construed \"lip osteophyte\" to mean \"bony outgrowth at the lip.\" (D.I. 123 at 9). Dr. \nCheng employs my construction in his Non-Infringement Report, responding to Plaintiff's expert \nDr. Hynes's Infringement Report. In his report, Dr. Cheng asserts that each of Defendants ' \ndevices \"does not include a bone screw hole that opens toward a lip osteophyte \" because lip \nosteophytes \"would be located on the outer surface of the bone.\" (D.I. 178 Ex. K ,r,r 87, 114, 164, \n197,230) . \nPlaintiff argues that by insisting an osteophyte must be \"on the outer surface,\" Dr. Cheng \nis narrowing my construction. (D.I. 177 at 37). According to Plaintiff, a requirement that the \nosteophyte be \"on the outer surface\" would prevent the osteophyte from \"shar[ing] or includ[ing] \na portion of the two-dimensional side surface\"-an attribute I specificall y allowed for in \nconstruing the term. (D.I. 123 at 10). Defendants argue that Dr. Cheng's usage follows naturally \nfrom the definition of the vertebral \"lip,\" and that an osteophyte must grow outward since it is \nconstrued to be an \"outgrowth. \" (D.I. 186 at 34-35). \nExpert testimony that contradicts the Court's claim construction should be excluded. \nMinerva Surgical, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc., 2021 WL 3048447, at *9 (D. Del. July 20, 2021). However , as Plaintiff itself notes in its response to Defendants ' Motion for Summary Judgment \n(D .I. 190 at 19), experts disagreeing about how a construction should be applied to a given case \nis a factual dispute for the jury. Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 632 F.3d 1292, 1301-02 \n(Fed. Cir. 2011). Here, Dr. Cheng seems to use my construction properly. Differences between \nhis usage and Plaintiff's expert's usage amount to disagreements about what a person of ordinary \nskill would consider to be the vertebral \"lip,\" and how outgrowths from that area could be \nshaped. These are factual disputes. \n2. Opinions Regarding Non-Infringing Alternatives \nDr. Cheng opines that some of Defendants ' other products would have served as \nalternatives to the accused products. (D.I. 178 Ex. K ,r,r 245-52). Mr. McElroy then refers to the \nimpact these products would have had on a hypothetical negotiation between the parties in his \nrebuttal to Mr. Kidder's report. (D.I. 178 Ex. M ,r,r 16, 74, 137, 151, 162 n. 234). \nPlaintiff argues that Grain Processing Corp. v. American Maize-Products Co., 185 F.3d \n1341 (Fed. Cir. 1999), requires Defendants to meet a particular burden of proof when asserting \nthat a product is a non-infringing alternative. (D.I. 177 at 38). Defendants point out that, as \nPlaintiff is not seeking lost profits, no such burden is applicable. (D.I. 186 at 37). \nI agree with Defendants. Grain Processing concerns whether a court properly denied a \nplaintiff lost profits. 185 F.3d at 1343. Plaintiff cites no case law that indicates any burden of \nproof when considering alternative products for a reasonable royalty analysis under the Georgia\u00ad\nPacific factors. The existence of alternative products may affect some of the fifteen factors, but \nthe entire possibility of an award does not turn on the alternative 's existence. Plaintiff may \ncertainly cross-examine both Dr. Cheng and Mr. McElroy on the strength of their factual findings that DePuy's other products would have influenced the royalty negotiations, but I see no \nreason to exclude Dr. Cheng's opinions. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n~ \nEntered this f 8' day of November , 2022 \nstrict Judge "}
