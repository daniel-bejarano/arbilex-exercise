(D.I. 58).  Plaintiff A pril Molchan \n(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cMolchan\u201d)  opposes the motion.  (D.I. 62).  For the reasons set forth below, \nDefendant\u2019s motion is DENIED -IN-PART and GRANTED- IN-PART . \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff was a volunteer member with Delmar FD starting in 2009, and she was a paid \nemployee of Delmar FD from 2009 to December 27, 2018.  ( See D.I. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 2 & 15 -16).  At the \ncore of this matter is the behavior of Andrew Rementer (\u201cRementer\u201d), a former defendant to this \nlawsuit.   (See D.I. 6 & D.I. 25).1  Plaintiff claims that Rementer had a history of making \n\u201csuggesti ve comments and employ[ing] sexual innuendo in conversation\u201d with her and other \nfemale Delmar FD members and employees.  (D.I. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 17 & 19 & 24- 26).  On September 8, \n2015, Rementer \u2013 who w as then Fire Chief \u2013 and Plaintiff, along with two other Delmar FD  \nofficer s, were returning from a meeting in Dover when they stopped for lunch in Greenwood.  ( Id. \n\u00b6 27).  At that lunch, Rementer purportedly placed his hand on the inside of Plaintiff\u2019s thi gh and \nPlaintiff \u201cimmediately and forcefully told him to remove his  hand.\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 28.).  Rementer \ncomplied.  ( Id.).  Nearly two years later, on July 30, 2017, while Plaintiff was on duty as a paid \nDelmar FD employee, Rementer \u2013 who was then President and Second Assistant Chief of the \nDelmar FD \u2013 placed his hand on Plaint iff\u2019s b uttocks while walking behind her.  ( Id. \u00b6 29).  Plaintiff \nreacted and Rementer replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re paid today not volunteer.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 \n31).  Surveillance vide o captured the incident.  ( Id. \u00b6 30).  \n \n1  When Plaintiff filed her Amended Complaint (D .I. 25), she removed Rementer as a named \ndefendant.  2 On August 20, 2017, Plaintif f sent a complaint letter regarding Rementer to the Delmar FD \nEmployment Committee Chair and the Fire Chief.  ( Id. \u00b6 42).  That same day, prior to a Delmar \nFD membership meeting, the members hip allegedly asked Rementer to resign as President.  ( Id. \n\u00b6 48).  At the meeting, the membership announced that an employee had filed a complaint against \nRementer.  ( Id. \u00b6 51).  Subsequently, the membership announced that Rementer was suspended \nfor thirty  days or until an investigation into a complaint of \u201cimproper conduct\u201d against him \nconcluded.  ( Id. \u00b6 53).  Further, the membership mandated that he attend sexual harassment \ntraining.  (D.I. 62- 3 (Johnson Dep.) at 51:19- 52:1). \nShortly after the Delmar FD m embership meeting, on August 25, 2017, Plaintiff submitted \na compl aint to the Delaware Department of Labor (\u201cthe Delaware DOL\u201d).  (D.I. 25 \u00b6 46).  Then, \non August 28, 2017, Plaintiff attended a meeting with the Delmar FD House Committee (\u201cthe \nHouse Committee\u201d).  ( Id. \u00b6 58).  The House Committee asked her about her relati onship w ith \nRementer, why she filed a formal complaint, and whether there had been other occasions when \nRementer made her uncomfortable.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 58 & 64- 65).  Plaintiff alleges that this qu estioning \nwas \u201chostile, intrusive, discriminatory, defamatory, and accusat ory.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 64).  \nAt the next Delmar FD membership meeting on September 6, 2017, the House Committee \npermitted Rementer to attend despite his suspension.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 66 -69).  Plaintiff  asserts that her wish \nto be separate from Rementer and to keep th e situat ion confidential was violated, as more than \nfifty members were present, \u201c[n]o effort was made to protect Molchan\u2019s privacy or withhold her identity as the complainant,\u201d and her name, complaint letter, and account of the harassment were \nread aloud.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67 & 72- 74).  The meeting included a discussion of Plaintiff\u2019s complaint \nagainst Rementer and the corresponding investigation.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 71 -76). 3 Based on the surveillance footage available, the House Committee concluded that \n\u201cRementer had indeed  touched Molchan\u2019s buttocks as Molchan had alleged.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 76).  The \nHouse Committee recommended that Rementer be expelled.  ( Id. \u00b6 77).  Rementer admitted that \nhe \u201cdid it,\u201d but then \u201cwent  on a tirade against\u201d Plaintiff, claiming that her complaint was r etaliation \nfor a prior disagreement.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 79 -80).  Plaintiff denied this claim.  ( Id. \u00b6 82).  On \nSeptember  18, 2017, the House Committee questioned Rementer about previous complaints of \ninappropriate touching by other female Delmar FD members; at least  one ins tance was confirmed \nby the Fire Chief.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 86 -87 & 91- 96).  The House Committee\u2019s recommendation to expel \nRementer from the Delmar FD received a simple majority of votes.  ( Id. \u00b6 101).  The House \nCommittee did not expel Rementer because the by laws req uired a \u201cthird offense\u201d and a two -thirds \nmajority vote.  ( Id.).  Rementer resigned as President and Second Assistant Chief but, about a \nmonth later, was appointed as Engineer, a lead ership position within the organization.  ( See id.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 102 & 104- 05). \nIn De cember of 2017, the House Committee amended several of its bylaws, one of which \nmandated that individuals choose between volunteer or employee status.  (D.I. 58 \u00b6\u00b6 21 & 23).  \nThe bylaws allowed for amendments at only two points in the year: June and Decemb er.  ( See \nD.I. 58 \u00b6 22; D.I. 58- 2 at Ex. 5 Art. X, \u00a7 2; D.I. 62- 3 (Johnson Dep.) at 18:3- 5; D.I. 62- 5 (Abbott \nDep.) at 28:2- 5).  The relevant amendment stated: \u201cAny member, Life, Active, Honorary, or \nFire/EMS Associate may not work and collect mone y from t he Delmar Fire Department.  Members \nwho want to apply for employment must first resign before submitting the application.\u201d  (D.I. 58 \u00b6 23; D.I. 58 -2 at Ex. 6  \u00b6 7).  The amendment\u2019 s purpose was \u201cthe avoidance of wage and hour \nissues by preventing a s ituatio n in which a volunteer member claims he or she was actually \nworking and is due wages or precluding a volunteer member from getting a cash award from the 4 state for volunteering, while also being paid by the volunteer fire company to work.\u201d  ( D.I. 58- 2 \nat Ex. 6 \u00b6 8).  This change was an ongoing discussion amongst the membership; Keith Abbott \n(\u201cAbbott\u201d), the Employee Chair, stated: \u201cI knew there had been some talk before about the legality \nof volunteering, getting a LOSAP  [length of service award progr am] check from the state and \ngetting a paycheck from the department. I wasn\u2019t surprised it was coming.\u201d  ( D.I. 62-5 (Abbott \nDep.) at 34:19- 21 & 35:1).  The amendment, at that time, applie d to three individuals:  Plaintiff, \nAbbott himself , and Roland Morris , and it also  \u201cimpacted all members of DFD, current and new.\u201d  \n(D.I. 58 at 13; D.I. 58- 2 at Exs. 15- 16).  The parties dispute whether the House Committee notified \nPlaintiff of this change and her need to act.  (D.I. 58 \u00b6 25; D.I. 25 \u00b6  112).  Defendant provi ded \nExhi bit 15, a series of text messages, that appear to have informally notified Plaintiff.  ( D.I. 58- 2 \nat Ex. 15).  According to Defendant, Plaintiff did not choose one role or the other.  (D.I. 58 \u00b6 25; \nD.I. 58- 2 at Ex. 15).  \nOn October 3, 2017, Molcha n worked with counsel and the Delaware DOL to draft the first \nCharge of Discrimination.  (D.I. 25 \u00b6 114).  Oct ober 10, 2017, the Delaware DOL sent Delmar FD \nnotice of a Charge of Discrimination on behalf of Plaintiff.  ( Id. \u00b6 115).  Plaintiff received \npreliminary f indings on or about December 21, 2017.  ( Id. \u00b6 116).  On December 27, 2017, Plaintiff \nwas removed fro m the work schedule, her previously scheduled shifts were cancelled, and she was \napparently removed from the payroll as well.  ( Id. \u00b6 108).  Plaint iff asse rts that the bylaw \namendment was therefore \u201csimply a pretext to terminate [her] and which, on knowledge and belief, has not been applied to any other member.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 111).  She further claims that one of the other \nindividuals, whom she does not na me, was permitted to keep both his membership and his \nemployment.  ( Id. \u00b6 113).  An email from Abbott to anot her employee, dated January 17, 2018, 5 stated the following:  \u201cRemove Roland Morris from the payroll. Remove April Molchan from the \npayroll. Remove  Keith Ab bott from the payroll .\u201d  (D.I. 58- 2 at Ex. 16).  \nOn or about January 19, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a s econd complaint to the Delaware \nDOL, alleging retaliation.  (D.I. 25 \u00b6 119).  Delmar FD filed a response on February 12, 2018, which was deemed unt imely .  (Id. \u00b6 120).  In its response, Delmar FD admitted that Rementer \ntouched Plaintiff\u2019s buttocks and that  his actions were \u201cinappropriate and warranted expulsion.\u201d  \n(Id. \u00b6 122).  On May 12, 2018, the Delaware DOL sent Delmar FD  a notice of the second C harge \nof D iscrimination.  ( Id. \u00b6 125).  Delmar FD filed its response on June 1, 2018, denying that \nremoving Pla intiff from the payroll was retaliatory.  ( Id. \u00b6 126).  Plaintiff received notices of her \nright to sue from the Delaware DOL on October 17, 2018 and from t he U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission on November 28, 2018.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 127 -28).  Plaintiff al leges that she \nexhausted her administrative remedies.  ( Id. \u00b6 11).  \nPlaintiff filed this action on January 15, 2019, claiming that Delmar FD, Rem enter, and the \ntown of Delmar wrongfully discriminated against her in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights  \nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. , and the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act \n(\u201cDDEA\u201d), 19 Del. C. \u00a7 710 et seq.   (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 130 -31).  Plaintiff  also asserted claims for intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, defamation  and battery.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 160 -76).  On February 19, 2019, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint that removed \nthe town of  Delmar as a defendant but otherwise left the allegations and claims against Delmar FD \nand Rementer unchanged.  ( See D.I. 6).  On March 4, 2019, Delmar FD and Rementer  filed a \nmotion to dismiss, arguing that the First Amended Complaint failed to plausibl y allege \ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII or the DDEA based on either a hostile work environment \nclaim or retaliation.  ( See D.I. 9).  Delmar FD and Rementer  also sought dismissal of the emotional 6 distress claims as insufficiently pleaded and barre d by the D elaware Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, \nas well as dismissal of the battery claims as insufficiently pleaded.  ( Id.).  On January 17, 2020, \nthis Court granted th e motion and gave Plaintiff leave to amend.  ( See D.I. 23). \nOn February 4, 2020, Plaintiff  filed her  Second Amended Complaint, removing Rementer \nas a defendant and expanding upon the preexisting allegations and claims made in the First \nAmended Complaint.  ( See D.I. 25).  On February 18, 2020, Delmar FD moved to dismiss the \nSecond Amended Compla int and to strike the new allegations.  ( See D.I. 27).  On August 27, 2020, \nthe Court conducted a telephonic hearing on the motions, granting the motion to dismiss as  to the \ntort claims, but denying the motion as to the sexual harassment and retaliation cl aims under  Title \nVII and the DDEA.  (See Minute Entry for Telephonic Hearing held on 8/26/2020).   The Court \nalso granted -in-part and denied -in-part the motion to strike.  ( Id.).     \nThe parties conducted and completed discovery.  On June 24, 2021, Defendant  filed its \nmotion for summary judgment.  ( See D.I. 58) .  Plaintiff filed an Amended Answering Brief in \nOpposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on July 28, 2021.  ( See D.I. 62).  Along \nwith her Answering Brief, Plaintiff submitted multiple de clarations  from individuals affiliated with \nDefendant who detailed their experiences with Rementer\u2019s behavior.  (D.I. 62, Exs. H , I, J & K).  \nThen, on August 9, 2021, Defendant filed its Reply Brief.  ( See D.I. 63).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cThe court shall gran t summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \nissue of dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of la w.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The moving party bears the burden \u201cof demonstrating the absence of  a \ngenuine  issue of material fact.\u201d  See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. \n574, 585 n.10 (1986).  A party asserting that a fact cannot be \u2013 or, alternatively, is \u2013 genuinely 7 disputed must support its assertion either by citing to \u201c particula r parts of materials in the record, \nincluding depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, \nstipulations (including those made for the purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or ot her materi als\u201d or \u201cby showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence \nor presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce adm issible evidence to \nsupport the fact.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(1)(A) -(B).  If the moving party ha s carried  its burden, the \nnonmovant must then \u201ccome forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.\u201d  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 ( internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).  The \nCourt must \u201cdraw all reasonable i nferences  in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make \ncredibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., \n530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).   \nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non- moving party \u201cmust p resent mor e than \njust bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue.\u201d  Podobnik v. U.S. Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \u201cmere existence of some  alleged  factual d ispute between the parties will not defeat an \notherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d a factual dispute is genuine only where \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d  \nAnders on v. Libe rty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247- 48 (1986) (emphasis in original).  \u201cIf the \nevidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d  Id.  at 249 -50 (internal citations omitted).  Thus, the \u201cmere existen ce of a sc intilla of \nevidence\u201d in support of the nonmoving party\u2019s position is insufficient to defeat a motion for \nsummary judgment.  Id.  at 252. 8 III. DISCUSSION  \nIn the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant unlawfully \ndiscriminated aga inst her i n violation of Title VII, as well as in violation of the DDEA, the \nDelaware counterpart to Title VII.2  (D.I. 25 \u00b6  130).  Specifically, Plaintiff claims that she was \nsubjected to sexual harassment from Rementer and discrimination by Defendant, whi ch created a \nhostile work environment, and that her removal was retaliation for filing a complaint.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 132-\n35).  The Court will address the hostile work environment and retaliation claims  in turn. \nA. Plaintiff\u2019s Hostile Work Environment Claim  \n\u201cTitle  VII prohi bits sexual harassment that is \u2018sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the \nconditions of [the plaintiff\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d  Mandel \nv. M & Q Packing Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013)  (quoting Merito r Sav. Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) ).  A hostile work environment is one that \u201ccan and often will detract \nfrom employees\u2019 job perfor mance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them \nfrom advancing in their careers.\u201d  Harris v. Forkli ft Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993).  To prove \nthat acts of sexual harassment created a hostile working environment, a plaintiff must e stablish the \nfollowing:  \n(1) The employee suffered intentional discrimination because of his/her sex;  \n(2) The di scrimina tion was severe or pervasive;  \n(3) The discrimination detrimentally affected the plaintiff; \n \n2  The DDEA largely resembl es Title  VII in its goals and protections; the Court will therefore \naddress thes e federal and state claims together und er the Title VII framework.  See, e.g. , \nHyland v. Smyrna Sch. Dist., 608 F. App\u2019x 79, 82 n.4 (3d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[T]he evidence \nneeded to pr evail u nder the DDEA is generally the s ame as that needed to prevail under \nTitle  VII.  Accordingly, because Hyland\u2019s Title VII claim s fail, her DDEA claims fail, \ntoo.\u201d). 9 (4) The discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like \ncircumstances; and  \n (5) The existence of respondeat superior  liability.  \n \nMande l, 706 F.3d at 167.  To determine whether a workplace is a hostile environment, a court \nmust review all available evidence, including \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its \nseverity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mer e offensiv e utterance; and \nwhether it unreasonably interfe res with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d  Harris, 510 U.S. at  23. \nHere, Plaintiff alleges that the sexual harassment she experienced \u201cwas the result of a \nworkplace that was permeated with \u2018discrimina tory int imidation, ridicule, and insult,\u2019 which in \nthis case proved to be \u2018sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 25 \u00b6  142).  She support s her \nclaims  with th e 2015 inc ident described in her Second Amended Complaint and \u201cme too\u201d \nevidence, in the form of declarations from  other women having been harassed by Rementer  or \nhaving witnessed him harassing others .  (See D.I. 62 \u00b6\u00b6 3 -4).  In Defendant\u2019s view, Plaintiff \u2019s \nevidence  fails to show \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d discrimination because such a showing cannot be \nsupported by \u201cisolated incidents\u201d  or the \u201cme too\u201d evidence submitted  here.     \nAccording to the Supreme Court, \u201cme too\u201d evidence is neither \u201c per se admissible or pe r se \ninadmissible.\u201d  Sprint/United Mgmt. Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U.S. 379, 388 (2008).  The \ndetermination of the relevance of this evidence \u201cis fact based and depends on several factors, \nincluding how closely related the evidence is to the plaintiff\u2019s cir cumstances  and theory of the \ncase.\u201d  Mandel , 706 F .3d at 167.  Here, the Court is persuaded that at least some of the offered \n\u201cme too\u201d evidence is relevan t, at least because several declarants appear to have experienced or \nwitnessed Rementer\u2019s harassment  and suggest  that Delmar FD was aware of repeated in stances of \nit.  Some of the evidence also suggests that Rementer\u2019s conduct was well -known within the fire 10 department and thus may bear on whether Plaintiff subjectively perceived the environment to be \nabusi ve.  And f inding that, the Court is persuaded that genuine issues of material fact exist that \npreclude summary judgment of Plaintiff\u2019s hostile work environment claim.   \nB. Plaintiff\u2019s Retaliation Claim  \nTitle VII provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful emp loyme nt pr actice for an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice\u201d or \u201cbecause he made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigati on, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2000e -3(a).  Title VII thus prohibits an employer from \u201cretaliating against an employee for \ncomplaining about, or reporting, discrimination or retaliation.\u201d  Carvalho- Grevious v. Delaware \nState Univ., 851 F.3d 249, 256 (3d Cir. 2017).   \nA prima facie  case of retaliation under Title VII requires a plaintiff to prove that (1) she \nengaged in protected activity; (2)  the employer took a materially adverse action against her; and  \nthere was a causal conne ction  between the protected activity and the employer\u2019s action.\u201d   LeBoon \nv. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\u2019n, 503 F.3d 217, 231 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Moore v. City of Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 341- 42 (3d Cir. 2006)).   \nRetaliation claims are subjec t to the McDonnell -Douglas  burden- shifting framework.  \nSullivan v. Hanover Foods Corp., No. CV 18- 803 (MN), 2020 WL 211216, at *6 (D. Del. Jan. 14, \n2020); Rumanek v. Indep. Sch. Mgmt., Inc., 50 F. Supp. 3d 571, 578 n.4 (D. Del Jan. 10, 2014).  \nUnder that f ramework,  Plaintiff must first make out a prima facie  case of retaliatory \ndiscrimination.  Daniels v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 776 F.3d 181, 193- 94 (3d Cir. 2015).  If she \nis successful,  the burden of production shifts to Defendant to articulate a \u201clegi timate, n on-\nretaliatory reason for having taken the adverse action.\u201d  Id.   If Defendant successfully completes 11 this second step, Plaintiff then has the opportunity to present evidence indic ating that Defendant\u2019s \nreason(s) are mere pretext for a retaliatory  motive.  Id.  Although the burden of production shifts \nback and forth, Plaintiff \u201chas the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times.\u201d  Id.  (citing Reeves , \n530 U.S. at 143).    \nPlaintiff a rgues that the bylaw amendment operated as a form of retaliation aga inst her  for \nfiling a complaint against Rementer .  (See D.I. 25 \u00b6 111).  Here, assuming that Plaintiff is able to \nmake out a prima facie  case of retaliation, there is no real dispute that  Defendant has offered a \nlegitimate, non -retaliatory  reason to adopt  the byl aw amendment.  The bylaw amendment was one \nof thirteen introduced as a group four months after her complaint.  The purpose of the bylaw \namendment was to avoid wage and hour liabilit y involved in having workers logging time as both \nvolunteers and pa id employees.  And the bylaw amendment impacted all members of Delmar FD , \ncurrent and new, and required at least two other members to elect between paid employment and \nvolunteer work.  Thus , the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the offered reas ons are a  \npretext.  With respect to this, Plaintiff asserts  numerous times in her answering brief that \nDefendant\u2019s actions were a pretext to terminate her .  (See D.I. 62 at 1, 3, 15 & 16).  The assertions, \nhowever, are conclusory at best \u2013 e.g., the \u201camend ment requiring member/employees to choose \none or the other was a pretext to terminate her .\u201d  There is no evidence cited and the Plaintiff has \nfailed to carry  her burden of production to go forward on her retaliation claim. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing r easons, D efendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is DENIED- IN-\nPART and GRANTED- IN-PART .  An appropriate order will follow.  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nAPRIL D.
