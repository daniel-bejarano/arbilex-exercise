INTRODUCTION \nPending before the Court is Petitioner Solomon Collins' (\"Petitioner\") original pro se \nPetition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and his Amended\u00a7 2254 \nPetition (hereinafter referred to as \"Petition\" ). (D.I. 2; D.I. 18) The State filed an Answer in \nopposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 27; D.I. 37) For the reasons discussed, the \nCourt will dismiss the Petition. \n11. BACKGROU ND \nAs summarized by the Delaware Supreme Court on Petitioner's post-conviction appeal, the \nfacts leading up to his arrest and conviction , as well as the result of Petitioner's criminal proceedings, \nare set forth below: \nOn October 8, 2009, Tommear Tinnin was shot to death while sitting \nin the back seat of a parked car with his two cousins and another young \nrelative. The assailant fled the scene and passed two bystanders, Violet \nGibson and Shakira Romeo. Gibson and Romeo met with Detective \nConner after the incident. They both identified [Petitioner] as the \nshooter from a photo array. Detective Conner made an audio \nrecording of his interview with Gibson. He did not record his \ninterview with Romeo. Instead, he took notes on his notepad and \ndirectly on the photo array he presented to Romeo during the \ninterview. \nAt trial, the testimony of Gibson and Romeo was inconsistent with \ntheir prior statements to Detective Conner. The State used 11 Del. C. \n\u00a7 3507 to introduce their out-of-court statements through Detective \nConner during his testimon y. The State also played the audio \nrecording of Gibson identifying [Petitioner] as the shooter, and \nintroduced into evidence the photo array Detective Conner had \nwritten on reflecting Romeo's identification. During his testimon y, \nDetective Conner clarified that Gibson had identified [Petitioner] as \nthe shooter because the recording identified the suspects by number \nrather than name. Further, he testified that Romeo identified \n[Petitioner] as the shooter and that he wrote notes regarding her \nstatements onto the photo array during the interview. After an eight day trial, a jury found [Petitioner] guilty of Murder First \nDegree, three counts of Reckless Endangering First Degree, two \ncounts of Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, \nand Possession of a Deadly Weapon by a Person Prohibited. On July \n15, 2011, the Superior Court sentenced [Petitioner] to life \nimprisonment for the murder conviction, and additional time for the \nremaining counts. \n[The Delaware Supreme Court] affirmed [Petitioner's] conviction on \ndirect appeal in 2012. In 2013, [Petitioner] filed a motion for \npostconviction relief [\"Rule 61 motion\"] alleging ineffective assistance \nof counsel. The Superior Court denied the motion and held that \ncounsel was not ineffective for failing to object, because admission of \nthe \u00a7 3507 statements of both Romeo and Gibson had been proper. \n[Petitioner] appealed the Superior Court's rulings on the admission of \neach witness' \u00a7 3507 statement. During the appeal, the State learned \nthat there was a discrepancy between the photo array that Romeo had \nused to identify [Petitioner], which the State admitted at trial (\"State's \nExhibit 84\"), and the copy that the State had sent to [Petitioner's] \nattorney during discovery . The word \"shooter\" was written on State's \nExhibit 84, but [Petitioner's] copy did not have the word \"shooter\" on \nit. At the parties' joint request, [the Delaware Supreme Court] \nremanded the case to the Superior Court for a hearing to explore the \nnature of the discrepanc y between the photos and retained jurisdiction. \n[The Delaware Supreme Court] declined to address [Petitioner's] \nsecond argument at that time, which pertains to Gibson's \u00a7 3507 \nstatement, at the time we issued the remand order. \nOn remand, the Superior Court held a hearing to address the \ndiscrepancy. The State offered the testimony of Detective Conner, the \ntrial prosecutors, and the trial defense attorney. The Superior Court \nfound that (1) Detective Conner added the word \"shooter\" to the \noriginal photo array shown to Romeo after the discovery copy was \nmade for [Petitioner]; (2) the alteration made to the original photo was \nnot done in bad faith or in response to the \u00a7 3507 issue that arose at \ntrial; (3) Romeo identified [Petitioner] as the shooter during her \ninterview with Detective Conner; and ( 4) exclusive of the photo array, \nthe trial prosecutors and defense counsel were aware during the \npendency of the case that Romeo had identified [Petitioner] as the \nshooter and expected her to testify consistent with that identification \nat trial. \nBased on these findings, the Superior Court held that [Petitioner's] \nineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. The court found that the \nissue of when Detective Conner wrote the word \"shooter\" on the \n2 photo array was immaterial because Romeo's statement still would \nhave been introduced as a \u00a7 3507 statement at trial. Therefore, even if \ntrial counsel had noticed the discrepanc y and raised the issue, the \noutcome would have been the same. Further, the Superior Court held \nthat [Petitioner] could not show he was prejudiced by the discrepancy \nbecause Romeo's identification of [Petitioner] as the shooter was never \nwithheld from trial counsel. Therefore, trial counsel was aware of \nRomeo's pretrial identification of [Petitioner] as the shooter and could \nhave expected testimony consistent with that identification at trial. \nCollins v. State, 138 A.3d 475 (Table), 2016 WL 2585782, at *2-3 (Del. May 2, 2016). On appeal after \nremand, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner 's Rule 61 \nmotion. Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *4-5. \nPetitioner initially filed a prose habeas Petition, as well as a motion to appoint counsel. (D.I. \n1; D.I. 4) The Federal Public Defender's Office (\"FPD\") filed a motion to join in Petitioner's \nmotion to appoint counsel (D.I. 6), which the Court granted (D.I. 10). Petitioner, now represented \nby the FPD, filed an Amended Petition. (D.I. 18) The State filed an Answer, to which Petitioner \nfiled a Reply. (D.I. 27; D.I. 37) \nIII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES \nA. Exhaustion and Procedural Default \nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the \npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); \nO'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270,275 (1971). The \nAEDPA states, in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in \ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted \nunless it appears that -\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of \nthe State; or \n3 (B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or \n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to \nprotect the rights of the applicant. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(6)(1). \nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to give \n\"state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete \nround of the State's established appellate review process.\" O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see also \nWerts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). A petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement \nby demonstrating that the habeas claims were \"fairly presented\" to the state's highest court, either \non direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court to \nconsider the claims on their merits. Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005); see also Castille v. Peoples, \n489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). \nA petitioner's failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules \npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts. See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d \nCir. 2000); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297-98 (1989). Although treated as technically exhausted, \nsuch claims are nonetheless procedurall y defaulted . See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160; Coleman v. Thompson, \n501 U.S. 722, 750-51 (1991). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state's highest \ncourt, but that court \"clearly and expressly\" refuses to review the merits of the claim due to an \nindependent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted. \nSee Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989). \nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the \npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting \ntherefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the \nclaims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To \n4 demonstrate cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \"some objective factor \nexternal to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\" \nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner \"must \nshow not merely that the errors at ... trial created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked \nto his actual and substantial disadvanta ge, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional \ndimensions.\" Id. at 494. \nAlternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner demonstrates \nthat failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. \nCarpenter, 529 U.S. 446,451 (2000); Wengerv. Frank, 266 F.3d 218,224 (3d Cir. 2001). A petitioner \ndemonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \"constitutional violation has probably resulted in \nthe conviction of one who is actually innocent.\" Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. Actual innocence means \nfactual innocence, not legal insufficienc y. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614,623 (1998). In \norder to establish actual innocence, the petitioner must present new reliable evidence -not \npresented at trial -that demonstrate s \"it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have \nfound petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 537-38 (2006); see \nSweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522-24 (3d Cir. 2002). \nB. Standard of Review \nIf a state's highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the federal court \nmust review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A claim has \nbeen \"adjudicated on the merits\" for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision \nfinally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a procedural or some other \nground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), \nfederal habeas relief may only be granted if the last reasoned state court decision was \"contrary to, \n5 or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the \nSupreme Court of the United States,\" or the state court's decision was an unreasonable \ndetermination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); \nsee also Williams v. TC!Jlor, 529 U.S. 362,412 (2000); Bond v. Beard, 539 F.3d 256, 289-90 (3d Cir. 2008). \n\"Deciding whether a state court's decision 'involved' an unreasonable application of federal \nlaw or 'was based on' an unreasonable determination of fact requires the federal habeas court to \ntrain its attention on the particular reasons -both legal and factual -why state courts rejected a state \nprisoner's federal claims, and to give appropriate deference to that decision .... \" Wilson v. Sellers, \n138 S. Ct. 1188, 1191-92 (2018). \nThis is a straightforward inquiry when the last state court to decide a \nprisoner's federal claim explains its decision on the merits in a reasoned \nopinion. In that case, a federal habeas court simply reviews the specific \nreasons given by the state court and defers to those reasons if they are \nreasonable. \nId. at 1192. However, when the relevant state court decision is not accompanied with reasons, \"the \nfederal court should 'look through' the unexplained decision to the last related state-court decision \nthat does provide a relevant rationale. It should then presume that the unexplained decision \nadopted the same.\" Id.; see also Ham\u00b7ngton v. \"Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011) (explaining that deferential \nstandard of\u00a7 2254( d) applies even \"when a state court's order is unaccompanied by an opinion \nexplaining the reasons relief has been denied\"). \"In such circumstances, the presumption that the \nfederal claim was adjudicated on the merits may be rebutted -either by the habeas petitioner (for \nthe purpose of showing that the claim should be considered by the federal court de novo) or by the \nState (for the purpose of showing that the federal claim should be regarded as procedurall y \ndefaulted ).\" Johnson v. Williams, 568 U.S. 289, 301-02 (2013). The rebuttable presumption that a \n6 state court has adjudicated a claim on the merits also applies \"when a state-court opinion addresses \nsome but not all of a defendant's claims.\" Id. at 298. \nWith respect to\u00a7 2254(d)(1 ), the Supreme Court has explained the distinction between \ndecisions that are \"contrary to\" clearly established federal law, and those that involve an \n\"unreasonable application\" of that law, as follows: \nUnder the \"contrary to\" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the \nwrit if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached \nby [the U.S. Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court \ndecides a case differently than [the U.S. Supreme] Court has on a set \nof materially indistinguishable facts. Under the \"unreasonable \napplication\" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the \nstate court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the \nU.S. Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that \nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner's case. \nWilliams v. Tqylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000). An \"incorrect\" application of federal law is not \nnecessarily an \"unreasonable\" one: \nId. at 410-11. [f]he most important point is that an unreasonable application of \nfederal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law .. \n. . Under\u00a7 2254(d)(1)'s \"unreasonable application\" clause, then, a \nfederal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court \nconcludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court \ndecision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or \nincorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable. \nAs for the amount of deference due a state court's factual findings, \u00a7 2254(d)(2) provides \nthat federal habeas relief may be granted if the state court's adjudication \"resulted in a decision that \nwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in \nthe court proceeding.\" Section 2254(e)(1) provides that \"a determination of a factual issue made by \na State court shall be presumed to be correct\" and the habeas petitioner \"shall have the burden of \nrebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence;\" this presumption of \n7 correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact. See also Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d \n280,286 (3d Cir. 2000). In the absence of explicit guidance from the Supreme Court on how to \napproach the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and 2254(e)(1),1 the Third Circuit has provided the \nfollowing: \n[f]he language of\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and\u00a7 2254(e)(1) implies an important \ndistinction: \u00a7 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness determination turns on a \nconsideration of the totality of the \"evidence presented in the state\u00ad\ncourt proceeding,\" while\u00a7 2254(e)(1) contemplates a challenge to the \nstate court's individual factual determinations, including a challenge \nbased wholly or in part on evidence outside the state trial record. \nWe therefore read\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and\u00a7 2254(e)(1) together as addressing \ntwo somewhat different inquiries. The fundamental prerequisite to \ngranting the writ on factual grounds is consideration of the evidence \nrelied upon in the state court proceeding. Section 2254( d) (2) mandates \nthe federal habeas court to assess whether the state court's \ndetermination was reasonable or unreasonable given that evidence. If \nthe state court's decision based on such a determination is \nunreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court \nproceeding, habeas relief is warranted . \nWithin this overarching standard, of course, a petitioner may attack \nspecific factual determination s that were made by the state court, and \nthat are subsidiary to the ultimate decision. Here, section 2254(e)(1) \ncomes into play, instructing that the state court's determination must \nbe afforded a presumption of correctness that the petitioner can rebut \nonly by clear and convincing evidence. In this inquiry, a petitioner may \ndevelop clear and convincing evidence by way of a hearing in federal \ncourt as long as he satisfies the necessary prerequisites. In the final \nanalysis however, even if a state court's individual factual \ndeterminations are overturned, what factual findings remain to support \nthe state court decision must still be weighed under the overarching \nstandard of section 2254(d)(2). \n1S ee Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S. 290, 300-01 (2010) (explicitly finding court did not need to determine \nrelationship between \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and 2254(e) in Wood's case and, therefore, knowingl y leaving \n'bpen the question whether \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies in every case presenting a challenge under \n\u00a7 2254( d) (2)\"). \n8 Lambert v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 235-36 (3d Cir. 2004). Particularly instructive is the Third \nCircuit's following reasoning: \nId. at 236 n.19. We adopt no rigid approach to habeas review of state fact-finding. In \nsome circumstances, a federal court may wish to consider subsidiary \nchallenges to individual fact-finding in the first instance applying the \npresumption of correctness as instructed by (e)(1). Then, after \ndeciding these challenges, the court will view the record under (d)(2) \nin light of its subsidiary decisions on the individual challenges . In other \ninstances, a federal court could conclude that even if petitioner \nprevailed on all of his individual factual challenges notwithstanding the \n(e)(1) presumption of their correctness, the remaining record might \nstill uphold the state court's decision under the overarching standard \nof (d)(2). In that event, presumabl y the (d)(2) inquiry would come first. \nWhatever the order of inquiry, however, two points are paramount. \nFirst, both (d)(2) and (e)(1) express the same fundamental principle of \ndeference to state court findings. Second, before the writ can be \ngranted, petitioner must show an unreasonable determination -under \n(d)(2) -in light of the entire record in the original state court trial. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nPetitioner timely filed the \u00a7 2254 Petition presently pending before the Court, asserting the \nfollowing claims: (1)(A) the Delaware Supreme Court erred when, in its Rule 61 appellate decision \nafter remand, it held that the \"newly discovered evidence\" of the altered photo array and Detective \nConner's related false testimony regarding the alteration was not prejudicial and did not amount to a \ndenial of Petitioner's due process right to a fair trial; and (B) the trial court erred by failing to exclude \nDetective Conner's testimony regarding Ms. Romeo's statements as an inadmissi ble interpretive \nnarrative under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 3507;2 (2) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during \n2The Amended Petition and Reply refer to both sub-arguments in Claim One as \"Trial Court \nError.\" However, the first sub-argument of Claim One (\"Claim One (A)\") clearly challenges the \nDelaware state court decisions during and after the Rule 61 remand, while the second sub-argument \nof Claim One (\"Claim One (B)\") appears to challenge the trial court's original decision that \n9 Petitioner 's trial by: (a) admitting into evidence the altered photo array (State Exhibit 84) and \nDetective Collins' related false testimony; (b) arguing facts during the opening statement that were \nnot produced during the trial; and (c) providing improper vouching during the closing argument; (3) \nineffective assistance of trial counsel; (4) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; (5) the trial court \nerred by giving an erroneous Allen jury instruction ;3 and (6) the cumulative effect of all of these \nerrors requires relief. The State filed an Answer. (D.l. 27) Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.l. 37) \nFormal pleadings drafted by lawyers are held to more stringent standards than allegations in \npleadings drafted by prose litigants. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976); see also Haines v. \nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (\"[A]llegations of the prose complaint [are held] to less stringent \nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\"). Petitioner is represented by counsel in this \nproceeding. Unfortunately, the Petition does not identify the precedent or specific constitutional \nparameters purportedly applicable to several Claims. Instead, the Petition asserts that Petitioner's \n\"convictions and sentences are invalid under federal constitutional guarantees of due process, equal \nprotection, effective assistance of counsel, confrontation, a fair trial, a fair and impartial jury of his \npeers, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment , and a reliable sentence due to trial court error.\" \n(D.l. 18 at 12) Those general constitutional references do not always seem to align with the \nPetition's convoluted presentation of the Claims. While Petitioner's Reply provides some specific \ncitations to Supreme Court precedent , the framing of the Claims is still somewhat vague and \nDetective Conner's testimony regarding Ms. Romeo's statemen t did not constitute an inadmissible \ninterpretive narrative under\u00a7 3507. \n3Claim Five in the Amended Petition consisted of two sub-arguments: (A) the trial court erred by \ngiving an erroneous Allen jury instruction; and (B) the trial court erred by failing to provide a special \neyewitness identification instruction. (D.l. 18 at 45-47) However, the Court will not address Claim \nFive (B) because Petitioner explicitly abandons Claim Five (B) in his Reply. (D.l. 37 at 58) \n10 convoluted. For instance, the Reply asserts \"[u]nder all legal standards, Detective Conner's false \ntestimony and falsified evidence warrant reversal of [Petitioner 's] conviction (Claims One, Two(A), \nThree(A), Three(G), Five(A)).\" (D.I. 37 at 2) (emphasis added) Petitioner's reference to \"all legal \nstandards\" fails to provide sufficient clarity. Although the Court has done its best to discern the \nfederal constitutional framework for Petitioner 's arguments, the Court cannot act as his attorney and \nmake the arguments for him. \nA. Claim One (B): The Trial Court Improperly Admitted Detective Conner's \nNarrative Interpret ation Of Romeo's Statements Under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 3507 \nAs presented in the Amended Petition, Claim One (B) asserts that the trial court erred by \nrejecting defense counsel's argument that Detective Conner's testimony concerning Romeo's \nidentification constituted an inadmissible narrative interpretation under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 3507. (D .I. 18 \nat 28-29) Petitioner 's Reply seemingly provides additional support for this argument by alleging that \nthe Delaware state courts \"(1) disregarded the trial court's stated reasons for admitting Romeo's \n\u00a7 3507 statement via Detective Conner's testimon y; [and] (2) created a new, retroactive basis for \nadmissibility that relied on the post-conviction testimony of Detective Conner.\" (D.I. 37 at 6-7) \nAlthough Petitioner asserts that the admission of the narrative interpretation violated his \n\"constitutional rjghts and [was] prejudicial, \" Claim One (B) clearly challenges the Delaware state \ncourts' resolution of a state law issue. (D.I. 18 at 29) \nIt is well-settled that federal habeas relief is not available to correct state law errors. See \nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 68 (1991); Pu/fry v. Hanis, 465 U.S. 37, 41 (1984) (\"A federal court may \nnot issue a writ on the basis of a perceived error of state law.\"); Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422, \n438 n.6 (1983) (\"[f]he Due Process Clause does not pennit the federal courts to engage in a finely-\n11 tuned review of the wisdom of state evidentiary rules.\"). Therefore, the Court will deny Claim One \n(B) because it fails to present an issue cognizable on federal habeas review. \nB. Claims One (A) and Two (A): The Admission Of The Altered Photo Array (\"State \nExhibit 84\") And Detective Conner's False Testimony Concerning State Exhibit \n84 Warrants Reversal Of Petitioner's Conviction \nClaims One (A) and Two (A) present due process claims based upon Detective Conner's \npurportedly false testimony and alteration of State Exhibit 84. Claim One (A) asserts that the \nDelaware state courts committed error during and after the Rule 61 remand by failing to find that \nthe admission of Detective Conner's false testimony and State Exhibit 84 violated Petitioner's due \nprocess rights. The prosecutorial misconduct argument in Claim Two (A) asserts that the State \nviolated Petitioner's due process rights because it knew or should have known that Detective \nConner falsely testified about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84. Since the \nunderlying allegations Petitioner asserts in Claims One and Two (A) are related, the Court addresses \nthem together. \n1. Claim One (A): After the Rule 61 remand, the Delaware Supreme Court \nerred by not concluding that the admission of State Exhibit 84 and \nDetective Conner's false testimony violated Petitioner's due process right \nto a fair trial \nIn Claim One (A), Petitioner contends that the Delaware state courts committed factual and \nlegal errors during and after the Rule 61 remand by not finding that the admission of the altered \nphoto array and Detective Conner's testimony regarding Romeo's statement violated his due process \nright to a fair trial warranting a reversal of his conviction. 4 (D .I. 18 at 12) The premise of Claim \n4Claim One is not a model of clarity. Petitioner presents Claim One in his Amended Petition as a \nbroad factual description of errors he alleges occurred in his Rule 61 proceedings on remand, and \npremises his legal argument on numerous general constitutional principles. For instance, Petitioner \ncontends that his \"convictions and sentences are invalid under federal constitutional guarantees of \ndue process, equal protection, effective assistance of counsel, confrontation, a fair trial, a fair and \n12 One is that the Delaware state courts committed two errors during and after the Rule 61 remand by \nnot concluding that \"Detective Conner's false testimony and falsified evidence warrant reversal of \n[Petitioner's] conviction\" and by not granting him a new trial. (D.I. 37 at 2, 15) The Court has \nalready determined that one of the errors -the improper admission of Detective Conner's testimony \nunder \u00a7 3507 (Claim One (B)) -asserts a state law issue that is not cognizable on federal habeas \nreview. See supra at Section IV.A. Petitioner asserts that the Delaware state courts committed the \nother error on remand (\"Claim One (A)\") by \"finding that an altered exhibit [State Exhibit 84] and \nperjured testimony was not prejudicial;\" he specifically contends: \nThe Superior Court erred when it ruled that [Petitioner] was not \nprejudiced by Detective Conner's false testimony that he wrote the \nword 'shooter' on the photo array contemporaneous with his interview \nwith the alleged identification witness. Had the jury learned of his \nfalsification, it would have discredited his remaining testimony given \nthat the jury was deadlocked after three days of deliberation and \nconvicted [Petitioner] only after being given the Allen charge. \n(D.I. 18 at 12) Petitioner alleges that he was prejudiced by the introduction of the altered evidence \n(State Exhibit 84) and Detective Conner's perjured testimony because: (1) \"[t]here was no in-court \nidentification of [Petitioner] as a culprit other than that by Detective Conner or direct evidence\" \n(D.I. 18 at 25); (2) \"Detective Conner's shooter testimony caused the denial of the Motion for \nJudgment of Acquittal\" (D.I. 18 at 27); and (3) it \"was a close case for the jury\" as reflected in the \nfact that the \"jury deliberated for eleven hours over three days, deadlocked, and only convicted \nimpartial jury of his peers, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and a reliable sentence due \nto trial court error.\" (D.I. 18 at 12) Petitioner 's Reply identifies the applicable Supreme Court \nprecedent for the related prosecutorial misconduct argument in Claim Two but does not provide any \napplicable precedent for Claim One. Nevertheless, given the substantial overlap between Claim One \nand Claim Two(a), the Court understands Petitioner's primary focus in Claim One to be that the \nDelaware Supreme Court on remand violated his constitutional right to due process by not reversing \nhis conviction. \n13 [Petitioner] after the coercive Allen charge was given\" (D .I. 18 at 28). Relying on this argument, \nPetitioner then contends that the Delaware Supreme Court erred in affirming the Superior Court's \ndenial of his Rule 61 motion, arguing that the Delaware \"state courts violated his federal rights to \ndue process by finding that Conner's altered exhibit [State Exhibit 84] and perjured testimony was \nnot prejudicial.\" (D.I. 37 at 20) \nPetitioner exhausted state remedies for Claim One (A)5 by explicitly presenting Claim One's \ngeneral argument of factual and legal error to the Delaware Supreme Court on post-conviction \nappeal upon return from remand.6 (D.I. 18-12 at 5-15) However, the Court must determine the \napplicable standard of review.7 Having carefully scrutinize d the Delaware Supreme Court's post-\n5Petitioner exhausted state remedies for both Claim One (A) and (B), and the Court's conclusion \nregarding the standard of review for Claim One (A) applies equally for Claim One (B). However, as \npreviousl y discussed, Claim One (B) is not cognizable. Therefore, the instant discussion focuses on \nClaim One (A). \n6For instance, the first argument in Petitioner's Opening Supplemental Memorandum on post\u00ad\nconviction appeal asserted that the \"Superior Court committed legal error, made improper factual \nfindings and abused its discretion in finding that the alteration of the photo array [State Exhibit 84], \nand [Detective Conner's] false testimon y, did not constitute constitutional error supporting reversal \nof [Petitioner's] convictions .\" (D.I. 18-12 at 5) The second argument in the Opening Supplemental \nMemorandum on post-conviction appeal asserted that Petitioner's \"state and federal constitutional \ndue process rights to a fair trial and right of confrontation were violated by the erroneous admission \nof the highly prejudicial out-of-court statement of Shakira Romeo as it was based upon altered \nevidence [State Exhibit 84] and [Detective Conner's] false testimony.\" (D.I. 18-12 at 13) \n7Petitioner 's position on the applicable standard of review for Claim One (A) is less than clear. In \nthe Amended Petition, Petitioner asserts that the Delaware Supreme Court's decision affirming the \ndenial of his Rule 61 motion after determining that Petitioner suffered no prejudice from the \nadmission of the altered photo array and Detective Conner's testimony \"was contrary to and an \nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law, and involved an unreasonable application \nof the facts.\" (D.I. 18 at 28-29) Petitioner 's reference to the \"contrary to\" and \"unreasonable \napplication\" language demonstrates Petitioner's reliance on\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2) as the applicable \nstandard. However, in his Reply, Petitioner contends that the \"Court should review both the trial \ncourt error and the prosecutorial misconduct claim de novo.\" (D.I. 37 at 26) In contrast, the State \nasserts that the Court must review the Claim under the deferential standard in\u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2) \nbecause the Delaware Supreme Court adjudicated the merits of the Claim as the predicate issue \nunderlying Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. (D.I. 27 at 8) \n14 conviction appellate decision in conjunction with the Parties' assertions and the record, the Court \nmakes the following conclusions. First, since the \"after discovered evidence\" of the altered photo \narray was presented to the Superior Court on Rule 61 remand, the Court must review the factual \ndecisions the Delaware state courts made during and after remand rather than the trial court's factual \ndeterminations . To the extent it is relevant, the Court concurs with the State's contention that the \nDelaware Supreme Court properly reviewed the Superior Court's factual findings on remand under \nthe \"clearly erroneous standard\" set forth in Anderson v. Ciry of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985).8 \nAfter applying the \"clear error\" standard, the Delaware Supreme Court accepted as correct the \n8The State essentiall y characterizes Claim One as challenging the factual basis for the Delaware \nSupreme Court's post-conviction appellate decision by describing the premise of Claim One to be \nthat the state courts violated Petitioner 's due process and confrontation rights by making clearly \nerroneous factual findings. (D.I. 27 at 11) With this focus, the State proceeds to argue that the \nDelaware Supreme Court applied the appropriate Supreme Court precedent governing claims of \nfactual error articulated in Anderson v. Ciry ojBessemer, 470 U.S. 564,574 (1985), when it reviewed the \nSuperior Court's factual findings under the deferential \"clearly erroneous\" standard of review. (D.I. \n27 at 9) The State contends that the Delaware Supreme Court's decision \"to give deference to the \nSuperior Court because those findings were not clearly erroneous was neither contrary to nor an \nunreasonable application of Bessemer' (D.I. 27 at 10), and concludes its position on the appropriate \nstandard of review for Claim One by stating: \n[Petitioner], whether in state court or here, has failed to rebut the \nSuperior Court's findings by clear and convincing evidence. The state \ncourt's findings were supported by the record made at a postconviction \nhearing. [Petitioner's] claim that the state courts violated his \nconstitutional rights by making clearly erroneous factual findings is \nclearly without merit and the state courts' findings should be presumed \ncorrect for purposes of [Petitioner 's] claims of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel. \n(D.I. 27 at 11-12) The Court views the more relevant question in this proceeding to be whether the \nDelaware state courts' factual findings satisfy the requirements of\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and\u00a7 2254(e)(1), not \nwhether the Delaware Supreme Court applied the correct standard of review. Importantly, as \nexplained more thoroughly in the text of the Opinion, the Court concludes that the Delaware state \ncourts' factual determinations satisfy\u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1). \n15 following factual findings made by the Superior Court: (1) Romeo identified Petitioner as the \nshooter during her interview; (2) Detective Conner added the word \"shooter\" to the photo array \nsometime after the discovery copy of the photo array was provided to the defense but prior to trial; \n(3) Detective Conner did not add the word \"shooter\" in bad faith or in response to the \u00a7 3507 issue \nthat arose during the trial; ( 4) trial counsel was aware that Romeo had identified Petitioner as the \nshooter before trial and expected her to testify to that fact; and (5) Detective Conner's police report \nand affidavit of probable cause, authored well in advance of trial, reflected Romeo's pretrial \nidentification of Petitioner as the shooter. See Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *5. Since Petitioner \ndoes not challenge these particular subsidiary factual findings, the Court presumes they are correct \nunder\u00a7 2254(e)(1). In turn, after considering these subsidiary factual findings in the context of the \ntotality of the evidence the Superior Court had before it during its evidentiary hearing on remand, \nthe Court concludes that both the Superior Court and the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably \ndetermined the facts in light of the evidence presented to the Superior Court under\u00a7 2254(d)(2). \nThe Superior Court was in the best position to weigh the evidence and make credibility \ndeterminations, and the Delaware Supreme Court was entitled to give deference to the Superior \nCourt's factual findings. Thus, the Court accepts as correct the five specific factual findings \nmentioned above (that were also identified the by Delaware Supreme Court). \nHowever, contrary to the State's implicit assertion, the Court's deference to the Delaware \nstate courts' factual findings on remand does not end the Court's duty to determine whether the \nadmission of the altered photo array and Detective Conner's testimony deprived Petitioner of his \ndue process right to a fair trial.9 Instead, the factual findings the Court has accepted as correct \n9 After focusing on the factual aspect of Claim One (A), the State argues that Petitioner's \"claim that \nthe state courts violated his constitutional rights by making clearly erroneous factual findings is \n16 provide the starting point for the Court's inquiry into Petitioner's alleged constitutional violations -\nnot the ending point. Additionally, although Petitioner does not challenge the aforementioned five \nspecific factual findings, he does challenge the Delaware state courts' failure to make certain factual \nfindings,10 asserting that the state courts: (1) ignored Detective Conner's perjury; and (2) ignored the \nimpact that the discovery of the photo array alteration and Detective Conner's perjury would have \nhad on Detective Conner's credibility . (D.I. 37 at 6-7) A review of the record demonstrates that \nneither the Superior Court nor the Delaware Supreme Court on remand considered: (1) whether the \n\"after discovered evidence\" concerning the timing of the alteration to State Exhibit 84 demonstrated \nthat Detective Conner's testimony on voir dire that he wrote the word \"shooter\" on the photo array \ncontemporaneously with Romeo's interview was false or constituted perjury;11 or (2) whether \ndisclosing that information during the trial would have affected Detective Conner's credibility .12 \nclearly without merit and the state court's findings should be presumed correct for purposes of \n[Petitioner's] claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\" (D.I. 27 11-12) The State's brief reference \nto Petitioner's \"constitutional rights\" essentiall y ignores the due process argument at issue in Claim \nOne (A). \n1\u00b0Fetitioner also asserts that the Delaware state courts \"(1) disregarded the trial court's stated reasons \nfor admitting Romeo's \u00a7 3507 statement via Detective Conner's testimony; (2) created a new, \nretroactive basis for admissibility that relied on the post-conviction testimony of Detective Conner; \nand [(3)] ignored that it was a very close case for the jury, which was deadlocked after three days of \ndeliberation.\" (D.I. 37 at 6-7) The first two assertions relate to Claim One (B) which, as previousl y \nexplained, asserts a state law issue that is not cognizable on federal habeas review. See supra at \nSection IV.A.1. The Court views Petitioner's third assertion about it being a very close case for the \njury as a factor to be discussed when considering the materiality prong of the prosecutorial \nmisconduct alleged in Claim Two(A). See infra at Section IV.A.3. \n11During the voir dire concerning Detective Conner's interview of Romeo, Detective Conner stated \nthat he wrote the words Romeo stated \"by the various pictures\" on State Exhibit 84 \"while [he] was \ninterviewing [Romeo] on the park bench.\" (D.I. 30-3 at 133) \n12Given the manner in which the Delaware Supreme Court framed the issue for remand, the \nSuperior Court limited its inquiry during the evidentiary hearing to the circumstances surrounding \nthe alteration of the photo array without considering Detective Conner's related testimony. \n17 Since there are no state court factual findings with respect to the falsity or veracity of Detective \nConner's testimony on voir dire regarding when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 8413 or \nthe effect that information would have had on the jury's view of Detective Conner's credibility, the \nCourt is not constrained by\u00a7 2254(d)(2)'s deferential standard when considering these two particular \nfactual issues. The Court will, therefore, review these factual contentions de novo. \nHaving accepted as correct the Delaware state courts' factual determination that Detective \nConner wrote the word \"shooter\" on the photo array sometime after the discovery copy of the array \nwas provided to the defense but before the trial commenced, the Court must conclude that \nDetective Conner testified falsely during voir dire when he stated that he wrote the word \"shooter\" \non the array when he interviewed Romeo. (D.I. 30-3 at 133) Hence, the Court must move to the \nnext step of the analysis. \nWhether or not the Delaware state courts' failure to consider the truthfulness of Detective Conner's \nrelated testimony was unreasonable is not at issue here. \n13Whether or not a person committed perjury is a factual issue which, if addressed by the state court, \nis subject to the deferential standard set forth in\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and\u00a7 2254(e)(1). See, e.g., Lambert, \n387 F.3d at *242-43. If a post-conviction court reaches a credibility determination, that \ndetermination is also subject to the deferential standard set forth in\u00a7 2254(d)(2) and\u00a7 2254(e)(1). \nSee Campbell, 209 F.3d at 290. The Third Circuit has opined that, \n[w]e have not had occasion, to this point, to specifically address the deference we \nafford to credibility findings, as opposed to factual findings more generally, once we \ndetermine that AEDPA deference is inapplicable. There is no question, however, that \ncredibility findings in that context are also presumed correct absent \"clear and \nconvincing evidence\" to the contrary, Breakiron [v. Horn], 642 F.3d [126,] 131 [3d Cir. \n2011)], because \"[i]n cases where the AEDPA standards of review do not apply, federal \nhabeas courts apply pre-AEDPA standards of review,\" Jacobs, 395 F.3d at 100, and \npre-AEDPA, \"federal habeas courts [had] no license to redetermine credibility of \nwitnesses whose demeanor ha[d] been observed by the state trial court, but not by \nthem,\" Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422,434, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983). \nVickers v. Sup't Grateiford SCI, 858 F.3d 841, 850 (3d Cir. 2017), as amended (July 18, 2017). \n18 Although Petitioner presented the federal due process/fair trial violation in Claim One (A) \nto the Delaware Supreme Court on post-conviction appeal, after applying \"last reasoned state court \ndecision rule\" to the Delaware Supreme Court's Rule 61 appellate decision, the Court finds that the \nDelaware Supreme Court did not adjudicate the legal argument in Claim One (A) on the merits \nwhen it reviewed Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See general!J Collins, 2016 WL \n2585782, at *1-5. Rather, after explaining why it accepted the Superior Court's factual findings on \nremand concerning the alteration of State Exhibit 84, the Delaware Supreme Court focused on \nwhether \"the later discovery of the discrepancy between the two photograph\" line-ups affected the \nSuperior Court's initial Rule 61 conclusion that Petitioner failed to satisfy either prong of Strickland v. \nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), with his \u00a7 3507 argument that Detective Conner's testimony \namounted to an inadmissible interpretive narrative , see Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *4-5. In other \nwords, the Delaware Supreme Court analyzed the alteration of State Exhibit 84 solely in context of \nDelaware law and\u00a7 3507. When determining that Petitioner did not establish prejudice under \nStrickland, the Delaware Supreme Court did not address any possible due process implications \nresulting from the admission of falsified evidence and perjured testimony .14 See id. Given these \n14For instance, the Delaware Supreme Court held that Petitioner's ineffective assistance of appellate \ncounsel argument \"fails under the second prong of Strickland,\" because the Superior Court's correct \nconclusion regarding the admissibility of Detective Conner's testimony demonstrated that \"there \nwas no reasonable probability that appealing the issue would have been fruitful.\" Collins, 2016 WL \n2585782, at *5. As for Petitioner's ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument, the Delaware \nSupreme Court opined that \n[Petitioner] cannot demonstrate prejudice from trial counsel's failure \nto recognize the discrepanc y. State's Exhibit 84 was not the only time \nwhere Detective Conner recorded that Romeo had identified \n[Petitioner] as the shooter. Detective Conner's police report and \naffidavit of probable cause reflect Romeo's pretrial identification of \n[Petitioner] as the shooter. Furthermore, trial counsel was aware that \nRomeo had identified Petitioner as the shooter before trial and \n19 circumstances, AEDPA's deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is not applicable and the Court will \nreview the Delaware Supreme Court's conclusion regarding the legal arguments in Claim One (A) de \nnovo. \nTo reiterate, Claim One (A) alleges that the Delaware state courts erred on remand by failing \nto find that Detective Conner's alteration of State Exhibit 84 and false testimony prejudiced \nPetitioner and violated his federal constitutional right to due process. (D.I. 37 at 4) Even on de novo \nreview, a federal habeas court determines the constitutional claim based on clearly established \nfederal law. See Teague, 489 U.S. 288; Kater v. Malonry, 459 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Kater's \nassumption that a federal court engaged in de novo review does not ask whether a particular claim is \nbased on already clearly established federal law -would lead to an end-run around the Teague \ndoctrine\"). It is well-settled that a conviction obtained by the government's knowing use of \nperjured testimony violates due process, and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood \nthat the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury. See United States v. Agurs, 427 \nU.S. 97 (1976); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269-71 (1959); Moonry v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 \n(1935). Notably, however, the Supreme Court has never held that a due process violation occurs \nwhen a defendant is convicted on the basis of perjured testimony when the government was \nunaware of such perjury at the time of the trial. In turn, the Third Circuit also requires (among \nexpected her to testify to that fact at trial. The State also introduced \nevidence that gunshot residue and [Petitioner's] DNA were found on \nthe sweatshirt that both witnesses saw him wearing. Further, the State \npresented the recording of Gibson identifying [Petitioner] in the \nlineup. Therefore, it is not \"reasonabl y likely the outcome would have \nbeen different\" if trial counsel had identified the discrepancy. \nId. The Delaware Supreme Court did not mention the Supreme Court cases typically identified \nwhen dealing with allegations of perjured testimon y -such as Napue, Giglio, or Agurs -or Petitioner's \ngeneral due process right to a fair trial. \n20 other things) that a petitioner seeking to establish a due process violation must demonstrate that the \ngovernment knew or should have known about the false testimony. See Haskell v. Sup't Greene SCI, \n866 F.3d 139, 146 (3d Cir. 2017). Since Claim One (A) does not assert that the State knew or should \nhave known that Detective Conner falsely testified about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on \nState Exhibit 84, the Claim fails to assert a prima facie due process claim.15 See Howes v. Fields, 565 \nU.S. 499, SOS (2012) (\"clearly established law signifies the holdings ... of [the Supreme] Court's \ndecisions\"). \nTo the extent that Petitioner's contention regarding State Exhibit 84 should be construed as \nan assertion that the admission of State Exhibit 84 violated Bracfy v. Maryland, 3 73 U.S. 83 (1963), it is \nalso unavailing. A petitioner establishes a Bracfy v. Maryland violation by showing that: (1) the \nevidence at issue was favorable to the accused, either because it was exculpatory or it had \nimpeachment value: (2) the prosecution suppressed the evidence, either willfully or inadvertently; \nand (3) the evidence was material. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999); Lambert, 387 \nF.3d at 252. Here, since both the defense and the State had access to the unaltered discovery copy \nof the photo array and the altered copy of the photo array that was admitted at trial (State Exhibit \n84), Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the State knowingly or inadvertently suppressed the fact that \n15In his Reply, Petitioner attempts to gloss over the fact that Claim One (A) does not allege that the \nState knew or should have known that Detective Conner testified falsely by combining its argument \nfor Claim One (A) with that for Claim Two (A), which does assert that the State knew or should \nhave known about the falsity of Detective Conner's testimony. But the claims are different, are pled \ndifferently, and are subject to different legal analyses. In particular, the prosecutorial misconduct \nargument in Claim Two (A) is procedurally defaulted because Petitioner did not present that \nargument to the Delaware Supreme Court on post-conviction appeal. His claims cannot simply be \ncombined. Under the proper analysis, Claim One (A), which is exhausted and reviewable de novo in \nthis proceeding, fails to assert a necessary element for finding a due process violation, whereas the \nperjury argument in Claim Two (A), which does assert the knowledge element, is procedurally \ndefaulted and, therefore, reviewed under more limited terms. \n21 Detective Conner altered State Exhibit 84. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim One (A) in its \nentirety as meritless . \n2. Claim Two (A): The State Violated Petitioner's Due Process Rights \nBecause It Knew (Or Should Have Known) That Detective Conner Falsely \nTestified About When He Wrote The Word \"Shooter'' On State Exhibit 84 \nIn Claim Two (A), Petitioner alleges that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by \nadmitting State Exhibit 84 into evidence and failing to correct Detective Conner's perjured \ntestimony concerning Romeo's identification of Petitioner as the shooter. (D.I. 18 at 30) Citing \nMooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112-13 (1935), Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264,269 (1959), Giglio v. \nUnited States, 405 U.S. 15, 153-54 (1972), United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103 (1976), United States v. \nBagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), and other cases, Petitioner asserts: (1) \"it is undisputed that [Detective] \nConner provided false testimony and falsified evidence\" (D.I. 37 at 14); (2) Detective Conner knew \nState Exhibit 84 and his testimony concerning Romeo's statement were false and his knowledge is \nimputed to the State; (3) the State had a duty to prevent, or at least discover, that Detective Conner \ntampered with evidence and testified falsely; and (4) Detective Conner's false testimony and falsified \nevidence was material. (D.I. 37 at 11-20) Petitioner contends that he exhausted state remedies for \nClaim Two (A) by presenting a \"substantial equivalent\" of the Claim to the Delaware Supreme \nCourt on post-conviction appeal after remand. (D.I. 37 at 20) He then asserts that the Court \nshould review Claim Two (A) de novo because the Delaware Supreme Court \"failed to directly \naddress the underlying prosecutorial misconduct issue.\" (D.I. 37 25) \nIn contrast, the State contends that Petitioner did not present Claim Two (A) to the \nDelaware Supreme Court on post-conviction appeal after remand, explaining \ninstead, [he] presented the claim that his constitutional rights were \nviolated by the erroneous admission of Romeo's 11 Del. C. \u00a7 3507 \n22 (D.I. 27 at 15) statement because it was based on the altered exhibit and related \ntestimony. \nFor exhaustion purposes, the crucial inquiry is whether the substance of the Petitioner's \nclaim has been presented to the state courts in a manner sufficient to put the courts on notice of the \nfederal constitutional claim. See Picard, 404 U.S. at 278. A petitioner does not need to cite \"book \nand verse on the federal constitution\" in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement. Id. \nNevertheless, after carefully reviewing Petitioner's Opening Supplemental Memorandum and his \nReply Supplemental Memorandum that he presented to the Delaware Supreme Court on post\u00ad\nconviction appeal after remand, the Court concludes that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies \nfor the prosecutorial misconduct argument presented in Claim Two (A). When viewed in context, it \nis clear that the first two arguments in Petitioner's Supplemental Reply on post-conviction appeal \nafter remand present two sub-parts of the same argument regarding the Superior Court's legal and \nfactual errors that he presents in Claim One of this proceeding. Significantly, although Petitioner's \nfirst argument in the Supplemental Reply on post-conviction appeal after remand explicitly refers to \nthe legal and factual errors the Superior Court allegedly committed during the Rule 61 remand, and \nhis third argument specifically refers to trial counsel's ineffective assistance, there is no explicit \nreference to \"prosecutorial misconduct\" anywhere in his post-conviction appellate Supplemental \nReply. In addition, Petitioner's references to \"impeachment evidence,\" \"police officer malfeasance,\" \n\"Detective Conner's malfeasance,\" and \"fairness of the trial\" were not sufficient to put the Delaware \nSupreme Court on notice that he was also asserting a false testimony / due process violation \nargument based on prosecutorial misconduct or a falsified evidence/ Brac{y violation /prosecutorial \nmisconduct argument. In other words, Petitioner did not \"fairly present\" to the Delaware Supreme \n23 Court the instant argument that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct based on the \ncontentions that the State should have known that (1) Detective Conner falsely testified and should \nhave corrected that false testimon y, and (2) Detective Conner presented falsified evidence . Given \nthese circumstances, the Court concludes that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for Claim \nTwo (A). \nAt this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to present Claim Two (A) to the Delaware state \ncourts in a new Rule 61 motion would be denied as time-barred under Rule 61(i)(1), and also as \nsuccessive under Rule 61(i)(2)and Rule 61(d).16 Consequently, the Court must treat the instant \nargument as technically exhausted but procedurall y defaulted , meaning that the Court cannot review \nthe merits of the argument absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or that a miscarriage of justice \nwould occur if the Court did not review the claim. \nIn his Amended Petition, Petitioner makes a general assertion that any procedural default \nshould be excused \"because of the ineffective assistance of trial, appellate, and state post-conviction \ncounsel.\" (D.I 18 at 10) In his Reply, Petitioner asserts that he \"can demonstrate cause and \nprejudice to overcome the default [of Claim Two (A)] based on post-conviction counsel's ineffective \nfailure to raise the claim\u008f.\" (D.I. 37 at 45) Since the circumstances surrounding Detective Conner's \nalteration of State Exhibit 84 and the possibility that Detective Conner's related testimony may be \nfalse were not revealed until the Rule 61 remand, the Court concludes that the focus of the instant \nprocedural default analysis should be on post-conviction counsel 's failure to raise Claim Two (A) \n16After acknowledging the possibility that the Court would find Claim Two (A) unexhausted, \nPetitioner alternatively asserts that Claim Two (A) is technicall y exhausted but procedurally defaulted \nbecause a new Rule 61 motion would be barred as untimely and successive. (D.I. 37 at 44-45) \n24 during the Rule 61 remand and on post-conviction appeal after remand, rather than on trial or \nappellate counsels' actions during the original criminal proceeding and appeal. \nNavigating the convoluted procedural default issues presented by this unique factual and \nprocedural situation would be more complicated than reaching the merits of Claim Two (A).17 Thus, \n17Citing Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012), Petitioner asserts that post-conviction counsel's \nineffective assistance provides cause for his procedural default of Claim Two (A). (D.I. 37 at 44-49) \nIn Martinet the Supreme Court held that inadequate assistance of counsel during an initial-review \nstate collateral proceeding may establish cause for a petitioner's procedural default of a claim of \nineffective assistance of trial counsel. See id. at 16-17. \"The Martinez Court made clear, however, \nthat this is a narrow exception ... [that] applies only to attorney error in the initial-review collateral \nproceedings, not appeals from those proceedin gs.\" Norris v. Brooks, 794 F.3d 401, 404-05 (3d Cir. \n2015). As explained by the Third Circuit, the reason for Martinez.s very narrow applicability seems \nto be \"that the [Supreme] Court was concerned only about cases in which the error of a prisoner's \ncollateral review attorney results in 'no state court at any level' hearing the prisoner's claim and the \nclaim being defaulted for purposes of habeas review in a federal court.\" Id. at 404-05. Even after \nMartinet there is no constitutional right to counsel during a collateral proceeding. See, e.g., Coleman, \n501 U.S. at 752 (holding there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings ); Martinet 566 U.S. at \n16 (stating that \"rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here\"); \nNorris, 794 F.3d at 405) (\"Outside of these 'limited circumstances', Martinez made clear that Coleman \nremains the law.\"). \nIn the Court's view, Martinez does not provide an avenue for excusing the default of Claim \nTwo (A). First, Claim Two (A) asserts a prosecutorial misconduct argument, not an argument that \ntrial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege the prosecutorial misconduct \ndescribed in Claim Two (A). See Davila v. Davis, 137 S.Ct. 2058, 2065 (2017) (\"On its face, Martinez \nprovides no support for extending its narrow exception to new categories of procedurall y defaulted \nclaims.\"); but see, e.g., Preston v. Sup't Graterford SCI, 902 F.3d 365 (3d Cir. 2018) (applying Martinez to \nexcuse post-conviction counsel's default of Petitioner's defaulted ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim in order to provide cause to overcome default of Petitioner's stand-alone Confrontation \nClause claim). Second, the procedural default was caused by post-conviction counsel's failure to \npresent Claim Two (A) on post-conviction appeal, rather than his failure to present it during the \ninitial post-conviction proceeding. \nThe Court recognizes no state court at any level heard Claim Two (A) because Detective \nConner's alteration of State Exhibit 84 was not revealed until the Rule 61 remand, meaning that only \npost-conviction counsel could have asserted that Detective Conner's testimony on voir dire did not \ncorrespond with the Superior Court's factual finding on remand that Detective Conner altered State \nExhibit 84 after his interview with Romeo. It would appear, however, that the Court cannot excuse \nthe instant default on the basis that doing so would effectuate the underlying intent of Martinez to \navoid such a situation, because: (1) Claim Two (A) is not an ineffective assistance of trial counsel \n25 in the interest of judicial economy, the Court will exercise its discretion and proceed to the merits of \nClaim Two (A). See 28 U.S.C. 2254(b)(2) (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied \non the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the \ncourts of the State.\"); see also Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 277 (2005) (\"An application for a writ of \nhabeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust \nthe remedies available in the courts of the State.\"). \nIn order to prevail on the instant argument of prosecutorial misconduct, Petitioner must \ndemonstrate: (1) Detective Conner committed perjury; (2) the State knew or should have known of \nDetective Conner's perjury; (3) the testimony went uncorrected; and (4) there is a reasonable \nlikelihood that the false testimony could have affected the verdict. See Haskell, 146 F.3d at 146. \nLambert, 387 F.3d at 242. The Court will address the elements in seriatim. \na. Prosecutorial misconduct based on Detective Conner's \nperjury/ false testimony \ni. Perjury/ false testimony and the State's knowledge \nPerjury is committed when a witness \"gives false testimony concerning a material matter \nwith the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or \nfaulty memory.\" United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993); see also United States v. Rose, 215 \nF.2d 617, 622-23 (3d Cir. 1954) (\"Perjury is the willful, knowing and corrupt giving, under oath, of \nfalse testimony material to the issue or point of inquiry.\"). As previously explained, during the Rule \nclaim; and (2) the default occurred on post-conviction appeal and not during the initial post\u00ad\nconviction proceeding. Moreover, since there is no constitutional right to counsel during a state \ncollateral proceeding, the Court cannot consider the issue of post-conviction counsel's \nineffectiveness in Petitioner's Rule 61 proceeding, either during the initial Rule 61 proceeding or \nRule 61 appeal, as an independent claim. \n26 61 remand, the Superior Court did not consider the veracity of Detective Conner's testimony on voir \ndire about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84. Consequentl y, under the \napplicable de novo standard of review, Petitioner may establish that Detective Conner's testimony \nconstituted perjury if he can prove the same by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., Jefferson v. \nGDCP Warden, 941 F.3d 452, 473 (11th Cir. 2019) (explaining that when state court's fact-finding is \n\"stripped\" of\u00a7 2254( d) presumption of correctness, \"petitioner then must establish the facts \nnecessary to support his claim by only a preponderance of the evidence\"); Reyes v. Ercole, 2018 WL \n1517204 at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2018). \nThe following background information provides relevant context for the instant issue. \nDetective Conner did not record his interview with Romeo but, instead, took notes on his notepad \nand on the photo array he showed to Romeo. (D.I. 18-11 at 5) During Petitioner's trial, Romeo \ntestified that she was present when the shooting occurred and heard gunshots, but she could not \npositively identify Petitioner as the shooter. (D.I 18-11 at 4-5) She also testified she spoke with \nDetective Conner about the shooting but did not remember what she said. (D.I 18-11 at 5) When \nRomeo stated she did not remember what she had told Detective Conner during the interview, the \nState asked if it could \"call a witness [that is, Detective Conner] pursuant to 11 Delaware Code, \nSection 3507.\" (D.I. 31-3 at 129) The defense requested \"an opportunity to voirdire the detective \noutside the presence of the jury to make sure that what he's telling us are the exact words of the \nwitness as he is required by case law, and he doesn't add his own recollection ... of what was said.\" \n(D .I. 31-3 at 131) The voir dire of Detective Conner took place outside the presence of the jury (id. at \n131-32); the following excerpt from that voir dire focuses on when Detective Conner wrote the words \non the photo array he showed Romeo during the interview that was identified as State Exhibit 84: \nSTATE: Do you recognize what State Exhibit 84 is? \n27 CONNER: \nSTATE: \nCONNER: \nSTATE: \nCONNER: \nSTATE: \nCONNER: \nSTATE: \nCONNER: \nSTATE: \nCONNER: \nSTATE: \nCONNER: \n(Id. at 133) Yes. \nAnd what is it? \nIt's a photo-lineup with a photo of [Petitioner]. \nAnd did you show -is that what you showed \nMs. Romeo on the park bench? \nI did. \nAnd there's some words written by the various \npictures. Is that right? \nYes, sir. \nAnd did you write those words? \nI did. \nAnd did you write them while you were \ninterviewing her on the park bench? \nI did. \nAnd are those words that she said or words \nthat you were saying. \nThose are words she said, and I wrote them \ndown for the individuals. \nDuring the Rule 61 remand, Detective Conner was asked \"whether it was possible that as he \nwas preparing the case for trial, he just added the word 'shooter' to State's Exhibit 84 because that's \nwhat he recalled Romeo saying.\" (D.I. 18-11 at 16) As summarized by the Superior Court on \nremand, \nDet. Conner responded, \"[b]eing over the course of time, sitting here \ngoing over this, my gut tells me no, but obviously, I'm thinking it over \nnow. But I have to go with my gut.\" Upon further questioning, \nhowever, Det. Conner amended his answer and said, \"I'm going to \n28 have to say it's possible.\" At the conclusion of his testimony at the \nhearing, Det. Conner finalized his explanation of the discrepancy as \nfollows: \nANSWER: \n* I do not recall ever going back to that photo \narray and writing \"shooter .\" [(D.I. 31-5 at 14)] \n* \nQUESTION: Okay. And so you -as you stand here today, \nlooking back, you can't explain how the word \n\"shooter\" appears on the original, but does not \nappear on the copy of the original that you \nmade? \nANSWER: Do I know why it's not there? \nQUESTION: Yes. \nANSWER: All I know is I didn't delete it. \nQUESTION: Okay. And it's possible that you added \n\"shooter\" on the original, as you previously \ntestified? \nANSWER: My gut says no, but I'm going to say is it a \npossibility? Yes, but I don't believe that's the \ncase. * \n(D.I. 18-11 at 16; D.I. 31-5 at 14) \"The [Superior] Court questioned Det. Conner as to what his \nnote in Court Exhibit 3 stating 'Id'd [Petitioner]' meant, to which he explained that it meant Romeo \nidentified the individual in position Number 3 as the shooter wearing the brown sweatshirt with the \nwhite lettering that went by her with Troy Faison.\" (D.I. 18-11 at 17) \nDetective Conner's testimony during the evidentiary hearing raises the possibility that he was \nconfused about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on the array, which could also lead to the \nconclusion that his testimony on voir dire was due to the same confusion or faulty memory and was \nnot intentionally false. If Detective Conner did not have a \"willful intent\" to deceive when he \n29 testified, then his testimony would not constitute perjury. However, having accepted as correct the \nDelaware state courts' factual determination that Detective Conner wrote the word \"shooter\" on the \nphoto array sometime after the discovery copy of the array was provided to the defense but before \nthe trial commenced,18 and comparing that factual determination with Detective Conner's voir dire \ntestimony in the aforementioned excerpt, the Court is constrained to conclude that Detective \nConner falsely testified on voir dire by stating that he wrote the word \"shooter\" on the array when he \ninterviewed Romeo.19 \n18The Superior Court made this factual finding after hearing Detective Conner's statement regarding \nhis \"gut\" feeling about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" and witnessing his demeanor, and still \nmade the factual finding that Detective Conner wrote the word \"shooter\" after his interview of \nRomeo. Recently, the Third Circuit reiterated that '\"[a]ssessments of witness credibility ... are \nwrapped up in evaluations of demeanor that a trial judge is in a better position to decide,' and we \ndefer to such assessments unless there is clear error.\" C. G. B. v. Lucia, 755 F. App'x 123, 126 (3d \nCir. 2018) (quoting United States v. Brown, 631 F.3d 638, 643 (3d Cir. 2011)). \n19The State does not address whether Detective Conner's testimony constituted perjury. For \ninstance, with respect to Claim One, the State entirely avoids the issue by focusing on the standard \nof review to be accorded to the Superior Court's factual determinations on remand, none of which \ndealt with the issue of Detective Conner's false testimony or the State's knowledge of that falsity. \nAs for Claim Two (A)'s allegation that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by admitting \nthe altered photo array and failing to correct Detective Collins' perjured testimony, the State \ncontends that the argument is procedurall y defaulted and only briefly addresses the issue on the \nmerits -asserting there was no prosecutorial misconduct because the State discovered and revealed \nthe discrepancy between the two photo arrays during the Rule 61 appeal, stating: \nThe Delaware Supreme Court found that during the pendency of the \nappeal of the Superior Court's denial of postconviction relief, \"the \nState learned that there was a discrepancy between the photo array that \nRomeo used to identify [Petitioner], which the State admitted at trial, \nand the copy the State had sent to [Petitioner's] attorney in discovery.\" \nBy making this finding, supported by the record and conceded by \n[Petitioner], the Delaware Supreme Court implicitly found that no \nprosecutorial misconduct at trial occurred, and thus the analysis ends. \n(D.I. 27 at 18) However, the fact that the State discovered the discrepancy while preparing for \nPetitioner's post-conviction appeal and revealed it to the Delaware Supreme Court does not address \n30 Having determined that Detective Conner falsely testified, the next issue is whether the State \nknew or should have known that Detective Conner's testimony was false. The record demonstrate s \nthat the State was not actually aware at the time of Petitioner's trial that Detective Conner falsely \ntestified during the \u00a7 3507 voir dire about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84.20 \nHowever, since the State provided the discovery copy of the photo array to the defense prior to the \ntrial (which did not have the word \"shooter\" on it) and then used and admitted State Exhibit 84 \nduring the trial (which did have the word \"shooter\" on it),21 the Court concludes that the State \nshould have known that there was a discrepancy between the discovery copy of the photo array and \nState Exhibit 84. In turn, given the Delaware State courts' factual determination (and this Court's \nacceptance of that factual determination ) that Detective Conner wrote the word \"shooter\" on State \nExhibit 84 after the State provided the discovery copy of the photo array to the defense, the Court is \nconstrained to conclude that the State should have known that Detective Conner's testimon y on voir \ndire was false.22 \nthe State's failure to discover and address the discrepanc y and correct the perjury during Petitioner 's \ncriminal trial. \n2\u00b01'he State has provided excerpts of the transcript from the evidentiary hearing on remand, but not \nthe entire transcript. The Court's conclusion that the State did not knowingl y provide two \ninconsistent photo arrays is based on those excerpts. \n21During the Rule 61 remand, Detective Conner explained that \"he retained sole custody of State's \nExhibit 84 until he turned it over to the prosecutor as evidence, at some point at or near trial. The \nprosecutor would then present it to him during his testimony for identification.\" (D.I. 18-11 at 15) \n22It is well-established that a \"prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable [defense] evidence \nknown to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police,\" and that a \ngovernment agent's knowledge of exculpatory evidence is imputed to the prosecution. Kjles v. \nWhitley, 514 U.S. 419 at 437-438 (1995); see also Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280-81. However, neither the \nSupreme Court nor the Third Circuit have expressly recognized or rejected the principle that the \nfalse testimony provided by a police officer should be imputed to the prosecution. See, e.g., Reis\u00ad\nCampos v. Biter, 832 F.3d 968, 977 (9th Cir. 2016) (''While the Supreme Court has clearly established \nthat the prosecution's Bracfy duty encompasses evidence known only to police investigators and not \n31 11. Whether the false testimony went uncorrected \nThe State appears to suggest that it \"corrected\" Detective Conner's false testimony during \nthe Rule 61 proceeding when it discovered the discrepanc y between the two photo arrays and \nrequested an evidentiary hearing on the issue. For instance, the State asserts: \nThe Delaware Supreme Court found that during the pendency of the \nappeal of the Superior Court's denial of postconviction relief, \"the \nState learned that there was a discrepanc y between the photo array that \nRomeo used to identify [Petitioner] , which the State admitted at trial, \nand the copy the State had sent to [Petitioner's] attorney in discovery.\" \nBy making this finding, supported by the record and conceded by \n[Petitioner], the Delaware Supreme Court implicitly found that no \nprosecutorial misconduct at trial occurred, and thus the analysis ends. \n(D.I. 27 at 18) To the extent the Court correctly understands the State's argument, it is unavailing. \nThe relevant issue is whether the false testimony went uncorrected during the trial at which it \noccurred; not whether it went uncorrected when discovered at a later date. See Napue, 360 U.S. at \n269 (\"[T]he State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it \nappears.\"); Lambert, 387 F.3d at 242 (noting that when \"the prosecution's case includes perjured \ntestimony and the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury ... [or] when the \ngovernment, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears at \ntrial[,] ... the conviction must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false \nto the prosecutor, it is not clearly established that a police officer's knowledge of false testimony \nmay be attributed to the prosecution under Napue.\"). In this case, the Court does not need not to \naddress whether knowledge of Detective Conner's testimony is imputed to the State, because the \nexistence of the discrepanc y between the discovery photo array and State Exhibit 84, along with the \nfact that both documents were provided by the State, demonstrates that the State should have \nknown something was amiss with Detective Conner's voir dire testimony regarding the time at which \nhe wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84. \n32 testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\"). In this case, there is no doubt that the \nState did not correct Detective Conner's false testimony during Petitioner's trial. \nTo summarize the analysis to this point, Petitioner has satisfied the first three elements of a \nNapue/prosecutorial misconduct claim: (1) Detective Conner lied when he testified during the \n\u00a7 3507 voir dire that he wrote the word \"shooter\" on the photo array during his interview of Romeo; \n(2) the State should have known that Detective Conner lied because it had access to both versions of \nthe photo array; and (3) the State did not correct Detective Conner's testimony during the trial. The \nfinal element for the Court to consider is whether Detective Conner's false testimony was material. \niii. Materiality \nFor the purpose of a perjury analysis, testimony is material \"if there is any reasonable \nlikelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\" Haskell, 866 F.3d \nat 149. Petitioner first contends that Detective Conner's false testimony on voir dire was material \nbecause \"the trial court would not have had a basis under ... \u00a7 3507 to allow in Conner's testimony \nthat Romeo had identified [Petitioner] as the shooter\" (D.I. 37 at 5-6) if it had known that the word \n\"shooter\" was not written contemporaneousl y with Detective Conner's interview of Romeo (D.I. 37 \nat 16). He asserts that Romeo's \u00a7 3507 statement would not have been admissible if Detective \nConner had ben truthful. (D.I. 37 at 16) According to Petitioner, \"the jury would not have heard \nthat Romeo identified [Petitioner] as the shooter, just that she identified him,\" which would have \nbeen \"less damaging\" to Petitioner. (D .I. 18-11 at 27) \nContrary to Petitioner's assertion, this argument does not demonstrate the materiality of \nDetective Conner's perjured testimony . During the Rule 61 remand, the Superior Court determined \nthat Detective Conner's notes were taken contemporaneousl y with his interview of Romeo, and that \nthose notes \"were a sufficient reflection of Romeo's words during the interview to satisfy \u00a7 3507 .\" \n33 (Id. at 34) After noting that \"Romeo did identify [Petitioner] as the shooter during her interview \nwith Det. Conner\" (id.), the Superior Court concluded that \"whether the word 'shooter' was actually \nwritten contemporaneous with the statement or later added is irrelevant under [the] admissibility \nanalysis of\u00a7 3507, because the dispositive fact in that analysis is that Ms. Romeo did say the word \n'shooter' in her statement (id. at 35). In other words, Romeo's \u00a7 3507 statement, presented via \nDetective Conner's testimony, would have been admitted even if the discrepancy between the \ndiscovery copy of the photo array and State Exhibit 84 had been discovered during the \u00a7 3507 voir \ndire.23 \nThe Delaware Supreme Court affinned the Superior Court's remand decision on post-\nconviction appeal. First, the Delaware Supreme Court determined that there was \"ample evidence\" \nto support the [Superior] [C]ourt's determination\" that Romeo identified Petitioner as the shooter \nduring her interview with Detective Conner, including: (1) the fact that Detective Conner testified \nconsistently about the substance of Romeo's statements at trial and at the Rule 61 evidentiary \nhearing; (2) the fact that defense counsel was aware that Romeo had identified Petitioner as the \nshooter before the trial and expected her testify to that fact during the trial; and (3) the fact \nDetective Conner's police report and affidavit of probable cause, which were written long before \ntrial, reflect Romeo's pretrial identification of Petitioner as the shooter. See Collins, 2016 WL \n2585782, at *5. The Delaware Supreme Court then concluded that: \nThe fact that Detective Conner did not write the word \"shooter\" on \nthe photo array contemporaneously with Romeo's statement, though \nimprudent, does not transform his trial testimony into an interpretive \nnarrative. The law requires that the detective accurately represent the \n2Yfhe Superior Court did not explicitly state that Detective Conner's testimony would have been \nadmitted even if the discrepancy had been discovered. However, it implicitly endorsed that view by \nstating, \"[w]ith this analysis, the Court finds that the outcome at trial, had Trial Counsel realized the \ndiscrepancy and objected to it, would not have been any different.\" (D.I. 18-11 at 35) \n34 witness's actual statement and not give a personal interpretation of the \nstatement. In this case, Romeo identified [Petitioner] as \"the shooter\" \nduring the interview . Therefore, the Superior Court properly \ndetermined that the statement was not an interpretive narrative. \nCollins, 2016 WL 2585782, at 5. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court rejects Petitioner 's argument that Romeo's \u00a7 3507 \nstatement would not have been admissible if Detective Conner had been truthful. Therefore, \nPetitioner's first attempt to demonstrate the materiality of Detective Conner's testimon y regarding \nwhen he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84 is unavailing. \nNext, Petitioner contends that Detective Conner's perjured testimony was material because \nrevealing Detective Conner's actions \"would have destroyed Detective Conner's credibility and, as a \nresult, the credibility of the prosecution itself.\" (D.I. 37 at 17) Again, the Court disagrees . During \nthe Rule 61 remand, the Superior Court heard Detective Conner's possible explanations for the \ndiscrepancy and had an opportunity to observe Detective Conner's demeanor and assess his \ncredibility . Notably, even after finding that Detective Conner did not write the word \"shooter\" on \nState Exhibit 84 contemporaneousl y with his interview of Romeo, the Superior Court still concluded \nthat Romeo identified Petitioner as the shooter during her interview with Detective Conner and \nviewed as irrelevant the timing of Detective Conner's alteration of State Exhibit 84. If the timing of \nDetective Conner's alteration to State Exhibit 84 did not affect the substance of Romeo's \u00a7 3507 \nstatement for admissibility purposes, it logically follows that Detective Conner's testimon y regarding \nthe timing of his alteration did not affect the substance of Romeo's \u00a7 3507 statement. In addition, \nanother eyewitness, Violet Gibson, provided a recorded statement to Detective Conner that \nimplicated Petitioner in the murders. \n35 Given Gibson's identification, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the \njury would not have convicted him without Romeo's identification. Consequently, while the falsity \nof Detective Conner's testimony about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84 may \nhave been used to impeach Detective Conner's credibility, the falsity of Detective Conner's \ntestimony would not have \"destroyed the credibility\" of Romeo's identification of Petitioner or the \ncredibility \"of the prosecution itself' (D.I. 37 at 17), especially since there was another identification \nof Petitioner. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the State did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct \nby presenting Detective Conner's perjured testimon y. Instead, that testimony was not material. \nb. Prosecutorial misconduct/ Bradyviolation based on Detective \nConner's falsified evidence \nPetitioner also argues that the State violated Bracfy v. Maryland and committed prosecutorial \nmisconduct when it failed to disclose Detective Conner's falsification of State Exhibit 84. (D.I. 37 at \n18) To reiterate, a petitioner establishes a Bracfy violation by showing that: (1) the evidence at issue \nwas favorable to the accused, either because it was exculpatory or it had impeachment value: (2) the \nprosecution suppressed the evidence, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) the evidence was \nmaterial. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281-82. Once again, however, since the defense had access to the \nunaltered discovery copy of the photo array and the altered copy of the photo array that was \nadmitted at trial (State Exhibit 84), Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the State knowingly or \ninadvertently suppressed the fact that Detective Conner altered State Exhibit 84. Accordingly, the \nCourt will deny as meritless the portion of Claim Two (A) premised on Bracfy. \n36 C. Claims Two (B) and (C): Prosecutorial Misconduct \nIn Claim Two (B), Petitioner asserts that the State \"committed misconduct during its \nopening statements when it proffered evidence that the owner of the car -Brineka Neal-would tell \nthe jury, among other things, that [Petitioner] had possession of her car at the time of the shooting, \nthat she could not reach him on the phone, and that there was something different about the way he \nreturned the car to her this time. The State never presented that witness.\" (D.I. 37 at 49) In Claim \nTwo (C), Petitioner contends that the State misrepresented \"the facts of the eyewitnesses' out-of\u00ad\ncourt statements\" and also improperly vouched for witness Gibson. (D.I. 18 at 32; D.I. 37 at 52) \nThe State asserts, and Petitioner concedes, that Petitioner did not present Claims Two (B) and (C) to \nthe Delaware Supreme Court on direct appeal or post-conviction appeal, and that he cannot present \nthe arguments in a new Rule 61 motion at this juncture. (D.I. 27 at 15-20; D.I. 37 at 43-53) As \nsuch, the two prosecutorial misconduct arguments are procedurall y defaulted, which means that the \nCourt cannot review their merits absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or a showing that the \nCourt should review their merits in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. \nIn his Reply, Petitioner cites Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1, 9 (2012), and attempts to establish \ncause for his default of Claims Two (B) and (C) by blaming post-conviction counsel's failure to raise \nthe prosecutorial misconduct arguments asserted therein during his Rule 61 proceeding. (D.I. 37 at \n45-49) In Martinet 566 U.S. at 16-17, the Supreme Court held that inadequate assistance of counsel \nduring an initial-review state collateral proceeding may establish cause for a petitioner's procedural \ndefault of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In order to obtain relief under Martinet a \npetitioner must demonstrate that: (1) the state post-conviction attorney in his first state collateral \nproceeding was ineffective under the standards established in Strickland; (2) the underlying \nineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is substantial; and (3) petitioner was prejudiced. To show \n37 that a claim is \"substantial\" under Martinet a petitioner must point to evidence demonstrating that \nthe underlying ineffectiveness claim has \"some merit.\" Martinet 566 U.S. at 14. That is, the \npetitioner must submit at least some evidence tending to show that (a) trial counsel performed \ndeficiently in handling some aspect of pretrial or trial duties and (b) the deficient performance \nharmed the defense, in that there is a reasonable probability there would have been a different \noutcome at trial in the absence of counsel's deficient performance . See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695-96. \n\"[W]hether a claim is substantial is a threshold inquiry that does not require full consideration of the \nfactual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\" Bry v. Sup't Greene SCI, 856 F.3d 230, 238 \n(3d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nContrary to Petitioner's argument, Martinez does not provide cause for his default of Claims \nTwo (B) and (C). These two Claims assert prosecutorial misconduct arguments, not arguments that \ntrial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege the prosecutorial misconduct \ndescribed in Claims Two (B) and (C). Therefore, Martinez is inapplicable. \nPetitioner also contends that his default of Claims Two (B) and (C) should be \nexcused because trial and appellate counsel ineffectively failed to object to the prosecutorial \nmisconduct presented in the Claims, and then post-conviction counsel ineffectively failed to assert \nthe ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel Claims in his Rule 61 proceeding .24 This \nmulti-layered ineffective assistance of counsel allegation still does not establish cause for Petitioner's \ndefault. First, since Petitioner did not raise these particular ineffective assistance allegations in his \nRule 61 motion, his ineffective assistance of trial and appellate arguments are themselves \n24In his Amended Petition, Petitioner makes a general assertion that any procedural default should \nbe excused \"because of the ineffective assistance of trial, appellate, and state post-conviction \ncounsel.\" (D.I 18 at 10) \n38 procedurally defaulted, and cannot constitute cause for Petitioner's default of Claims Two (B) and \n(C), unless he can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the procedurally defaulted ineffective \nassistance allegations. See Edwards, 529 U.S. at 453-54; Tome v. Stickman, 2006 WL 357871, at *4 (3d \nCir. 2006). \nSecond, Petitioner unsuccessfull y relies on Martinez v. ~an and attempts to establish cause \nfor his default of the instant ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel arguments by \nblaming post-conviction counsel for not raising the ineffective assistance of trial/ appellate counsel \narguments in his Rule 61 proceeding. The narrow exception articulated in Martinez only applies to \nallegations concerning trial counsel's ineffectiveness, not claims alleging the ineffectiveness of \nappellate counsel. See Davila, 137 S.Ct. at 2065 (declining \"to extend Martinez to allow a federal court \nto hear a substantial, but procedurall y defaulted , claim of ineffective assistance of appellate \ncounsel\"). In turn, Petitioner's reliance on Martinez is unsuccessful for the same reason discussed \nabove, namely, because Claims Two (B) and (C) assert prosecutorial misconduct arguments, not \narguments that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege the prosecutorial \nmisconduct described in Claims Two (B) and (C). See id. (\"On its face, Martinez provides no support \nfor extending its narrow exception [that applies to defaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel \nclaims] to new categories of procedurall y defaulted claims.\"); but see, e.g., Preston v. Sup't Graterford SCI, \n902 F.3d 365 (3d Cir. 2018) (applying Martinez to excuse post-conviction counsel's default of \nPetitioner's defaulted ineffective assistance of counsel claim in order to provide cause to overcome \ndefault of Petitioner's stand-alone Confrontation Clause claim). In other words, Petitioner only \nmentions post-conviction counsel's failure to raise the issue of trial counsel's ineffectiveness as a \nroundabout method to establish cause for his default of his underlying prosecutorial misconduct \narguments. The limited holding of Martinez does not stretch broadly enough to make this argument \n39 meritorious. See Davila, 137 S.Ct. at 2065 (\"On its face, Martinez provides no support for extending \nits narrow exception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims.\"). \nMartinez cannot provide cause for Peri.ti.oner's default of Claims Two (B) and (C) for the \nadditional reason that the underlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel allegations are not \nsubstantial. As explained in Section IV.d.2(d), Peri.ti.oner's argument that trial counsel was \nineffective for failing to move for a mistrial when the State did not present Brineka Neal's testimony \nthat had been mentioned during opening statements lacks merit. Therefore, this particular \nineffective assistance of trial counsel claim is insubstantial and cannot excuse the procedural default \nof Claim Two (B). \nSecond, Peri.ti.oner's argument that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the \nState's inappropriate vouching of Ms. Gibson's recorded out-of-court statement is also insubstantial \nbecause it lacks merit. During the closing in Peri.ti.oner's case, the State argued that while Gibson \nwas a reluctant trial witness, she had made a statement to the police at the ti.me of the murders that \nimplicated Peri.ti.oner. (D.I. 27 at 19) The State asked the jury to evaluate whether the witnesses had \na motive to lie when they were interviewed by the police a few days after the murder (id.), and \nargued: \n(Id. at 20) Now, when you think about it and you recall what you heard during \nthe audio tape of Violet Gibson, didn't she at that ti.me sound like she \nwas trying to help Detective Conner and she was trying to identify who \nshe's seen? That's a credible identification and you should give it great \nweight when you're deliberating about this case. \nIn closing statements, \"[i]t is fundamental that counsel may argue reasonable inferences from \nthe evidence, but may not 'misstate evidence.\" United States v. Fulton, 837 F.3d 281, 306 (3d Cir. \n2016). \"[T]he prosecutor is entitled to considerable latitude in summation to argue the evidence and \n40 any reasonable inferences that can be drawn from that evidence.\" United States v. Scarfo, 685 F.2d \n842, 849 (3d Cir. 1982). The above excerpt from the State's closing argument demonstrates that the \nState did not misstate the content of Gibson's recorded statement but, rather, attempted to draw a \nreasonable inference from it. In short, defense counsel did not perform ineffectivel y by failing to \nobject to the State's closing. \nFor all of the above reasons, the Court concludes that Petitioner has not established cause \nfor his default of Claims Two (B) and (C). In the absence of cause, the Court need not address the \nissue of prejudice . Additionally, Petitioner has not demonstrated that the miscarriage of justice \nexception applies, because he has not provided any new, reliable evidence of his actual and factual \ninnocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims Two (B) and (C) as procedurall y barred from \nfederal habeas review.25 \nD. Claim Three: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel \nPetitioner asserts that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to: (A) notice the \ndiscrepancy between the discovery copy of the photo array and State Exhibit 84; (B) present an \nexpert on the fallibility of eyewitness identification ; (C) request a special jury instruction on \n25Petitioner also appears to believe he asserted a fourth prosecutorial misconduct claim, which he \nrefers to as \"Claim Two (D).\" (D.I. 37 at 43, 53) However, Claim Two (D) in the Amended \nPetition is titled \"D. Conclusion\" and asserts the following: \nThe prosecutorial misconduct throughout trial was severe and \npervasive, prejudicial, and had a substantial and injurious effect on the \nverdict. Initial post-conviction counsel's failure to raise Sections (B) \nthrough (C) above rendered him ineffective, and provides a vehicle for \nthis Court to address these claims under Martinez v. ~an. \n(D.I. 18 at 32-33) Given Petitioner's presentation , the Court views subsection D of Claim Two as \nboth a conclusion for his prosecutorial misconduct arguments and an attempt to demonstrate cause \nfor his default of his prosecutorial misconduct arguments. Consequently, the Court will not address \n\"Claim (D)\" as a separate argument. \n41 eyewitness identification ; (D) conduct an independent investigation; (E) move for a mistrial based \nupon the State's failure to produce Neal as a witness; (F) preserve the record for appeal; and (G) \nobject to the chief investigating officer's testimony about eyewitness Violet Gibson's testimon y. \nThe record reveals, and Petitioner concedes,26 that he only presented Claims Three (A) and (G) to \nthe Delaware state courts, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied Claims Three (A) and (G) as \nmeritless . In turn, the record reveals, and Petitioner concedes, that Claims Three (B) -(F) are \nunexhausted. Given these circumstances, Petitioner will only be entitled to habeas relief for Claims \nThree (A) and (G) if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was either contrary to, or an \nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. As for Claims Three (B) -(F), \nPetitioner is foreclosed from presenting these five Claims in a successive Rule 61 motion, which \nmeans that they are deemed procedurall y defaulted. Consequently, the Court will only be able to \nreview the merits of Claims Three (B) -(F) if Petitioner demonstrates cause for, and prejudice \nresulting from, the procedural default, or if the Court must review the Claims in order to prevent a \nmiscarriage of justice. \n1. Claims Three (A) and (G): reviewed under\u00a7 2254(d) \nThe Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the two-\npronged standard enunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and its progeny. See \nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate \nthat \"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" with \n26Petitioner's Reply only addresses Claims 3 (B) -(F) and argues that they are \"singly and \ncumulatively\" substantial (D.I. 37 at 53) (emphasis added) In the Court's view, the use of this \nterminology demonstrates Petitioner 's implicit acknowledgement of procedural default because he is \nattempting to demonstrate cause for his default of these claims under Martinez. (See D.I. 27 at 25 -\n32) \n42 reasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel rendered \nassistance . Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Although not insurmountable, the Strickland standard is \nhighly demanding and leads to a \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide \nrange of reasonable professional assistance. \" Id. at 689. Under the second Strickland prong, a \npetitioner must demonstrate \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional \nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Id. at 694. A reasonable probability \nis a \"probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id In order to sustain an \nineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must make concrete allegations of actual \nprejudice and substantiate them or risk summary dismissal . See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 \n(3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). \nA court can choose to address the prejudice prong before the deficient performance prong, \nand can reject an ineffective assistance of counsel claim solely on the ground that the defendant was \nnot prejudiced. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698. If the state court only addresses one prong of the \nStrickland test without addressing the merits of the other prong, and the federal court decides to \nconsider the unaddressed prong, the federal court's review of the unaddressed prong must be de novo. \nSee, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 39 (2009) (\"Because the state court did not decide whether \nPorter's counsel was deficient, we review this element of Porter's Strickland claim de novo.\"); Rompilla \nv. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 390 (2005) (applying de novo review where state courts did not reach prejudice \nprong under Strickland). \nTurning to the\u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, a \"state court decision is contrary to clearly established \nfederal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in Supreme Court \nprecedent, or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the \nSupreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that reached by the Supreme \n43 Court.\" Elry v. Erickson, 712 F.3d 837, 846 (3d Cir. 2013). Since the Delaware Supreme Court \ncorrectly identified the Strickland standard in Petitioner 's case, the Delaware Supreme Court's \ndecision was not contrary to clearly established federal law. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 406 (\"[A] run\u00ad\nof-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to the \nfacts of a prisoner's case [does] not fit comfortabl y within\u00a7 2254(d)(1)'s 'contrary to' clause.\"). \nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied the \nStrickland standard to the facts of Petitioner 's case. When performing this second step of the \n\u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court must review the Delaware Supreme Court's denial of Petitioner's \nineffective assistance of counsel claims through a \"doubly deferential\" lens.27 See Hanington v. \u00b7Richter, \n562 U.S. 86, 105 (2011). Notably, when\u00a7 2254(d)(1) applies, \"the question is not whether counsel's \nactions were reasonable, [but rather] whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied \nStrickland's deferential standard.\" Id. When assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is \n\"whether it is reasonabl y likely the result would have been different\" but for counsel's performance, \n27 As explained by the Richter Court, \n[t]he standards created by Strickland and\u00a7 2254(d) are both \"highly deferential,\" and \nwhen the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so. The Strickland standard is a general \none, so the range of reasonable applications is substantial. Federal habeas courts must \nguard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under Strickland with \nunreasonableness under\u00a7 2254(d). \n562 U.S. at 105 (internal citations omitted). The Supreme Court has indicated, but has not explicitly \nstated, that the doubly deferential standard applies to both prongs of a Strickland claim. See, e.g., \nCullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 202 (2011); Knowles v. Mirz.qyance, 556 U.S. 111, 123 (2009). While at \nleast two circuit courts have explicitly held that the \"doubly deferential\" standard applies to both \nStrickland prongs, \"it is an open question in [the Third Circuit] whether [the doubly deferential] \nlanguage applies to the prejudice prong [of Stn'cklandj.\" Lazar v. Sup't Fqyette SCI, 731 F. App'x 119, \n122 n.4 (3d Cir. 2018). Since the Parties did not specificall y brief this issue, and since the Court's \ndecision regarding the ineffective assistance of counsel claims is warranted under the traditional \nAEDPA deference, the Court will not address whether \"double deference\" applies to both prongs \nof the Strickland standard. \n44 and the \"likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\" Id. Finally, when \nviewing a state court's determination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through the lens of\u00a7 2254(d), \nfederal habeas relief is precluded \"so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of \nthe state court's decision.\" Id. at 101. \na. Claim Three (A) \nIn Claim Three (A), Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nfailing to investigate and challenge the admission of State Exhibit 84 and Detective Conner's related \ntestimony regarding Romeo's out-of-court statement . According to Petitioner, if trial counsel had \ndiscovered the discrepancy between the discovery copy of the photo array and State Exhibit 84, trial \ncounsel would have had grounds to exclude the array and/ or impeach Detective Conner's \ntestimony. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court denied Claim Three (A) as meritless after analyzing \nPetitioner's argument under the prejudice prong of Strickland, without addressing whether trial \ncounsel's performance was deficient. Since the Delaware Supreme Court did not consider whether \ntrial counsel's failure to challenge State Exhibit 84 and Detective Conner's related testimony \nconstituted deficient performance, Petitioner contends that the Court must determine if trial \ncounsel's actions constitute deficient performance under a de novo standard of review, but apply \n\u00a7 2254(d) deference to the Delaware Supreme Court's determination of prejudice. If the Court \nfound it necessary to consider the deficient performance prong of Strickland when considering Claim \nThree (A), then it would, as Petitioner correctly asserts, apply a de novo standard of review for the \nperformance prong of Strickland. However, since Petitioner must prove both Strickland prongs in \norder to warrant relief, a court may dispose of an ineffectiveness claim if the petitioner makes an \ninadequate showing as to one prong. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. As explained below, the Court \n45 concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Strickland when holding that \nPetitioner was not prejudiced by trial counsel's performance. Therefore, the Court need not address \nthe performance prong of Strick/and. \nHere, Petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Court incorrectl y applied an \"outcome \ndeterminative \" test for determining prejudice rather than Strick/ands \"reasonable probability\" \nstandard. Petitioner purports to find support for this view in the Delaware Supreme Court's \naffirmance of the following finding of the Superior Court: \nRegardless of when the word \"shooter\" was written on the original \nline-up, Ms. Romeo's identification of (Petitioner] as the shooter \nwould have been introduced in her 350 statement at trial. As such, the \noutcome of the trial, even if Trial Counsel had noticed the discrepanc y \nand raised the issue, would have been the same. \n(D.I. 37 at 30-31) According to Petitioner , \"the [S]tate court held [him] to a higher prejudice \nstandard than Strickland requires,\" thereby requiring the Court to review the prejudice prong de novo. \nThe Court is not persuaded. At the outset of its analysis, the Delaware Supreme Court \nproperly articulated the Stn'ckland standard as follows: \nTo prevail on this claim, [Petitioner] must be able to satisfy the two\u00ad\nprong test from Stn'ckland v. Washington, showing both that his trial \ncounsel's failure to object fell below an objective standard of \nreasonableness and that but for that deficient performance, there was \na reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would \nhave been different; in other words, that there was prejudice to his \ncase. \nCollins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *3. The Delaware Supreme Court then considered the entire record \nbefore deferring to the Superior Court's factual finding on remand \"that Romeo identified \n[Petitioner] as the shooter during her interview, but for some reason Detective Conner failed to \nwrite it on the photo array at that time.\" Id. at *5-6. After deferring to the Superior Court's finding, \nthe Delaware Supreme Court proceeded to consider whether Petitioner demonstrated prejudice \n46 from trial counsel's failure to recognize the discrepanc y. The Delaware Supreme Court ultimately \nconcluded that Detective Conner's police report and affidavit of probable cause reflected sufficient \nadditional pretrial identifications by Romeo which, when added to Gibson's recorded identification , \nprecluded Petitioner from showing it was \"reasonabl y likely the outcome would have been \ndifferent.\" Id. at *5. Given the Delaware Supreme Court's reasoning, the Court concludes that the \nDelaware Supreme Court did not apply a standard requiring a higher showing of prejudice than the \nStrickland standard. \nNext, Petitioner argues that the Superior Court unreasonabl y determined the facts in finding \nthat Petitioner was not prejudiced by trial counsel's performance, because the Superior Court \nignored \"its own stated basis [when denying the original Rue 61 motion] for admitting the \u00a7 3507 \nstatement and the fact that Detective Conner committed perjury,\" as well as \"the impact it would \nhave had on the jury had trial counsel exposed Detective Conner to have committed perjury and \ntampered with the photo line-up.\" (D.I. 37 at 33) The Court has already explained the reason for \nits deference to, and acceptance of, the Delaware state courts' factual finding that Romeo's \u00a7 3507 \nstatement would have been admitted even if the trial court had known about the discrepancy \nbetween the discovery copy of the photo array and State Exhibit 84. (D.I. 18-11 at 33) In addition, \nPetitioner's conclusory and general statement that the exposure of the alteration \"would have armed \ntrial counsel with ample grounds to move for sanctions for misconduct, discovery violations, and for \nmistrial,\" and would have \"destroyed\" Detecti ve Conner's and the State's credibility (D.I. 37 at 34), \ndoes not, without further explanation , demonstrate that impeaching Detective Conner on this basis \nhad a reasonable probability of changing the results of Petitioner 's trial. In this case, the Delaware \nSupreme Court found that \"State Exhibit 84 [the altered photo array] was not the only time where \nDetective Conner recorded that Romeo had identified [Petitioner] as the shooter,\" because \n47 Detective Conner had also noted Romeo's identificati on of Petitioner as the shooter in his affidavit \nof probable cause and in his police report. See Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *5. The Delaware \nSupreme Court also noted that the \"State introduced evidence that gunshot residue and [Petitioner 's] \nDNA were found on the sweatshirt both witnesses saw him wearing.\" Id. \nIn addition, the other witness, Gibson, had also identified Petitioner from a photo array \nprior to trial and the recording of her identification was admitted into evidence. Id. As the Court \nexplained with respect to Claim Two (A),28 given Gibson's recorded identification of Petitioner as \nthe shooter, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the jury would not have \nconvicted him without Romeo's identification . Consequently, while the alteration of State Exhibit \n84 and Detective Conner's related testimony about when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on State \nExhibit 84 certainly could have been used to impeach the detective's credibility, Petitioner has not \ndemonstrated a reasonable probability that exposing the alteration to State Exhibit 84 and/ or \nDetective Conner's related testimony regarding when he wrote the word \"shooter\" on the exhibit \nwould have affected the credibility of Romeo's identification of Petitioner or the credibility \"of the \nprosecution itself.\" (D.I. 37 at 17) \nAfter considering all the circumstances, the Court concludes that Petitioner cannot \ndemonstrate a \"substantial\" likelihood29 that the jury would have disbelieved Romeo's out-of-court \n28See supra Section IV.B.2(a)(iii). \n29In Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. at 112, the Supreme Court stated: \nIn assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question is not whether a \ncourt can be certain counsel's performance had no effect on the \noutcome or whether it is possible a reasonable doubt might have been \nestablished if counsel acted differentl y. Instead, Strick/and asks whether \nit is \"reasonably likely\" the result would have been different. This does \nnot require a showing that counsel's actions \"more likely than not \n48 identification had it known about the discrepanc y between the two photo arrays and Detective \nConner's testimony regarding the word \"shooter\" on State Exhibit 84. Thus, the Delaware Supreme \nCourt reasonabl y applied S tn\u00b7ckland in finding that Petitioner did not establish prejudice and the \nCourt will deny Claim Three (A). \nb. Claim Three (G) \nThe following background information is helpful for understanding Petitioner 's next \nineffective assistance of counsel claim. One of the State's main witnesses, Gibson, lived in the \napartment building across the street from the shooting and was outside at the time. (D.I. 18 at 36) \nAt trial, Gibson testified that she did not see the shooting and could not identify the shooter. She \nconfirmed that she spoke with Detective Conner two days after the shooting in a recorded interview \nand told him that she would not speak to him if it meant that she would have to testify. (D.I. 18 at \n36-37) Gibson testified that she might not have been truthful with Detective Conner during the \ninterview and could not remember much about the events. (D.I. 18 at 37) The State played \nGibson's recorded statement at trial, where she could be heard identifying the person in photograph \nnumber three. See Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *3. Since it was not possible to ascertain who \nGibson was identifying as the shooter without additional information, the trial court permitted \nDetective Conner to testify that the person she identified was Petitioner. See id. Specifically, \nDetective Conner testified that Gibson identified Petitioner's photograph in the array as \"the \nshooter, or the boy with the shooter.\" (D.I. 18 at 37) \"In another part of the recording, Gibson \naltered the outcome,\" but the difference between Strick/ands prejudice \nstandard and a more-probable-than-not standard is slight and matters \n\"only in the rarest case.\" The likelihood of a different result must be \nsubstantial, not just conceivable . \n49 contradicted her earlier identification, stating that [Petitioner] had 'nothing to do with it.\"' Collins, \n2016 WL 2585782, at *3. \nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued that the trial court's admission of Gibson's out-of-court \nstatement into evidence was improper because (1) Gibson did not speak with the police voluntarily, \nsince Detective Conner promised Gibson she would not be called upon to testify in court; and \n(2) Gibson's in-court testimony did not touch on the content of her out-of-court statement. See \nCollins v. States, 56 A.3d 1012, 1018-19 (Del. 2012). The Delaware Supreme Court rejected both \narguments. After noting that \"a purpose of\u00a7 3507 is to allow the admission into evidence of the \nout-of-court statements of turncoat witnesses,\" the Delaware Supreme Court held that Gibson's \nstatements were properly admitted under \u00a7 3507 because \"Gibson's testimony describe her position \nin relation to where the shooting occurred, her reaction to these, and her interaction with Det. \nConner. It was for the jury to assess the credibility of Gibson and Det. Conner, who testified about \nGibson's prior statements.\" Id. at 1019. \nPetitioner re-asserted his challenge to the admission of Gibson's out-of-court statement and \nDetective Conner's related testimony in his Rule 61 proceeding, this time arguing that trial counsel \nhad provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to and move to strike Detective Conner's \ntestimony concerning Gibson's out-of-court identification for constituting either an improper \nnarrative interpretation under \u00a7 3507 or for constituting improper embellishment of Gibson's \nidentification. The Superior Court denied the argument, holding that Petitioner failed to satisfy \neither prong of Strickland because \"Det. Conner's recitation of Gibson's out-of-court statement did \nnot constitute an interpretive narrative , and [Petitioner] has offered no evidence to rebut the \npresumption that trial counsel's trial strategy was reasonable.\" Collins, 2015 WL 412924, at *4. The \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision, holding that Petitioner \"cannot demonstrate that \n50 Detective Conner's statement was an improper interpretive narrative, and therefore cannot show \nthat there was a reasonable probability that an objection would have resulted in a different \noutcome.\" Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *4. \nIn Claim Three (G), Petitioner contends that, contrary to the Delaware Supreme Court's \ndecision, he was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to object to Detective Conner's testimony \nconcerning Gibson's out-of-court identification on the grounds that it \"amounted to an incorrect \nnarrative of [Gibson's] statement.\" (D.I. 18 at 43) Petitioner's argument is unavailing. The \nDelaware Supreme Court concluded that Petitioner could not demonstrate prejudice only after \nconducting a thorough factual analysis as to why Detective Conner's testimony did not constitute a \nnarrative interpretation or improper embellishment. For instance, the Delaware Supreme Court \nnoted that Gibson's recorded statement identified the shooter as a number, rather than by a name, \nand Detective Conner's testimony was necessary to correlate the number to a particular photo in the \narray. The Delaware Supreme Court explained that the need for Detective Conner's explanation did \nnot transform his testimony into an \"interpretive narrative.\" Also, since Gibson had identified \nPetitioner's picture as the \"shooter\" or \"the boy with the shooter,\" the Delaware Supreme Court \nreasonably found \"it was neither narrative interpretation nor embellishment for Detective Conner to \nclarify who Gibson identified in the array.\" Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *4. In addition, since the \njury heard the complete recording of Gibson's identification, including the exculpatory statement \nabout Petitioner \"having nothing to do with it,\" it was reasonable for the Delaware Supreme Court \nto conclude that Detective Conner's testimon y served \"merely to make understandable an \nidentification that would otherwise be meaningless to anyone listening only to the audio recording, \nrather than to put emphasis on any particularl y damning portions of Gibson's statement.\" Id. \n51 Finally, Petitioner's conclusory and unsupported argument in this proceeding that Detective \nConner's testimony amounted to an impermissible narrative or embellishment under \u00a7 3507 does \nnot provide a reason to question the Delaware Supreme Court's resolution of a Delaware evidentiary \nissue. In short, after considering all of the aforementioned circumstances, the Court concludes that \nPetitioner cannot demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the jury would not have convicted him \nbut for trial counsel's failure to object to Detective Conner's testimony about Gibson's statement. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Three (G) for failing to satisfy\u00a7 2254(d). \n2. Claims Three (B), (C), (D), (E), (F): procedurally defaulted \nTo reiterate, the Court cannot review the merits of Claims Three (B) -(F) unless Petitioner \ndemonstrates cause and prejudice, or that a miscarriage of justice will occur without a merits review. \nCiting Martinez v. Ryan, Petitioner contends that post-conviction counsel's failure to raise the instant \nfive Claims constitutes cause for his default. In order to establish \"sufficient prejudice from \ncounsel's ineffective assistance that [a petitioner's] procedural default must be excused under \nMartinez/' a petitioner must show \"that his underlying ineffective assistance-of-trial counsel-claim \nhas some merit and that his state post-conviction counsel's performance fell below an objective \nstandard of reasonableness.\" Workman v. Sup'tA!bion SCI, 915 F.3d 928,941 (3d Cir. 2019). \nWhether a claim has some merit under Martinez is \"analogous to the substantiality requirement for a \ncertificate of appealability.\" Cox v. Horn, 757 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir. 2014). To demonstrate that a \nclaim has some merit, a petitioner must \"show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for \nthat matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the \nissues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\" Workman, 915 F.3d \nat 938 (internal quotation marks omitted). For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that \nPetitioner has failed to demonstrate that his unexhausted claims of ineffective assistance of trial \n52 counsel have \"some merit\" under the standard articulated in Martinez to excuse their procedural \ndefault. However, even if the Court presumed that the claims were sufficient to overcome \nPetitioner's procedural default, the Court would deny them as meritless under Strickland. \na. Failure to call an identification expert \nIn Claim Three (B), Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nfailing to engage the services of an expert identification witness to testify that eyewitness \nidentifications are inherently unreliable and that stress and multiple perpetrators reduce the accuracy \nof eyewitness identifications . (D.I. 18 at 37-38) To support this contention, Petitioner has provided \nan expert report authored by Dr. Julie Buck. In the report, Dr. Buck found that the reliability of \nGibson and Romeo's identifications were limited by the following factors: (1) the witnesses were \nlikely distracted or not attending to the suspects at the pertinent time; (2) multiple suspects were \npresent, a weapon was present, the amount of viewing time was very brief, and the witnesses were \nhighly stressed; (3) Detective Conner did not provide an admonition that the perpetrator may or \nmay not be present in the lineup (at least for Gibson's lineup); and (4) there is some evidence that \nthe Petitioner's face was familiar to Gibson and Romeo because they may have seen Petitioner at \nanother time. (D .I. 19-1 at 7) Dr. Buck also asserted that \"Gibson was likely paying minimal \nattention,\" \"Detective Conner may have influenced [Gibson's] decision to select [Petitioner],\" \"it is \nunclear whether source confusion or a bystander effect could have played a role in this case,\" and \n\"[Petitioner's] photograph was familiar to Ms. Romeo and it may have been difficult to determine \nthe source of that memory of [Petitioner].\" (Id. at 4-5) \nIn contrast, however, evidence admitted during the trial established that Petitioner's DNA \nwas found in the suspect vehicle and also on a unique \"Roca Wear\" sweatshirt that both witnesses \nidentified and which could also be seen on a video admitted at trial on a person running from the \n53 crune scene. Significantly, although Romeo and Gibson identified Petitioner as the shooter in their \npretrial statements, they failed to identify Petitioner at trial. Since the jury heard the inconsistent \ntestimony related to the identification of the shooter, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a reasonable \nprobability that expert testimony such as Dr. Buck 's would have made a difference in the jury's \nverdict. Thus, Claim Three (B) is not substantial enough under Martinez to excuse Petitioner 's \nprocedural default, and also fails to satisfy the prejudice prong of Stn\"ck/and. \nb. Failure to request a special eyewitness jury instruction \nIn Claim Three (C), Petitioner asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a \nspecial jury instruction on the unreliability of eyewitness identification . The trial court provided the \nfollowing jury instruction: \n(D.I. 27 at 28) An issue in this case is the identification of the defendant. \nIdentification is an element of the offense. . . . Before you may find \nthe defendant guilty of any crime, you must be satisfied beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the wrongful conduct charged in this case \nactually took place and the defendant was in fact the individual who \ncommitted that wrongful conduct. . . . If there is any reasonable doubt \nabout the identification of the defendant, you must give him the \nbenefit of such doubt and find him not guilty. \n\"An appraisal of the significance of an error in the instructions to the jury requires a \ncomparison of the instructions which were actually given with those that should have been given.\" \nHenderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154-55 (1977). \"An omission, or an incomplete instruction, is less \nlikely to be prejudicial than a misstatement oflaw.\" Id. at 155. In addition, the \"question in such a \ncollateral proceeding is whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the \nresulting conviction violates due process, not merely whether the instruction is undesirable, \nerroneous, or even universally condemned.\" Id. at 154 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n54 Petitioner criticizes the instruction that was given because \"[e]yewitness identification is \nfallible\" (D.I. 18 at 39), adding that because the \"jury was not instructed about how to evaluate the \nwitnesses' credibility,\" Petitioner suffered prejudice. (D.I. 37 at 56) Notably, however, Petitioner \ndoes not proffer what would have been an acceptable jury instruction or make a specific argument \nabout how the given instruction was insufficient. Petitioner has not, therefore, demonstrated that \nthe instant allegation of ineffective assistance of trial counsel has some merit; he also cannot satisfy \neither prong of Strickland. Thus, Claim Three (C) is not substantial enough under Martinez to excuse \nPetitioner's procedural default and also fails to satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland. \nc. Failure to conduct an independent investigation \nIn Claim Three (D), Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nfailing to interview witnesses, especially Shakira Romeo, prior to trial. According to Petitioner, trial \ncounsel would have been \"prepared to counter the State's attempt to introduce [Romeo's] unswom \nstatements as substantive evidence\" if he had interviewed Romeo prior to trial. (D.I 18 at 39) He \nalso asserts that \"[Romeo] would have told counsel that she never identified [Petitioner] as the \nshooter in the photo array. She would have told counsel that she did not see the shooting. Trial \ncounsel would have been more alert to the 'discrepanc y' with Exhibit 84.\" (D.I. 18 at 39-40) The \nCourt is not persuaded. On direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the admission of \nRomeo's out-of-court statement over trial counsel's objection. See Collins, 56 A.3d at 1019. As the \nDelaware Supreme Court explained, Romeo testified at trial that she was present while the shooting \noccurred and heard the gunshots. Id. She testified that she looked at the photo array and \nrecognized several faces, she remembered she told the officer the truth, but she did not remember \npicking Petitioner out of the array. Id. \n55 Petitioner's speculative assertions about what Romeo would have told trial counsel during an \ninterview do not establish that Claim Three (D) has some merit. They also do not overcome the \nstrong presumption of competenc y and high burden of actual prejudice to prove ineffective \nassistance under Strickland. \nd. Failure to move for mistrial \nIn Claim Three (E), Petitioner asserts that trial counsel should have moved for a mistrial \nwhen the State did not present Brineka Neal's testimony after advising the jury in opening \nstatements that Neal would testify about Petitioner 's use of her vehicle. Petitioner supports this \nargument by contending there was no evidence linking Petitioner to the car. The record belies \nPetitioner's assertion. As the Delaware Supreme Court explained on post-conviction appeal, the \n\"State introduced evidence that the gunshot residue and [Petitioner's] DNA were found on the \nsweatshirt both witnesses saw him wearing,\" and the police found this brown sweatshirt with \"Roca \nWear\" lettering in the suspect vehicle. Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, at *4 (citing Collins, 56 A.3d at \n1016). Moreover, during closing statements, trial counsel told the jury that \"[w]e never heard from \nBernika [sic] Neal, so as far as that testimony is concerned, the Judge will tell you, or proposed \ntestimon y, you have to disregard it.\" (D.I. 27 at 29) Trial counsel used Neal's absence from the trial \nto argue that \"[w]e have no idea how many people had access to that car[,] ... who she loaned it to, \nwho went with her when she drove it.\" (See id.) \nGiven these circumstances , the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed to establish that \nClaim Three (E) has some merit. He has also failed to overcome the strong presumption of \ncompetency and high burden of actual prejudice to prove ineffective assistance under Stri'ckland . \n56 e. Failure to the preserve the record for appeal \nIn Claim Three (F), Petitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to \npreserve the trial record for appeal. According to Petitioner, since the prosecution-generated \ntranscript of Romeo's statement and Gibson's audio-taped statement were not entered into evidence \nat trial, \"the incomplete record on appeal prevented appellate counsel from raising and supporting \nappropriate challenges to the trial court's admission of their statements at trial.\" (D.I. 18 at 41-42) \nPetitioner's contention is incorrect and also fails to demonstrate prejudice. On direct appeal, \nPetitioner argued that Gibson's out-of-court statement was wrongfully admitted into evidence \nbecause \"(1) Gibson did not speak to Detectives voluntarily because Det. Conner promised Gibson \nshe would not be called upon to testify in court, and (2) Gibson's in-court testimony did not touch \non the content of her out-of-court statement .\" Collins, 56 A.3d at 1018-19. In turn, the Delaware \nSupreme Court held that Gibson's statements were properly admitted into evidence under 11 Del. \nCode\u00a7 3507, stating that \"a purpose of\u00a7 3507 [was] to allow the admission into evidence of the out\u00ad\nof-court statements of turncoat witnesses . Gibson's testimony described her position in relation to \nwhere the shooting occurred, her reaction to the shooting, and her interaction with Det. Conner.\" \nId. at 1019. Hence, \"[i]t was for the jury to assess the credibility of Gibson and ofDet. Conner, who \ntestified about Gibson's prior statements.\" Id. \nPetitioner also challenged the admission of Gibson's statement on post-conviction appeal \nfrom his first Rule 61 motion, arguing that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to the \nadmission of the statement as amounting to \"improper embellishment.\" Collins, 2016 WL 2585782, \nat *3. Petitioner argued that \"because Gibson's statement was recorded, only the recording should \nhave been admitted -not Detective Conner's testimony on the substance of the recording. \n[Petitioner] finds this particularly pressing because Detective Conner's testimony 'contradicted' the \n57 recording, and emphasized inculpatory portions (the identification) while ignoring the exculpatory \nstatement about [Petitioner] having 'nothing to do with it.\"' Id. at *4. As previously discussed, the \nDelaware Supreme Court found \"[t]he fact that Gibson's statement needed some explanation \nbecause it was an audio recording of an exchange in which a witness identified a person in a \nnumbered photograph by number does not transform Detective Conner's testimony into an \n'interpretive narrative .\"' Id. (emphasis in original). The Delaware Supreme Court specifically \nacknowledged that \"Gibson had identified Collins' picture as the 'shooter' or 'the boy with the \nshooter.\"' Id. Moreover, since \"the jury heard the complete recording, including the exculpatory \nstatement about [Petitioner] having 'nothing to do with it[,]' Detective Conner's testimony served \nmerely to make understandable an identification that would otherwise be meaningless to anyone \nlistening only to the audio recording, rather than to put emphasis on any particularly damning \nportions of Gibson's statement .\" Id. In short, the Delaware Supreme Court determined that \nPetitioner could not establish his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because he could not \nshow that there was a \"reasonable probability that an objection would have resulted in a different \noutcome.\" Id. \nThis record contradicts Petitioner's contention that the \"Delaware Supreme Court was left \nwith the false impression that Ms. Gibson's statement amounted to a clear identification and that \nDetective Conner's testimony did not misconstrue it.\" (D.I. 18 at 42) Since Petitioner raised and \nargued claims regarding the out-of-court statement, he cannot demonstrate either deficient \nperformance or resulting prejudice. Consequently, Petitioner has failed to overcome his procedural \ndefault of Claim Three (F). \n58 E. Claim Four: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel \nIn Claim Four, Petitioner contends that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nfailing to argue that Detective Conner's narrative interpretation of Romeo's statements was \ninadmissible. Petitioner presented this claim in his post-conviction appeal of his first Rule 61 \nmotion, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied it as meritless. Therefore, Petitioner will only be \nentitled to relief if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable \napplication of, clearly established federal law. \nClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are evaluated under the same Strickland \nstandard applicable to trial counsel. See United States v. Scripps, 961 F.3d 626,632 (3d Cir. 2020) (\"To \nassess the performance of appellate counsel, we apply the two-prong test set forth in Strickland ... \"); \nLewis v. Johnson, 359 F.3d 646, 656 (3d Cir. 2004). An attorney's decision about which issues to raise \non appeal are strategic. See Albrecht v. Horn, 485 F.3d 103, 138 (3d Cir. 2007); Buehl v. Vaughn, 166 \nF.3d 163, 17 4 (3d Cir. 1999) ( counsel is afforded reasonable selectivity in deciding which claims to \nraise without specter of being labeled ineffective). An attorney is not required to raise every possible \nnon-frivolous issue on appeal. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745 (1983); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, \n272 (2000). As a general rule, the presumption of effective assistance of appellate counsel will be \novercome \"only when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented.\" Smith, 528 U.S. at \n285. In order to establish prejudice, a petitioner must show a reasonable likelihood that the court \nwould have resolved the case differentl y on appeal, if not for counsel's deficiencies. See United States \nv. Mannino, 212 F.3d 835, 845 (3d Cir. 2000). \nThe Delaware state courts correctly identified the Stn\u00b7ckland standard applicable to all of \nPetitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Consequently, the Delaware courts' denial of \nClaim Four was not contrary to clearly established federal law. \n59 Nor did the Delaware courts unreasonabl y apply Strickland in denying the instant ineffective \nassistance of appellate counsel claim. On direct appeal, Petitioner 's argument rested \"on the claim \nthat because Romeo denied making the identification of Collins, her testimony did not 'touch on' \nher prior statement.\" Collins, 56 A.3d at 1019. The Delaware Supreme Court found this argument \nmeritless, stating, \"[a] turncoat witness denying a prior statement is a classic example of\u00a7 3507 \napplicability.\" Id. The Delaware Supreme Court held that the Superior Court did not err in \nadmitting Romeo's out-of-court statement via Detective Conner's testimon y, explaining that \"[w]hile \non the witness stand, Romeo described particularities of the shooting, her interactions with the \npolice officers, and the photo array she was shown. Romeo's testimony, although inconsistent with \nher prior statements, sufficientl y did 'touch on' the content of her prior statements.\" Id. \nGiven the Delaware Supreme Court's holding that the trial court properly admitted \nDetective Conner's \u00a7 3507 statement, the Delaware courts reasonabl y applied Strickland in holding \nthat appellate counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to assert a meritless claim. \nAccording ly, the Court will deny Claim Four for failing to satisfy\u00a7 2254(d). \nF. Claim Five: Invalid Allen Charge Jury Instruction30 \nAs the Delaware Superior Court described : \nAfter eleven hours of deliberati on, the jury reported to the trial judge that \nthey were deadlocked. The trial judge gave an Alien charge and instructed \nthe jury to deliberate further. Two hours later, the jury returned the guilty \nverdicts. \n30As previously mentioned, Petitioner expressly abandons the argument presented in the original \nPetition as subsection (B) in Claim Five, namely that the trial court erred for failing to provide a \nspecial eyewitness identification instruction . (D.l. 37 at 58) Therefore, the Court only addresses \nPetitioner's argument concerning the trial court's Alien charge to the jury, which was presented in \nthe original Petition as Claim Five (A). As such, the Court refers to the original \"Claim Five (A)\" as \n\"Claim Five.\" \n60 Collins, 56 A.3d at 1015. An Allen charge is a Supreme Court-approved supplemental jury \ninstruction for deadlocked juries. See Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501 (1896). \nIn Claim Five, Petitioner contends that the Allen charge the trial court provided the jury was \n\"unconstitutionally coercive and violated [Petitioner's] federal constitutional rights. The Supreme \nCourt of Delaware's ruling [on direct appeal] that the trial judge did not commit reversible error in \nproviding the Allen charge was contrary to and an unreasonable application of clearly established \nfederal law, and involved an unreasonable application of facts.\" (D.I. 18 at 47) \nAlthough Petitioner raised the same general argument regarding the coercive nature of the \nAllen charge on direct appeal, Petitioner's appellate argument was more specific and raised four areas \nof concern: (1) \"the wording of the instruction concerning jurors in 'the majority' or 'the minority' \nwas coercive to the minority jurors;\" (2) \"the Allen charge was coercive because the trial judge did \nnot instruct the jurors 'not to render any verdict contrary to the dictates of personal conscience,' as \nthis Court required in Brown v. State,'' 369 A.2d 682, 684 (Del. 1976); (3) \"the trial judge's statement \nthat the jury 'is at liberty to disregard the comments of both the Court and counsel' was improper;\" \nand ( 4) \"the trial court erred in highlighting how many Court resources were devoted to presenting \nthis trial, and that the case 'must be disposed of sometime.\"' Collins, 56 A.3d at 1021-22. \nUnfortunately, in this proceeding, Petitioner does not indicate whether the instant coercive Allen \ncharge claim is premised on the same four specific arguments he presented on direct appeal. \nHowever, as does the State, the Court will exercise prudence and treat Claim Five as though it \npresents the same sub-arguments Petitioner raised on direct appeal. \nOn direct appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court cited Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 and \nexplained that it would review \"for plain error any portion of the charge to which no specific \nobjection was made\" during the trial. Id. at 1020. Since Petitioner did not raise the first three \n61 objections about the Allen charge during trial, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed those three \ncomplaints under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 and held that none of them constituted plain \nerror. As for the fourth complaint, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the trial court did not \nabuse its discretion by highlighting how many Court resources were used in presenting the trial and \nstating that the case \"must be disposed of sometime.\" Id. at 1021. \nDelaware Supreme Court Rule 8 is an independent and adequate state ground that precludes \nfederal habeas review absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or a miscarriage of justice. See \nCampbell v. Burris, 515 F.3d 172, 182 (3d Cir. 2008). In its Answer, the State mentions the Delaware \nSupreme Court's application of the plain error standard of review pursuant to Rule 8 and \nPetitioner's resulting procedural default, asserting that the \"Court cannot consider the claim unless \n[Petitioner] can establish cause for his procedural default and resulting prejudice, or that failure to \nconsider the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\" (D.I. 27 at 35) Then, \nhowever, the State then proceeds to assert that the Delaware Supreme Court \"decided this claim on \nthe merits\" and, therefore, \"habeas relief will only be warranted if the [Delaware Supreme] Court's \ndecision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of Jenkins [v., State, 401 A.2d 83, 87 \n(Del. 1979)] and Allen v. United States, [164 U.S. 492 (1896)], which represents the clearly established \nfederal law governing claims of coercion in supplemental jury charges.\" (D.I. 27 at 35) Given that \nstatement, and the State's ensuing analysis of Claim Five, it appears as though the State has waived \nPetitioner's procedural default of Claim Five. Thus, the Court will review Claim Five under \n\u00a7 2254(d)(1). \nAs noted by the State, Allen v. United States constitutes the clearly established federal law \napplicable to Claim Five. In Allen, the Supreme Court approved the use of a supplemental jury \ninstruction to a deadlocked jury to continue deliberations, observing that such charges were in \n62 accordance with \"the very object of the jury system ... to secure unanimity by a comparison of \nviews.\" 164 U.S. at 501-02. Normally, a supplemental instruction which encourages the jury to \nreach a unanimous verdict is entirely appropriate . See, e.g., Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 237-39 & \nn.1 (1988). \"For this reason, an Allen charge delivered to a jury during state criminal proceedings \ngenerally fails to warrant federal habeas relief unless the supplemental charge was so unfair or \ncoercive that it rendered the entire trial fundamentall y unfair.\" Desmond v. S rryder, 1999 WL \n33220036, at *5 (D. Del. Nov. 16, 1999). When determining if an Allen charge was coercive, a court \nmust consider the charge \"in its context and under all the circumstances .\" Lowenfield, 484 U.S. at \n237; see also United States v. Fioravanti, 412 F.2d 407 (3d Cir. 1969) (considering whether Allen charge \nin \"the context in which it was presented\" was \"so prejudicial as to deprive appellant of a fair trial \nand a unanimous verdict based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt\"). An Allen charge will be \nfound to be unduly coercive \"where the charge caused the jury to be influenced by concerns \nirrelevant to their task and [where the jury] reached its subsequent verdict for reasons other than the \nevidence presented to it.\" United States v. Jackson, 443 F.3d 293, 297 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued that the Allen charge in his case was coercive because it \nwas \"remarkably similar to another charge\" that the Third Circuit held to be unnecessarily coercive \nin United States v. Eastern Medical Billing, 230 F.3d 600 (3d Cir. 2000). (D.I. 18-4 at 19) As discussed \nin more depth below, Petitioner then premised all four of his appellate Allen charge sub-arguments \non the reasoning in Eastern Medical Billing.31 (D.I. 18-4; see also Collins, 56 A.3d at 1021) While it \nappears that \"the Allen charge given here was the pattern instruction regularly used by the Superior \n31Petitioner's 60-page Reply did not address the State's argument concerning Claim Five. \n63 Court,\"32 \"modified only in ways requested by [Petitioner at trial],\"33 neither Party has provided a \ncopy of the slightly \"modified\" pattern Allen charge for the Court's review.34 \n1. Trial court's use of majority/minority language \nThe trial court's Allen charge \"asked both the majority and minority jurors to re-examine \ntheir views\" and \"used different phrasing in addressing the majority jurors than ... used in \naddressing the minority jurors.\" Collins, 56 A.3d at 1021. On direct appeal, Petitioner contended \nthat the wording of the instruction concerning jurors in \"the majority\" or \"the minority\" was \ncoercive because it was \"remarkably similar\" to the Allen instruction the Third Circuit \"found \nunnecessarily coercive\" in Eastern Medical Billing, Inc. See Collins, 56 A.3d at 1021. Petitioner argued \nthat, \"as in Eastern Medical Billing, the majority jurors, unlike the minority jurors, were not instructed \nto re-examine their views.\" (D.I. 18-4 at 20) However, the Delaware Supreme Court noted that the \nThird Circuit's disapproval of the majority/ minority distinction in Eastern Medical Billing was based \non its supervisory power over the federal district courts and not on constitutional grounds. See \nCollins, 56 A.3d at 1021. The Delaware Supreme Court also noted that the federal circuits are split as \nto whether the majority/ minority distinction is coercive, explaining: \nAn Allen charge that instructs the majority and the minority to re\u00ad\nexamine their views has been approved in the First, Fourth, Sixth, and \nEighth Circuits. The Allen charges approved by these circuits differed \nin their wording, but each drew a distinction between majority and \nminority jurors and in some fashion asked both groups to reconsider \ntheir views. Importantly, each of those circuits found repeated \nwarnings -as was done here -that jurors not give up their individual \n32 (D.I. 31-2 at 25) \n33 (D.I. 31-2 at 22) \n34The Delaware courts website contains a copy of the Superior Court of Delaware Criminal Pattern \nJury Instructions. See https://courts.delaware.gov /superior/pattern/pattern criminal.asp x. The \npattern Allen instruction is\u00a7 4.40 \"Jury Unable to Agree -'Allen' Charge\"'. \n64 Id convictions, diminished the risk that the majority/ minority distinction \nmight be coercive. The Seventh and the District of Columbia Circuits \nagree with the Third Circuit that any majority/minority distinction is \ncoercive. \nAlthough these approaches suggest that any instruction using the \nmajority/minority distinction is best avoided, the divergent federal \nprecedent persuades us that it was not plain error for the trial judge \nto make the distinction in his Allen charge in this case. The error in \nwording-if there was one -was neither plain nor obvious. \nWhen reviewing a habeas claim under\u00a7 2254(d)(1), the \"clearly established law\" by which a \nclaim is measured is Supreme Court caselaw. The fact that there is a circuit split on the issue of the \ncoercive effect of an Allen charge's minority/ majority distinction demonstrates that there is no \nSupreme Court precedent prohibiting such a distinction . In fact, in Lowenjield v. Phelps, the Supreme \nCourt noted that the jury instruction at issue in Allen was constitutional despite containing a \nminority/ majority distinction: \nThe use of a supplemental charge has long been sanctioned. Nearly a \ncentury ago in Allen v. United States, this Court reviewed a charge similar \nbut by no means identical to that given to the Louisiana jury here, and \nconcluded that it was not reversible error even within the federal \nsystem. The defendant in that case had been sentenced to death by \nJudge Parker in the Western District of Arkansas, exercising a \njurisdiction unique among federal courts. The judge's charge is not set \nout verbatim in the opinion of this Court, but it differed from the \ncharge given in the present case in that the Allen charge urged \nthe minority to consider the views of the majority, and ask themselves \nwhether their own views were reasonable under the circumstances. \nThis Court upheld the conviction and sentence against the defendant 's \nclaim of coercion, saying: \nThe very object of the jury system is to secure \nunanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments \namong the jurors themselves . It certainly cannot be the \nlaw that each juror should not listen with deference to \nthe arguments and with a distrust of his own judgment, \nif he finds a large majority of the jury taking a different \n65 view of the case from what he does himself. It cannot \nbe that each juror should go to the jury room with a \nblind determination that the verdict shall represent his \nopinion of the case at that moment; or, that he should \nclose his ears to the arguments of men who are equally \nhonest and intelligent as himself. \nThe continuing validity of this Court's observations in Allen are \nbeyond dispute, and they apply with even greater force in a case such \nas this, where the charge given, in contrast to the so-called \n\"traditional Allen charge,\" does not speak specifically to \nthe minority jurors. \n484 U.S. 231, 237-38 (1988). \nAdditionally, and of particular significance in this case, when distinguishing the Supreme \nCourt precedent on which the petitioner in Lowen.field had relied to demonstrate the coercive effect \nof the Allen charge (Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445 (1965)), the Lowen.field Court explained that \nJenkins was of no help because Jenkins \"was based on our supervisory power over the federal courts \n... and not on constitutional grounds.\" Lowen.field, 484 U.S. at 551 n.2. This distinction between \nsupervisory powers and constitutional grounds is the same distinction the Delaware Supreme Court \nrelied on in Petitioner's appeal to distinguish the Allen charge that was disapproved of in Eastern \nMedical Billing. See Collins, 56 A.3d at 1021. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the \nDelaware Supreme Court did not unreasonabl y apply clearly established federal law in rejecting \nPetitioner's argument about the Allen charge's reference to the majority/minority distinction. \n2. Absence of curative language regarding personal conscience \nPetitioner also argued on direct appeal that the Allen charge was coercive because the trial \njudge did not instruct the jurors \"not to render any verdict contrary to the dictates of personal \nconscience.\" Collins, 56 A.3d at 1021. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected this argument and \nheld that sufficient admonition was given to the jurors to maintain their personal convictions, given \nthat the \"trial judge expressly admonished the jurors that they should not do 'violence to the [their] individual judgment and conscience\"' and they \"should not surrender [their] conscientious \nconvictions,\" in various forms, four times during the Allen charge. Id. at 1022. \nIn United States v. Brennan, the Third Circuit explained that \"a charge would not be coercive if \nit contained language urging the jurors to re-examine their own view but not to 'surrender [their] \nhonest conviction as to the weight or effect of evidence solely because of the opinion of [their] \nfellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\"' 326 F.3d 176, 192-93 (3d Cir. \n2003); see also United States v. Alper, 449 F.2d 1223, 1234 (3d Cir. 1971) (holding that supplemental \njury charge suggesting jurors re-examine their views was not unduly coercive because it also told \njurors not to surrender their honest convictions) . Given the trial court's repeated reminders and \ncautions emphasizing to the jury that they must adhere to their individual convictions, the Court \nconcludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Allen and its progeny when rejecting \nthe instant argument . \n3. Statement regarding liberty to disregard comments of trial court and \ncounsel \nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued it was improper for the trial court to advise the jury it \"is \nat liberty to disregard the comments of both the [trial c]ourt and counsel.\" Collins, 56 A.3d at 1022. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court rejected this argument based on well-settled Delaware precedent \nestablished in Smith v. State, 839 A.2d 666 (Table), 2003 WL 22931398, at *2-3 (Del. Dec. 9, 2003), \nand Maxion v. State, 612 A.2d 158 (Table), 1992 WL 183093, at *1 (Del. 1992). See Collins, 56 A.3d at \n1022. In Smith, the Delaware Supreme Court found that the trial judge was merely reminding the \njury that it was \"part of its duty to assess the credibility of all witnesses\" and, in doing so, it could \n\"disregard comments of counsel (or even the [trial c]ourt) that, in the process of weighing the \nevidence, it found were not credible.\" 2003 WL 22931398, at *3. In Maxion, the Delaware Supreme \n67 Court noted that, when viewed in context, the language to \"disregard\" created no threat of coercion, \nwhen \"coupled with repeated reminders to the jury to not surrender their convictions unless they \nbelieved them to be erroneous.\" Collins, 56 A.3d at 1022. Notably, the reason the Third Circuit \ngenerally advised against stating the jury could disregard comments of both the trial court and \ncounsel was to \"avoid comments that are not clear and that could be interpreted to alter the \ninstructions previously given to the jury.\" Eastern Medical Billing, 230 F.3d at 614. In this proceeding, \nPetitioner has not provided any reason for the Court to question the Delaware Supreme Court's \ndetermination on this issue, especially when the trial court \"reminded [the jurors] several times not \nto violate their individual judgment and conscience.\" (D.I. 31-2 at 25) \n4. Statement regarding resources devoted to trial \nFinally, Petitioner argued on direct appeal that the trial court erred in highlighting how many \ncourt resources were devoted to presenting his trial, and that the case \"must be disposed of \nsometime.\" Collins, 56 A3d at 1022. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected this argument, citing \nPapantinas v. State for the proposition that a court's statement that the case \"must be disposed of \nsometime\" is permissible so long as it is accompanied by repeated reminders that individual jurors \nshould not \"surrender his or her individual judgment or honest convictions.\" 820 A.2d 372 (Table), \n2003 WL 1857548, at *1-2 (Del. Apr. 8, 2003). Given the curative language contained in the Allen \ncharge in Petitioner's case, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not \nunreasonably apply clearly established federal law in denying the instant argument. \nBased on the foregoing, when viewed as a whole, the trial court's Allen charge was not \ncoercive or prejudicial to Petitioner, and did not violate his due process rights. Therefore, the Court \nwill deny Claim Five in its entirety. \n68 G. Claim Six: Cumulative Error \nIn his final Claim, Petitioner asserts that, \"even if the Court finds that [he] is not entitled to \nrelief based on any single claim, he is entitled to relief because of the cumulative effect of these \nerrors. Collectively, the errors raised in this petition resulted in a fundamentally unjust conviction \nand sentence.\" (D.I. 18 at 48) The record reveals that Petitioner did not present a cumulative error \nclaim to the Delaware state courts. As a result, the State contends that the Court cannot review this \nprocedurall y defaulted claim. (D.I. 27 at 40) While Petitioner implicitly concedes that Claim Six is \nprocedurally defaulted, he asserts that: (1) exhaustion is not required; and (2) if exhaustion is \nrequired, he can overcome any procedural default based on post-conviction counsel's \nineffectiveness. (D.I. 37 at 58-59) \nThe United States Supreme Court has not recognized the concept of cumulative error on \nhabeas review. See Bush v. Carpenter, 926 F.3d 644,686 n.16 (10th Cir. 2019). Since there is no clearly \nestablished federal law with respect to a cumulative error argument, arguably the Court's analysis is \nover, and Petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief for Claim Six. \nThe Third Circuit, however, has recognized the cumulative error doctrine on habeas review, \nholding that \"a cumulative error argument constitutes a stand-alone constitutional claim subject to \nexhaustion and procedural default.\" Collins v. Secy of Pa. Dep't of Corr. 742 F.3d 528, 542 (3d Cir. \n2014). Pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine, \n[i]ndividual errors that do not entitle a petitioner to relief may do so \nwhen combined, if cumulativel y the prejudice resulting from them \nundermined the fundamental fairness of his trial and denied him his \nconstitutional right to due process. Cumulative errors are not \nharmless if they had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in \ndetermining the jury's verdict, which means that a habeas petitioner is \nnot entitled to relief based on cumulative errors unless he can establish \nactual prejudice. \n69 Faf?y v. Horn, 516 F.3d 169, 205 (3d Cir. 2008). Given the Third Circuit's recognition of \nthe cumulative error doctrine in habeas proceeding s, the Court will review Claim Six. \nHere, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed and rejected each alleged underlying error on \nits merits or as procedurall y barred. As previously discussed, this Court has also concluded that the \nClaims either lack merit and did not cause any prejudice , or are procedurall y barred. Since Petitioner \nhas not provided anything to demonstrate \"actual prejudice \" even when the Five Claims are \nconsidered together, the Court will deny Claim Six as meritless. \nV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether to \nissue a certificate of appealability . See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A \ncertificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \"substantial showing of the \ndenial of a constitutional right\" by demonstrating \"that reasonable jurists would find the district \ncourt's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also \nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,484 (2000). \nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. Reasonable jurists \nwould not find this conclusion to be debatable . Accordingly, the Court will not issue a certificate of \nappealability . \nVI. CONCLUSIO N \nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the Petition must be denied. An \nappropriate Order will be entered. \n70 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSOLOMON COLLINS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \nDANA METZGER, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE, \nRespondents . Civil Action No. 16-751-LPS \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this 7th day of February, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum Opinion issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Petitioner Solomon Collins' Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.I. 2; D.I. 18) is DISMISSED , and the relief requested therein is DENIED . \n2. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner has \nfailed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Clerk shall close the case. \nUNITE STATES DISTRICT JUDGE "}
