(collectively \n\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a complaint challenging several recently enacted Delaware statutes as \nunconstitutional .  (D.I. 1) .  Soon thereafter, they filed a motion for a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction, seeking to enjoin Defendant from enforcing those statu tes.  (D.I.  5).  Defendant has \nmoved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim.  (D.I. 19).  For the following \nreasons, Plaintiffs \u2019 motion for preliminary injunction is GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED -IN-\nPART , Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for permanent injuncti on is DENIED , and Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss  \nis DENIED . \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Federal Firearm Regulation  \nThe signifi cant federal statutes addressing firearms date back almost one hundred years.   \nThe National Firearms Act of 1934 \u201crequired all persons engaged in the business of selling \u2018firearms \u2019 . . . and all firearm owners to register with the Collector of Internal Rev enue, subjected \nall firearm sales to a special tax, and required that they be accompanied by written order forms. The statute made it illegal to move a firearm in interstate commerce without payment of the tax, or to possess a firearm transferred in contra vention of the tax and form requirements .\u201d  United \nStates v. Rybar , 103 F.3d 273, 279 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing Pub.L. No. 474, \u00a7\u00a7 2\u20136, 48 Stat. 1236, \n1237- 38 (superseded by Internal Revenue Code of 1939)).  Four years later, Congress passed the \nFederal Firea rms Act of 1938, which, among other things, made it unlawful \u201cfor any person to \ntransport, ship, or knowingly receive in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d any firearm with a removed, obliterated, or altered serial number, required manufacturers to obtain lic enses before \nengaging in interstate commerce, mandated that licensed dealers keep permanent records of certain 2 information , and barred firearm sales to certain classes of criminals and fugitives.  Pub.L. No. 785, \n52 Stat. 1250- 52 (1938) (repealed 1968).  \nThe next major federal  firearm legislation was the Gun Control Act of 1968, which operates \n(as amended) today .  18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 et. seq.  The Gun Control Act builds  upon the Federal \nFirearms Act by , inter alia , requiring licensed manufacturers and importers of firearms to identify \neach firearm by engraving or casting on the \u201cframe or receiver\u201d  of the \u201cfirearm\u201d a  serial number, \nthe manufacturer\u2019s name, and other identifying information.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(i).  Until \nAugust  24, 2022, \u201cfirearm \u201d and  \u201cfirearm frame  or receiver\u201d were defined as follows:  \n\u201cFirearm\u201d means \u201c[a] ny weapon, including a starter gun, which will \nor is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile \nby the action of an explosive; the frame or receiver of any such weap on; any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or any destructive \ndevice; but the term shall not include an antique firearm.  In the case \nof a licensed collector, the term shall mean only curios and relics.\u201d   \n \n\u201cFirearm frame or receiver\u201d means \u201c[t]hat part of a firearm which \nprovides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to \nreceive the barrel.\u201d   \n \n27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11.  \nAs time passed, these decades -old definitions grew stale.  T raditionally , weapons had a \nsingle frame that housed the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism.  See  Definition \nof \u201cFrame or Receiver\u201d and Identification of Firearms, 86 Fed. Reg. 27720, 27721 (2021)  \n(proposed) .  Certain modern firearms , however,  have replaced the hammer with a striker, which is \nnot included in the above definition.  Id.  Moreover, split -piece and multi- piece receivers , which \ndo not house the hammer, bolt and breechblock in a single frame, have recently become popular .  \nId.  These receiver s do not meet the definition  above  and therefore fall outside of the Gun Control \nAct\u2019s scope.   The result is that entities have been manufacturing and selling kits containing split-3 frame and multi- frame receivers  and the tools necessary to \u201ccomplete the weapon to a functional \nstate with minimal effort, expertise, or equipment\u201d without being subject to the  requirements of \nthe Gun Control Act.  Id. at 27726.  A nd the weapons  produced by these kits are unserialized and \nuntraceable, and no background check is conducted to ensure that purchasers may lawfully possess \na firearm in accordance with federal and state law.1   \nIn April  2022, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms  and Explosives  published a Final \nRule that altered the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d and \u201cfirearm frame or receiver\u201d in an attempt to close the loophole  that allowed unserialized weapons to p roliferate .  Final Rule, Definition of \u201cFrame or \nReceiver\u201d and Identification of Firearms, 87 Fed. Reg. 24,652 (April 26, 2022)  (effective \nAugust  24, 2022) .  Under the Final Rule , unfinished firearm kits that were arguably not subject to \nthe Gun Control Ac t\u2019s mandates with respect to serialization, background checks and record \nkeeping are now subject to those requirements.  The challenged Delaware statutes, described below, were passed prior to the  publication of the  Final Rule . \nB. The Challenged Delaware Laws  \nOn October 20, 2021, the Governor of Delaware signed House Bill 125 (\u201cHB 125\u201d) into \nlaw.  HB 125 amends several statutes  in Delaware\u2019s criminal code.  See An Act To Amend Title \n11 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Firearms, H.B. 125, 151st Gen. Assemb. (De l. 2021) \n(codified at 11 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 222, 1459, 1459A, 1462, 1463).  Specifically, HB 125 criminalizes the \npossession, manufacture, and distribution of unserialized firearms and unfinished firearm components.   \n \n1  The number of unserialized guns appears to be increasing.  Nationwide law enforcement \nrecovered approximately 1,750 of these weapons from crime scenes in 2016.  By 2020, \nthat number had ballooned to almost 9,000.  4 HB 125 creates 11 Del. C. \u00a7  1459A, which proscribes the distribution and possession of  \nunfinished firearm frame s and receivers.2  Section 1459A(a)  makes it a felony to \u201cknowingly \ntransport, ship, transfer or sell\u201d an unfinished firearm frame or receiver unless (1) the person is a \nfederally licensed gun manufacturer or dealer, (2) \u201c[t]he name of the manufacturer and an individual serial number are conspicuously placed on the unfinished firearm frame or receiver in accordance\u201d with federal law, and (3) the person maintains records in accordance with federal law.  Section 1459A (b) makes it unlawful to possess \u201can unfinished firearm frame or receiver that does \nnot have the name of the manufacturer and individual serial number conspicuously placed on it or on a major component of the firearm into which the unfinished firearm frame or receiver will be housed,\u201d unless that person is a federally licensed gun manufacturer who is in the process of manufacturing a firearm frame or receiver.  Section 1459A became effective 90 days after HB 125\u2019s enactment.  See An Act To Amend Title 11 Of The Delaware Code Relating To \nFirearms, H.B. 125 \u00a7 4, 151st Gen. Assemb. (Del. 2021).   \nFurther, HB 125 criminalizes distributing, possessing an d manufacturing untraceable \nfirearms.\n3  See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1463(a) and (b).  Section 1463(a) bars knowingly possessing an \nuntraceable firearm.  Section 1463\u2019s prohibition against distributing or manufacturing untraceable firearms comes  in two forms.  First,  \u00a7 1463(b) criminalizes knowingly manufacturing or \n \n2  11 Del. C. \u00a7 222(35) defines \u201cunfinished firearm frame or receiver\u201d to be \u201ca firearm frame \nor recei ver that requires further machining or molding in order to be used as part of a \nfunctional firearm, and which is designed and intended to be used in the assembly of a \nfunctional firearm.\u201d  \n \n3  11 Del. C. \u00a7 222(37) defines \u201cuntraceable firearm\u201d to mean \u201ca fi rearm for which the sale \nor distribution chain from a licensed retailer to the point of its first retail sale cannot be traced by law -enforcement officials.\u201d  The definition excludes \u201cfirearms manufactured \nprior to 1968, muzzle -loading firearms designed to  use black power  [sic] or its equivalent, \nand firearms which are designed as replicas of antique firearms originally manufactured prior to 1898\u201d from its ambit.  Id.  5 distributing  an untraceable firearm.  Second, \u00a7 1463(c)(1) limits using \u201ca three- dimensional \nprinter[4] or similar device to manufacture or produce a firearm,[5] firearm receiver,[6] or major \nfirearm componen t[7] by a non- licensed manufacturer.\u201d  In addition, \u00a7 1463(c)(2) makes it \nunlawful to \u201c[d]istribute[] by any means, including the internet, to a person who is not licensed as \na manufacturer, instructions in the form of computer -aided design files or other c ode or instructions \nstored and displayed in electronic format as a digital model that may be used to program a three -\ndimensional printer to manufacture or produce a firearm, firearm receiver or major component of a firearm.\u201d  11 Del. C. \u00a7 1463(c)(2).   \nHB 125 also contains regulations  that Plaintiffs do not challenge .  For example, HB  125 \nmakes it a felony to \u201cknowingly transport, ship, possess or receive any firearm or firearm frame or receiver with the knowledge that the importer\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s serial number has been removed, obliterated or altered in a manner that has disguised or concealed the identity or origin of the firearm,\u201d with the exception of firearms manufactured prior to 1973.  11 Del. C. \u00a7 1459.  \n \n4  11 Del. C. \u00a7 222(33) defines \u201cthree -dimensional printer\u201d to be \u201ca computer or computer -\ndriven machine of [sic] device capable of producing a three- dimensional object from a \ndigital model.\u201d  \n \n5  11 Del. C. \u00a7 222(13) defines \u201cfirearm\u201d to include \u201cany weapon from which a shot, \nprojectile or other object may be discharged by force of combustion, explosive, gas and/or mechanical means, whether operable or inoperable, loaded or unloaded.  It does not include \na BB gun.\u201d  \n \n6  11 Del. C. \u00a7 222(14) defines \u201c firearm frame or receiver\u201d to be  \u201cthe part of the firearm that \nprovides housing for the firearm\u2019s internal components, and includes the hammer, bolt or breechblock, action, and firing mechanism.\u201d  \n \n7  11 Del. C. \u00a7 222(19) defines \u201cmajor component of a firearm\u201d  to be \u201cthe slide, barrel, \ncylinder, trigger group, or receiver of a firearm.\u201d  6 Moreover, the bill makes it a felony to possess, manufacture, transport or sell a covert8 or \nundetectable firearm.9  11 Del. C. \u00a7 1462. \nHB 125 also contains a severability provision.  It states that \u201c[i]f any provision of this Act \nor the application of this Act to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the provisions of this \nAct are severable if the invalidity does not affect the other provisions of this Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or the application of this Act that can be given effect without  \nthe invalid application.\u201d  An Act To Amend Title 11 Of The Delaware Code Relating To Firearms, H.B. 125 \u00a7 3, 151st Gen. Assemb. (Del. 2021).  \nC. Present Motions  \nPlaintiff John Rigby is a resident of Delaware who 1) self-manufactured a handgun that he \nremoved out of state due to  fear of criminal sanction , 2) wishes to manufacture firearms with \nfirearm components that he owns, and 3) owns a 3D printer with the desire and intent to use it to \nmanufacture firearms using code that he possesses.  ( See D.I. 7).  But f or HB 125, Plaintiff Rigby \navers that he would still possess his self -manufactured handgun, continue building firearms, and \ndistribute code that may be used  to manufacture firearms on a 3D printer.  ( Id.).   \nPlaintiff Alan Knight is a  Delaware resident who  owns and possesses two unserialized \nunfinished receivers suitable for the manufacture and assembly of an AR -15 design rifle.  \n(See D.I.  8).  Knight asserts that he wishes to use these firearm components to manufacture a \n \n8  11 Del. C. \u00a7222(4) defines \u201ccovert firearm\u201d as  \u201cany firearm that is constructed in a shape \nor configuration such that it does not resemble a firearm. \u201d   \n \n9  11 Del. C. \u00a7222(34) defines \u201cundetectable firearm\u201d to mean  \u201ca firearm constructed entirely \nof nonmetal substances, or a firearm that after removal of all of the major components of a \nfirearm, is not detectable by walk -through metal detectors calibrated and operated to dete ct \nthe security exemplar, or firearm which includes a major component of a firearm, which, if subject to the types of detection devices commonly used at airports for security screening, would not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the component.  It does \nnot include a firearm subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(p)(3) through (6).\u201d  7 firearm for his own use and not to sell or otherwise dispose of it.  Knight  also desires to obtain \nadditional firearm components to manufacture  firearms for his own use .  (Id. \u00b6 7).  \nPlaintiff Firearms Policy Coalition, Inc. is a 501(c)(4) non -profit incorporated under the \nlaws of Delaware with a place of business in Clark County, Nevada.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6 13).  In this litigation, \nFirearms Policy Coalition represents its members \u201cwho include gun owners, prospective gun owners and self -manufacturers, retailers of NFOs, parts, and firearms, and othe rs[.]\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 100).  \nPlaintiffs Rigby and Knight are members of the Firearm Policy Coalition.  (D.I. 7 \u00b6 4, D.I. 8 \u00b6 4).  \nDefendant Kathy Jennings is the Attorney General of Delaware.  (D.I. 1  \u00b6 15). \nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion  for injunctive relief seeks to enjoin Defendant from enforcing 11 Del. \nC. \u00a7\u00a7 1459A, 1463(a), (b), (c)(1) and (c)(2).  Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that \u00a7\u00a7 1459A, 1463(a), \n1463(b) and 1463(c)(1) violate their Second Amendment rights, \u00a7 1463(c)(2) runs afoul of the First Amendment, and \u00a7\u00a7 1459A(b) and 1463(a) constitute  an impermissible taking of private \nproperty under the Fifth Amendment . \nAlso before the Court is Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n10  \n(D.I.  19).  Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs have failed to state a  cognizable claim under the First \nAmendment, Second Amendment , or Fifth Amendment, and seeks dismissal of each  of Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims.    \n  \n \n10  Initially, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint named both Governor  John Carney and Delaware Attorney \nGeneral Kathy  Jennings as defendants .  Defendants sought dism issal of Governor  Carney \nunder Rule 12(b)(1)  and the parties have since  stipulated to dismiss Gov ernor  Carney as a \ndefendant .  (See D.I. 20 at 6\u201310; D.I. 23, 24).  Accordingly, all that remains  of the motion \nto dismiss  is Defendant Jennings\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  8 II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction  \nA motion for preliminary injuncti on requires analyzing  whether:  (1) the moving party has \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) the moving party will suffer irreparable \nharm if an injunction is not granted, (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of the moving party, \nand (4) an injunction is  in the public interest .  See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 20 (2008); see also Osorio- Martinez v. Attorney Gen. United States of Am., 893 F.3d 153, 178 \n(3d Cir. 2018) .  A p reliminary injunction is only appropriate  if the first two fa ctors  are satisfied \nand all  four factors, taken together , weigh in the moving party\u2019s  favor.  See Reilly v. City of \nHarrisburg , 858 F.3d 173, 179 (3d Cir. 2017), as amended (June 26, 2017).  To obtain a permanent \ninjunction, a plaintiff must show actual  success on the merits rather than a likelihood of success \non the merits.  See Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill age of Gambell, Alaska, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12 (1987) \n(\u201cThe standard for a preliminary injun ction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction \nwith the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success.\u201d)  \nB. Motion to Dismiss  \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept all well -pleaded \nfactual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 229 (3d Cir.  2010); see also Phillips v. Cnty. \nof Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 232\u201333 (3d Cir. 2008).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is only \nappropriate if a complaint does not contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plaus ible on its face.\u2019\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , \n578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009).  This plausibility standard obligates a plaintiff to provi de \u201cmore 9 than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d  \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  Instead, the pleadings must provide sufficient factual allegations to \nallow the Court to \u201cdraw the reasonable inference that  the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\u201d  Iqbal , 506 U.S. at 678. \nIII. MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION  \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nIn Plaintiffs mo tion to enjoin Defendant from enforcing 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1459A  and \u00a7 1463(a) , \n(b), (c)(1) and (c)(2), they allege that  their Second Amendment rights are infringed by all of the  \nsubparts of these statutes other than \u00a7 1463(c)(2), which Plaintiffs separately argue transgresses \nthe First Amendment.  The Court addresses the arguments in turn. \n1. Second Amendment Claims  \nIn New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass ociation, Inc. v. Bruen, the Supreme Court set forth \nthe test to be used for analyzing Second Amendment challenges:  \nIn keeping with He ller, we hold that when the Second Amendment \u2019s \nplain text covers an individual \u2019s conduct, the Constitution \npresumptively protects that conduct.  To justify its regulation, the \ngovernment may not simply posit that the regulation promotes an \nimportant intere st.  Rather, the government must demonstrate that \nthe regulation is consistent with this Nation \u2019s historical tradition of \nfirearm regulation.  Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with \nthis Nation \u2019s historical tradition may a court conclude that the \nindividual \u2019s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment \u2019s \nunqualified command.  \n 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2126 (2022) (citations omitted).  Although Bruen  displaced the previous test \nemployed by Courts of Appeals, Bruen  is not altogether new .  Indeed, the Court mus t still ask first  \nwhether the challenged law burdens the Second Amendment.  Id. at 2127; see United States v. \nIngram , No. 0:18- cr-557-MGL -3, 2022 WL 3691350, at *2 (D.S.C. Aug. 25, 2022)  (discussing \nhow Bruen did not displace the previous test\u2019s first step) .  And, i f so, then t he Court must determine 10 whether those statutes are \u201cconsistent with the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d  \nBruen , 142 S. Ct. at 2130.   \nHere, t he challenged statutes prohibit  three types of conduct \u2013 (1) distribution , \n(2) possession , and (3) manufacture of  unfinished firearm frames and receivers and untraceable \nfirearms : \nDistribution .  Sections 1459A(a) and 1463(b) concern the \ndistribution  of unfinished frames or receivers and untraceable \nfirearms , respectively .  Section 1459A(a) makes it unlawful for all \nbut federally licensed gun dealers or manufacturers who maintain \nrecords in accordance with federal law to \u201ctransport, ship, transfer, or sell\u201d unfinished firearm frames or receivers.  Section 1463(b) bars \nthe sale or transfer of an untraceable firearm.    \n Possession .  Sections 1459A(b) and 1463( a) deal with the \npossession of unfinished frames and receivers and  untraceable \nfirearms , respecti vely.  Section 1459A(b)  prohibits  the possession \nof an unfinished frame or receiver that is not serialized and marked in accordance with federal law and \u00a7 1463(a) criminalizes the knowing possession of an untraceable firearm.   \n Manufacture .  Sections 1463( b) and 1463(c)(1)  both prohibit \nmanufacturing an untraceable firearm.  Section 1463(b) bars \nmanufacturing an untraceable firearm and \u00a7 1463(c)(1) prohibits all but licensed manufacturers from using a three -dimensional printer \nto manufacture a firearm, firearm receiver, or major firearm component.    \nThe Court will separately consider each prohibition. \na. The Statutes Concerning the Distribution of Firearms  \n(\u00a7\u00a71459A(a) and 1463(b) )       \nIn District of Columbia v. Heller , the Supreme Court identified a non- exhaustive list of  \n\u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures\u201d that  included \u201claws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d  554 U.S. 570, 625\u201327 (2008).  Such l aws \u201ccomport \nwith the Second Amendment because they affect individuals or conduct unprotected by the right 11 to keep and bear arms.\u201d 11  Binderup v. Att \u2019y Gen. United States of Am., 836 F.3d 336, 343 (3d Cir. \n2016) ( en banc ); see also Drake v. Filko , 724 F.3d 426, 431 (3d Cir. 2013), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111 (2022).  Of course, not every regulation on the com mercial sale \nof arms is presumptively lawful.  In United States v. Marzzarella, the Third Circuit explained that  \n\u201c[i]n order to uphold the constitutionality of a law imposing a condition on the commercial sale of \nfirearms, a court necessarily must examine the nature and extent of the imposed condition.\u201d  \n614 F.3d 85, 91 n.8 (3d Cir. 2010).   \nHere, \u00a7\u00a7 1459A(a) and 1463(b)  permit anyone lawfully able to sell a firearm to do so, and \nsimply require that those  selling or transferring firearms to abide by federal  law when doing so.  \nSection 1459A(a) permits federally licensed gun dealers and manufacturers who abide by federal \nlaw\u2019s serialization and record -keeping requirements to transport, ship, transfer, and sell unfinished \nfirearm frames and receivers.  Thus, P laintiffs will have still have access to these components.  \nFurther, \u00a7 1463(b) bars the sale or transfer  of untraceable firearms but does not prohibit any type \nof firearm to be bought or sold, so long as it is traceable .  Barring the distribution of untraceable \nfirearms may make purchasing a firearm more inconvenient, but this does not amount to a Second \nAme ndment burden because of the easy access to traceable firearms.  See, e.g. , Teixeira v. Cnty. \nof Alameda, 873 F.3d 670, 680 (9th Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201cgun buyers have no right to have \na gun store in a particular location, at least as long as their a ccess is not meaningfully \nconstrained.\u201d) .  Therefore, the Court finds that these regulations impose  conditions on the sale  and \n \n11  Sections 1459(a) and 1463(b)  do not solely target commercial  transactions.  T here is no \nreason to believe , however , that the non- commercial character of a transaction changes the \nanalysis.  See Colorado Outfitters Ass \u2019n v. Hickenlooper , 24 F. Supp. 3d 1050, 1074 \n(D. Colo. 2014) (\u201cLogically, if the government can lawfully regulate the ability of persons \nto obtain firearms from commercial dealers, that same power to regulate should extend to \nnon-commercial transactions.\u201d),  vacated on other grounds and remanded, 823 F.3d 537 \n(10th Cir. 2016).   12 transfer  of firearms that do not burden Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amendment rights  because they do not \nbar the sale of any type of weapon or impose onerous regulations on those wishing to distribute \nunfinished firearm frames and receivers . \nb. The Statutes  Criminalizing Possession  of Firearms   \nIn contrast to the statutes regulating distribution of firearms, the  contested statutes  \nprohibiting the possession of unfinished frames and receivers ( \u00a7 1459A(b) ) and untraceable \nfirearms  (\u00a7 1463(a )) do burden rights protected by the Second Amendment .  T he Second \nAmendment , which protects \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\u201d  protects the \npossession of untraceable firearms and unfinished firearms and receivers  because its text covers \nthe possession of firearms .  Sections  1459A(b) and 1463(a) criminalize the possession of \nunserialized finished firearm frames and untraceable fir earms without providing any way for \nPlaintiffs to keep firearms they lawfully manufactured.12  Thus, the Second Amendment \npresumptively extends to the conduct prohibited by these statutes. \nDefendant asserts that these statutes do not burden conduct protect ed by the Second \nAmendment  because unfinished frames and receivers and untraceable firearms are \u201cnot in common \nuse and typically possessed by law -abiding citizens for lawful purposes .\u201d  (See D.I. 36 at 3; Heller , \n554 U.S. at 625 (2008) ).  Defendant , howeve r, has offered no evidence to support the assertion .  \nIndeed, Defendant \u2019s \u201cevidence \u201d on this point consists of  a single statistic: that law enforcement \nrecovered almost 24,000 untraceable firearms at crime scenes nationwide between 2016 and 2020.  \n(D.I. 11 at 4).  Although this  indicates that untraceable firearms  are at times used by criminals , it \n \n12  California, for example, permits individuals to \u201c[a]pply to the Department of Justice for a \nunique serial number or other mark of identification\u201d for their  firearms.  Cal. Penal Code \n\u00a7 29180 (b)(1).  Unlike California, Delaware is criminalizing the possession of once -\nlawfully possessed firearms without giving Plaintiffs any opportunity to maintain possession of their firearms by applying for a serial number.   13 ignores that firearms unquestionably protected by the Second Amendment are also sometimes used \nby criminals.  What is important is whether the prohibited untraceable firearms and unfinished \nfirearm components are \u201cnot typically possessed by law -abiding citizens for law ful purposes.\u201d  On \nthe record currently before the Court, Defendant  has failed to provide  evidence t hat persuades the \nCourt that this standard has been met .13  Therefore, the Court finds that these statutes burden rights \nprotected by the Second Amendment. \n \n13  Defendant suggest s that it is Plaintiff s\u2019 burden to prove that the Second Amendment \nprotects the right to possess untraceable firearms and unfinished firearm frames and \nreceiver s.  ( See D.I. 36 at 3 (\u201cPlaintiffs allege no facts demonstrating that self -\nmanufactured or self -assembled, unserialized and untraceable guns are in \u2018common use\u2019 \nand typically owned for lawful purposes today\u201d), at 4 (\u201cPlaintiffs do not explain why a \nlaw-abiding citizen would prefer an unserialized and untraceable firearm, nor do they \nprovide any lawful purpose for possessing unserialized and untraceable firearms, when serialized and traceable firearms have long been the norm and are widely available.\u201d) ).  It \nis, however, Defendant\u2019s  burden to prove that the challenged regulation does not implicate \nthe Second Amendment.  See New York State Rifle and Pistol Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Cuomo, 804 \nF.3d 242, 257 n.73 (2d Cir. 2015)  (explaining that Heller  \u201cidentifies a presump tion in favor \nof Second Amendment protection, which the State bears the initial burden of rebutting\u201d); Ezell v. City of Chicago , 651 F.3d 684, 702- 03 (7th Cir. 2011) (\u201c[I]f the government can \nestablish that a challenged law regulates activity falling outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as it was understood at the relevant historical moment \u2013  1791 or 1868  \u2013 \nthen the analysis can stop there; the regulated activity is categorically unprotected, and the law is not subject to further Second Amendment review.\u201d); Tyler v. Hillsdale Cnty. Sheriff \u2019s Dept. , 837 F.3d 678, 685- 86 (6th Cir. 2016) (placing burden on government to \ndemonstrate that the law regulates conduct outside the scope of the second amendment) .  \nThat burden does not flip simply because th e context of the inquiry is a motion for \npreliminary injunction.  See Miller v. Bonta , 542 F. Supp. 3d 1009, 1029 (S.D. Cal. 2021) \n(\u201cPlaintiffs do not have to shoulder the burden of proving that they are entitled to enjoy \nSecond Amendment rights.  The command of the Amendment is that the right to keep and \nbear arms \u2018 shall not be infringed.\u2019   It follows that when a citizen complains in a facial \nchallenge that the government is infringing, then it is the government that must carry the burden of justif ying its restriction of Second Amendment rights. . . . The correct starting \norientation is that no arm may be prohibited.  If a plaintiff challenges the government \u2019s \nprohibition, it is on the government first to prove the banned arm is dangerous and unusual, and if not that it is not commonly possessed, or not commonly possessed by law -abiding \ncitizens, or not commonly possessed for lawful purposes or militia readiness.\u201d) , vacated \non other grounds , No. 21- 22608, 2022 WL 3095986 (9 th Cir. August 1, 2022). 14 Turning to the second step in the Bruen  analysis, the Court finds that Defendant has not \ndemonstrated that \u00a7 1459A(b) and \u00a7 1463(a) are \u201cconsistent with the Nation\u2019s historical tradition \nof firearm regulation.\u201d  Bruen , 142 S. Ct. at 2130.  Defendant argues  that \u201c[ l]aws tracking and \nrestricting the possession of firearms date back to colonial times\u201d and that \u201c[s]erialization dates to \nthe same time period as Heller \u2019s examples and should also be considered a longstanding and \npresumptively valid measure,\u201d but D efendant has not identified a single  statute or regulation to \nsubstantiate her  argument.  (D.I. 11 at 8; see also D.I. 36).  \u201cCourts are [] entitled to decide a case \nbased on the historical record compiled by the parties\u201d and  Defendant has furnished nothin g to \njustify this law as longstanding except for attorney argument .  Bruen , 142 S. Ct. at 2130  n.6.14  \nAttorney argument is not evidence.  Scott v. DST Sys., Inc., No. 1:18- cv-286-RGA, 2019 WL \n3997097, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 23, 2019); CryoLife, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc. , No. 14- cv-559-SLR, \n2015 WL 1093543, at *3 (D. Del. Mar. 10, 2015).  Indeed, the absence of historical evidence in \nDefendant\u2019s briefing stands in stark contrast to that of  other parties who have defended firearm \nregulations under  Bruen \u2019s framework .  See, e.g. , Defendant\u2019s Supplemental Briefing, Nat \u2019l Ass \u2019n \nfor Gun Rts., Inc. v. City of San Jose , No. 22- cv-501-BLF (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2022), ECF No. 64.  \nWith no evidence of longstanding analogous  firearm regulations in the record, the Court cannot \nconclude that \u00a7 1459A(b) and \u00a7 1463(a) are \u201c consistent with the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of \nfirearm regulation.\u201d  \nThus, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that \u00a7 1459A(b) \nand \u00a7 1463 violate their Second Amendment rights.  These statutes burden constitutionally \n \n14  \u201cThe job of judges is not to resolve historical questions in the abstract; it is to resolve legal \nquestions presented in particular cases or controversies.  That \u201clegal inquiry is a refined \nsubset\u201d of a broader \u201chistorical inquiry,\u201d and it relies on \u201cvarious e videntiary principles \nand default rules\u201d to resolve uncertainties.  Bruen , 142 S. Ct. at 2130 n.6 ( quoting W. Baude \n& S. Sachs, Originalism and the Law of the Past, 37 L. & Hist. Rev. 809, 810\u2013811 (2019) ). 15 protected conduct because possession of firearms and firearm frames and receivers is within the \nscope of the Second Amendment\u2019s right to \u201ckeep and bear Arms\u201d and Defendant has not shown \nthat these firearms  and components are not commonly owned by law -abiding citizens for lawful \npurposes.  Further, Defendant has offered no evidence that these statutes are consistent with the nation\u2019s history of firearm regulation.   \nc. The Statutes Prohibiting Manufacturing of Firearms  \nPlaintiffs  also contend that those portions of \u00a7 1463(b) and \u00a7 1463(c)(1) that  prohibit \nmanufacturing untraceable firearms are  unconstitutional.  Defendant again asserts that this \nregulation concerns  conduct that is not protected by the Second Amendment .  The Court disagrees.  \nIn Ezell v. City of Chicago , the Seventh Circuit struck down a Chicago ordinance that \nsimultaneously (1) permitted only thos e who have trained at a firing -range to possess firearm s and \n(2) barred firing -ranges within city limits.  The Seventh Circuit reasoned that \u201c[t]he right to possess \nfirearms for protection implies a corresponding right to acquire and maintain proficiency i n their \nuse; the core right wouldn\u2019t mean much without the training and practice that make it effective.\u201d  651 F.3d 684, 704 (7th Cir. 2011).  Similarly, here, the right to keep and bear arms implies a \ncorresponding right to manufacture arms .  Indeed, t he right to keep and bear arms would be \nmeaningless  if no individual or entity could manufacture a firearm.  Thus, if possessing untraceable \nfirearms is protected by the Second Amendment, then so too is manufacturing them . \nProceeding to Bruen \u2019s historical inq uiry, Defendant  once again resorts to conclusory \nargument and has furnished no evidence that the laws in question are in line with the nation\u2019s \nhistorical tradition of firearms regulation.  It is Defendant\u2019s burden to justify a Second Amendment \nburden as l ongstanding and Defendant has not put forth any evidence to meet her burden.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff s have demonstrated  a likelihood of success that those 16 portions of \u00a7 1463(b) and \u00a7 1463(c)(1) that prohibit manufacturing untraceable f irearms are \nunconstitutional.  \n2. First Amendment Claims  \nPlaintiffs  challenge \u00a7 1463(c)(2), which prohibits \u201cdistribut[ing] by any means, including \nthe internet, to a person who is not licensed as a manufacturer, instructions in the form of computer -\naided design files or other code or instructions stored and displayed in electronic format as a digital \nmodel that may be used to program a three -dimensional printer to manufacture or produce a \nfirearm, firearm receiver, or major component of a fi rearm ,\u201d on multiple First Amendment \ngrounds.  First, Plaintiffs allege that the  statute is an unjustifiable  content -based speech regulation.  \n(D.I. 6 at 13\u201315).  Second, Plaintiffs contend that the law  is overbroad.  ( Id. at 15\u201316).  Finally, \nPlaintiffs claim that the statute amounts to an impermissible prior restraint on speech.  ( Id. at 17).  \nThe Court addresses these challenges  in turn.15 \n \n15  The Court must consider these challenges if  \u00a7 1463(c)(2) burdens  constitutionally protected \nspeech .  Defendant argues that the statute does not target speech as it concerns only \n\u201cblueprints that can be used with a three -dimensional printer to automatically generate \nfirearms and firearms components.\u201d  (D.I . 11 at 13\u201314).  Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe process \nof assembling or self -manufacturing a firearm involves various levels of individual choice \nand customization, and application of individual skill, and is thus expressive\u201d and that the \nban \u201cpunishes the idea to be communicated or conveyed \u2013 information relating to the \ncreation of a firearm[.]\u201d  (D.I. 16 at 9).  \n  As between the parties, Defendant\u2019s characterization is closer to the mark.  Section 1463(c)(2) does not prohibit discussing how to manufacture  a firearm or providing \ninstructions of how to do the same.  Rather, the statute prohibits distributing to non- licensed \nmanufacturers computer files and code that \u201cmay be used to program a three -dimensional \nprinter to manufacture or produce a firearm, fire arm receiver, or major component of a \nfirearm.\u201d  The \u201cmay be used to program\u201d clause restricts \u00a7 1463(c)(2)\u2019s scope to functional computer files or code.  \n  The Court is skeptical that \u00a7 1463(c)(2) implicates the First Amendment.  Code that is functional will \u201cinduce action without the intercession of the mind or the will of the recipient.\u201d  Commodity Futures Trading Comm \u2019n v. Vartuli , 228 F.3d 94, 111 (2d Cir . \n2000).  When the action to be induced, in this case the manufacturing of a firearm, is unrelated to the First Amendment, it makes little sense that the First Amendment would be 17 a. Whether the Statute is a Content -Based  Regulation  \nTo determine the appropriate level of scrutiny, the Court must dete rmine whether \n\u00a7 1463(c)(2) is a content  based or content  neutral regulation.  See Bruni v. City of Pittsburgh, \n941 F.3d 73, 83 (3d Cir. 2019).  Content based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny and content \nneutral regulations are subject to interme diate scrutiny.  See id. at 83 \u201384.  \u201cA regulation of speech \nis facially content based under the First Amendment if it \u2018target[s] speech based on its communicative content\u2019 \u2014that is, if it \u2018applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed \nor the i dea or message expressed.\u2019 \u201d  City of Austin v. Reagan Nat \u2019l Advert. of Austin, LLC , 142 S. \nCt. 1464, 1471 (2022) (quoting Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015)).  A regulation \nmay also be content  based if it cannot be \u201cjustified without referen ce to the content of the regulated \nspeech\u201d or was  adopted \u201cbecause of disagreement with the message [the speech] conveys.\u201d  Ward \nv. Rock Against Racism , 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).  If a law does not have a content  based purpose \nor justification, the law is content neutral.  City of Austin , 142 S. Ct. at 1471. \n\u201cFirst Amendment precedents and doctrines have consistently recognized that restrictions \non speech may require some evaluation of the speech and nonetheless re main content neutral ,\u201d so \nit is of no consequence that \u00a7 1463(c)(2) requires analysis of whether the code is functional  and \nwhat the code\u2019s function is .  City of Austin , 142 S. Ct. at 1473.  For example, in Defense Distributed \nv. United States Department of  State , a regulation restricting the export of defense articles was \nfound to be content  neutral because it \u201cdoes not regulate disclosure of technical data based on the \n \nimplicated  by regulations concerning that action.  Imagine, for example, a lo cal regulation \nmandating that self -driving vehicles be programmed so  that they drive no faster than 25 \nmiles per hour in school zones  during certain hours .  Would such a regulation compel \nspeech?  The Court suspects not, given that the aim of the regulation would be to promote \npublic safety rather than compelling anything expressive.  Nevertheless, the Court need not decide this issue on the preliminary record before it because Defendant prevails even assuming \u00a7 1463(c)(2) burdens protected speech.  18 message it is communicating[,]\u201d but was instead imposed \u201cto satisfy a number of foreign policy \nand national defense goals[.]\u201d  121 F. Supp. 3d 680, 694 (W.D. Tex. 2015) , aff\u2019d sub nom. Def. \nDistributed v. United States Dep \u2019t of State , 838 F.3d 451 (5th Cir. 2016).  Similarly, courts have  \nfound that an anti -trafficking provision of the Digita l Millennium Copyright Act that bar s \ndistributing code used to circumvent anti-piracy  measures to be content  neutral because the statute \nhas \u201cnothing to do with suppressing particular ideas of computer programmers . . . [r]ather, it is \nfocused squarely upon the effect of the distribution of the functional capability that the code provides.\u201d  Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes , 111 F. Supp. 2d 294, 329 (S.D.N.Y.), aff \u2019d \nsub nom. Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley , 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001).  Lik e the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act, \u00a7 1463(c)(2) is not concerned with stifling expression of any idea.  It \nis concerned with controlling the distribution of untraceable firearms.  Section 1463(c)(2) focuse s \non whether the code \u201cmay be used to program a three -dimensional printer to manufacture or \nproduce a firearm, firearm receiver or major component of a firearm,\u201d not whether the code \nexpresses any particular idea.  Indeed, the regulation does not prohibit discussing how to use a 3D -\nprinter to build a firearm or conveying information that would aid someone in doing so.  Rather, the regulation prohibits distributing code that could itself function to build a firearm.  The Court \nwill therefore subject \u00a7  1463(c)(2) to intermediate scrutiny. \nA law passes muster under intermediate scrutiny if it \u201c(1) advances a \u2018substantial\u2019 \ngovernmental interest; (2) does not \u2018burden substantially more speech than is necessary\u2019 (i.e., the statute must be narrowly tailored); and (3) leaves open \u2018ample alternati ve channels for \ncommunication.\u2019\u201d  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Att \u2019y Gen. of U.S., 677 F.3d 519, 535 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Ward , 491 U.S. at 798\u2013800).  \u201cA statute may satisfy intermediate scrutiny even though it \nis not the \u2018least restrictive or least intru sive\u2019 means of furthering the government \u2019s substantial 19 interest.\u201d  Id.  (quoting Ward , 491 U.S. at 798).  It is evident that \u00a7  1463(c)(2) advances a substantial \ngovernment interest, as distributing a mechanism for automatically manufacturing untraceable \nfirearms to non- licensed manufactures implicates public safety.  See Defense Distributed, 121. F. \nSupp. 3d at 694\u201395 (finding that the government has a substantial interest in regulating the dissemination of military information, including blueprints to manuf acture 3D -printed firearms);  \nsee also Universal City Studios , 111 F. Supp. 2d at 330 (finding that  \u201c[t]he anti -trafficking \nprovision of the DMCA furthers an important governmental interest  \u2013 the protection of \ncopyrighted works stored on digital media from the vastly expanded risk of piracy in this electronic age.\u201d) .  Moreover, the statute does not burden substantially more speech than is necessary.  The \nstatute prohibits only the distribution of functional code.  It does not prohibit gunsmiths and hobbyists  from exchanging information about how to use their 3D -printer to manufacture a \nfirearm, or for instructing individuals on how to program their 3D -printer to make the firearm of \ntheir choice.  The statute is concerned with the distribution of functional code that can build a \nfirearm, firearm receiver, or major firearm component \u2013 a concern that aligns with the \ngovernment\u2019s substantial interest in restricting the distribution of untraceable firearms.  Given the \nnarrow scope of the statute, the Court finds that it leaves ample alternative channels to communicate about how to use a 3D -printer to manufacture a firearm, firearm receiver, or major \nfirearm component.  Accordingly, the Court finds that \u00a7 1463(c)(2) is a valid, content  neutral \nregulation of speech.  \nb. Whether t he Statute is Overbroad  \nThe Court also finds that \u00a7 1463(c)(2) is not overbroad.  \u201cAccording to [] First Amendment \noverbreadth doctrine, a statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.\u201d  U.S. v. Williams , 553 U.S. 285, 298 (2008).  A litiga nt challenging a statute as overbroad \nwill succeed if the \u201cstatute\u2019s overbreadth [is] substantial , not only in an absolute sense, but also 20 relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d  Id.   As explained above, this statute is narrowly \nfocused on di stributing functional code.  It does not prohibit discussing how to use a 3D -printer to \nmanufacture firearms or instructing someone on how to create the code to do so.  The statute only \nprohibits distributing code which \u201cmay be used to program\u201d a 3D -printe r to manufacture a firearm, \nfirearm receiver, or major component of a firearm.   Thus, the  Court does not find that this statute  \nto be  overbroad.  \nc. Whether t he Statute is a Prior Restraint on Speech  \n\u201cThe term prior restraint is used \u2018to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding \ncertain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.\u2019\u201d   Alexander v. United States , 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) (quoting M. Nimmer, Nimmer on \nFreedom of Speech \u00a7 4.03, pp. 4- 14 (1984 )).  A prior restraint censors speech prior to its \ndissemination  rather than impos ing punishment after the speech has been communicated.  See id. \nat 553- 54 (explaining that the First Amendment juris prudence has \u201csteadfastly preserved the \ndistinction between prior restraints and subsequent punishments\u201d stemming from English common law).  In this case, \u00a7  1463(c)(2) is not a prior restraint scheme because it operates by imposing \npunishment after the pur ported speech  has occurred. \nB. Irreparable Harm  \n\u201c[T]o show irreparable harm a plaintiff must demonstrate potential harm which cannot be \nredressed by a legal or an equitable remedy following a trial.\u201d  Acierno v. New Castle County , \n40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \u201cWhen an alleged \ndeprivation of a constitutional right is involved . . . most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.\u201d  11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Ka y Kane ,\n \nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE  \u00a7 2948.1 ( 3d ed.  2022) ; see also Bullock v. Carney , No. 20 -\n2096, 2020 WL 7038527, at *3 (3d Cir. June 4, 2020) (Phipps dissenting) (citing Wright and Miller 21 \u00a7 2948.1) .  Here, Plaintiffs face irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction because they are \nthreatened by criminal penalties should they engage in conduct protected by the Second \nAmendment.16  This element therefore weighs in favor of granting injunctive relie f. \nC. Remaining Factors: Public Interest and Balance of Hardships  \nThe remaining two factors, on balance, also tip in favor of granting preliminary injunctive \nrelief.  The public interest favors Plaintiffs as the \u201cenforcement of an unconstitutional law \nvindica tes no public interest.\u201d  K.A. ex rel. Ayers v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist., 710 F.3d 99, 114 \n(3d Cir. 2013) (citing ACLU v. Ashcroft , 322 F.3d 240, 251 n.11 (3d Cir. 2003) (\u201c[N]either the \nGovernment nor the public generally can claim an interest in the enf orcement of an \nunconstitutional law.\u201d )).  As to the balance of hardships , Plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that \nthey are suffering a deprivation of their constitutionally protected rights  and Defendant \u2019s argument \nthat an injunction would constrain  the state\u2019s ability to address the proliferation of unserialized, \nuntraceable firearms that are being  used for nefarious purposes  is somewhat compelling .17  Thus, \nthis factor is largely neutral.  \nD. Only Preliminary Relief is Appropriate  \nAs discussed, the four factors, considered as a whole, dictate granting preliminary relief , \nenjoining enforcement of \u00a7\u00a7 1459A(b) , 1463(a) and 1463(c)(1) as well as the portions of \u00a7 1463(b) \nthat prohibit manufacturing or assembling untraceable firearms .  See Reilly v. City of Harrisburg , \n858 F.3d 173, 179 (3d Cir. 2017), as amended (June 26, 2017).  The Court , however, denies \nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion for permanent injunctive reli ef.  The issues at stake are of significant public \nimportance and the Court will not conclusively decide them now on a preliminary record.  The \n \n16  As discussed above, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits on \nthe record presently before the Court.  \n \n17  The Court is not enjoining enforcement of laws that constrain the distribution of firearms.  22 parties will, therefore, have the opportunity to further develop the record should they wish to do \nso. \nIV. MOTION TO DISMISS  \nAs explained above, Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their \nSecond Amendment claim.  Although Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their First Amendment claim, it is a well- pleaded claim and not fit for dismissal.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint also includes  a well -pleaded Takings Claim.\n18  Plaintiffs have stated a prima \nfacie  Takings Claim because they allege that the challenged laws required them to dispossess \nthemselves of  the proscribed firearms and unfinished frames and receivers.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 80- 81, 92-\n95, 105- 06).  Defendant argues that this does not state a  Takings  Claim because \u201c[a] government \ndoes not need to compensate owners when it prohibits a type of personal property through a valid law.\u201d  (D.I. 20 at 15).  This argument fails, however, because Defendant has not demonstrated that \nthe laws requiring dispossession of Plaintiffs\u2019 property are valid.  Therefore, Defendant\u2019s motion \nto dismiss will b e denied in its entirety.  \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is GRA NTED -IN-\nPART and DENIED -IN-PART, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a permanent injunction is DENIED, and \nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.   An appropriate order will be entered.  \n \n18  Because the Court is granting preliminary relief on Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amendment claim, \nanalyzing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for injunctive relief did not require analysis of the Takings Claim.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nJOHN RIGBY, ALAN KNIGHT, and \nFIREARMS POLICY COALITION, INC.,  \n \n   Plaintiffs,  \n \n v. \n KATHY JENNINGS, Attorney General of \nDelaware,  \n \n   Defendant.  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n)  \n \n   C.A.
