No. 22-86- MN-JLH \n      \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOM MENDATION  \nPlaintiff Noah Alexander Gaspero  appeals from an unfavorable decision of the \nCommissioner of the Social Security Administration denying his applications for child disability \ninsurance benefits and supplemental security income.  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).  \nThe p arties filed cross- motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 16, 19.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on November 15, 2022, Plaintiff \u2019s motion  should be D ENIED and \nDefendant\u2019 s cross-motion should be GRANTED. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissio ner\u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence. \u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence \u201c means \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d   Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).  In reviewing \nwhether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts may not \u201c re-weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d   Chandler v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d 2 \n 356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011); see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014).  In other \nwords, reviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner\u2019 s decision, even if the y would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u2009404.1520(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v);  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third \nCircuit has previously explai ned this sequential analysis, and the shifting burdens that attend each \nstep, in detail:  \nThe first two steps involve threshold determinations.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful a ctivity.  If a claimant is \nfound to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If th e claimant does not have a severe \nimpairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissioner compares the medical evidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to precl ude any gainful work.  If the \nimpairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether \nthe claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work.  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant doe s \nnot meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to \ndeny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairme nts, age, education, past work experience, and residual \nfunctional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n 3 \n Newell v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc . Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545\u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks disability insurance benefits or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm\u2019 r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench on November 15, 2022, \nas follows:  \nFor the reasons I am about to summarize, Plaintiff\u2019 s motion \nfor summary judgment should be denied  and the Commissioner \u2019s \ncross- motion for summary judgment should be granted.  \n  \nPlaintiff assigns numerous errors to several steps of the \nALJ\u2019s analysis. Plaintiff also contends that the appointment of the \nALJ who heard his case was constitutionally defective.  \n \nPlaintiff first contends that the ALJ erred at step three.  At \nstep three, the ALJ compared the medical evidence of [Plaintiff]\u2019 s \nimpairments to a list of impairments presumed severe enough to find an individual per se disabled.  Plaintiff argues that the ALJ \ndid not compare his ulcerative colitis and joint hypermobility \nsyndrome to the correct listings.  I disagree.  Ulcerative colitis i s \nspecifically mentioned in Listing 5.06,\n0F1 and the ALJ evaluated \nPlaintiff\u2019 s impairments against that listing . 1F2  The ALJ also \nproperly compared Plaintiff\u2019 s joint hypermobility syndrome to \nListing 1.18, an umbrella category for abnormalities of major \njoints. 2F3  Plaintiff has not cited to this Court any listing that Plaintiff \nbelieves is more appropriate.   \n \nPlaintiff contends that the ALJ should have considered his \nheadaches according to SSR 19- 4P and paragraph B of Listing \n11.02.  He admits, however, that  his headaches are a side effect of \nhis medicine, and he therefore does not have a primary headache \ndisorder. 3F4  Since [he] does not have a primary headache disorder, \n \n1 20 C.F.R., Pt. 404, Subpt. P., App. 1, Section 5.00(E)(1).  \n \n2 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 12 (\u201cRecord\u201d or \u201cR.\u201d), at 18.)  \n \n3 (R. 18); 20 C.F.R., Pt. 404, Subpt. P., App. 1, Section 1.00(I)(1).  \n \n4 (D.I. 17 at 6.)  \n 4 \n the ALJ did not need to assess symptoms of his headaches against \nListing 11.02. 4F5  Nor ha s plaintiff explained how the evidence of \nhis headaches equals that listing.  \n \nPlaintiff also argues that the ALJ erred in determining his \nRFC.   The Court has carefully reviewed the pertinent portions of \nthe record on this issue.  Having done so, the Court understands and has considered Plaintiff \u2019s arguments regarding the ALJ \u2019s \ndecision not to include additional limitations in the RFC.  But it is not the role of this Court to second -guess the ALJ\u2019 s fact finding.  \nEven if this Court might have come to a diffe rent conclusion on \nthe same evidence, there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Plaintiff\u2019 s RFC.   \n The ALJ found that Plaintiff has severe medically \ndeterminable impairments of ulcerative colitis, AMPS, and hypermobility that could reasonably cause the symptoms he alleges.  However, the ALJ found that Plaintiff \u2019s testimony \nconcerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of his symptoms were not consistent with the medical evidence of record.\n5F6  From there, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff could \nperform light work with the only limitations being that he could never climb ladders, ropes, and scaffolds and only occasionally tolerate exposure to vibration .\n6F7  \n \nAs an initial matter, I reject Plaintiff \u2019s argument that the \nALJ committed legal error by not explaining the basis for his findings in a way that would permit meaningful judicial review.  \n \n5 See SSR 19 -4P, 84 Fed. Reg. 44667 (Aug. 26, 2019)  (\u201cWe may establish only a primary \nheadache disorder as an [medically determinable impairment]. We will not establish secondary headaches (for example, headache attributed to trauma or injury to the head or neck or to infection) as MDIs because secondary headaches are symptoms of another underlying medical condition. \u201d); \nsee also  Lawrence W. v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., No. 21- 18959, 2022 WL 16555246, at *4 (D.N.J. \nOct. 31, 2022) ( citing  SSR 19 -4P); Tollon v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., No. 21- 1507, 2022 WL \n2610518, at *13 (N.D. Ohio May 3, 2022), report and recommendation adopted , 2022 WL \n2286214 (N.D. Ohio June 24, 2022) ( \u201c[T]he unde rsigned finds that Tollon has not identified \nevidence showing that her headache is a \u2018 primary headache disorder \u2019 such that the ALJ was \nrequired to consider Listing 11.02.\u201d ). \n \n6 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529(a) ( \u201cIn determining whether you are disabled, we consider all \nyour symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which your symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence. \u201d), \u00a7\u2009416.929(a) \n(same).  \n \n7 (R. 18.)  \n 5 \n Contrary to Plaintiff \u2019s suggestion, the law does not impose a \nminimum page requirement, and the ALJ \u2019s opinion adequately \nsummarizes the evidence he considered and explains the basis for \nhis findings.  \n \nPlaintiff next argues that the ALJ \u2019s RFC failed to take into \naccount the frequency of his bi -monthly ( i.e., every two months) \nRemicade injections, which Plaintiff suggests would require him to miss work.  But even if medical appointments were required to be taken into account with  fashioning an RFC (and the \nCommissioner contends they are not), nothing in the record indicates that Plaintiff would be required to schedule his Remicad e \nappointments during working hours so that they would interfere with his ability to obtain work.\n7F8   \n [Plaintiff]  argues the ALJ needed to include limitations in \nthe RFC to account for the side -effects he experiences from the \nRemicade treatments, including fatigue and headaches.   The Third Circuit has observed that side effects such as \u201c drowsiness often \naccompanies the taking of medication, \u201d and \u201cshould not be viewed \nas disabling unless the record references serious functional limitations \u201d related to them.\n8F9  Here the record lacks reference to \nany serious functional limitation related to his reported Remicade side ef fects.  Given that, the ALJ did not commit legal error by \nforegoing side effect -related limitations in the RFC, particularly \nsince the same records the ALJ clearly considered reflect that the side effects were minor and/or dissipated quickly .\n9F10 \n \n8 See Cherkaoui v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 678 F. App\u2019 x 902, 904 (11th Cir. 2017) \n(\u201c[N]othing in the record indicates that Cherkaoui was required, or would be required, to schedule \nher medical appointments during working hours so that they would interfere with her  ability to \nobtain work. \u201d); Stull v. Saul , No. 19-227, 2020 WL 5774895, at *1 n.1 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2020) \n(\u201cMoreover, while the record undoubtedly shows that Plaintiff has attended a number of \nappointments over the years, there is no indication in the re cord that each appointment requires \nher to miss a full day of work. Additionally, since the record does not show that such appointments could not be scheduled outside of Plaintiff \u2019s prospective working hours, there is also no indication \nthat Plaintiff would necessarily have to miss partial days of work in order to attend her appointments.\u201d ). \n \n9 Rutherford v. Barnhart , 399 F.3d 546, 555 (3d Cir. 2005) (quoting Burns v. Barnhart , \n312 F.3d 113, 131 (3d Cir. 2002)).  \n \n10 (See, e.g., R. 19\u201321 (citing 3F  (R. 623)  (Telephone encounter: \u201c Noah has been feeling \ndizzy since remicade. It initially went away and came back  . . . [ He] has had no headaches. \u201d))); \nsee also  R. 928 ( \u201cReports fatigue after infusions, and notes blue tinted vision for a few minutes \nafter the start of the infusion, then it resolves. \u201d).) 6 \n  \nPlaintiff next argues that the RFC finding failed to take \ninto account Plaintiff \u2019s need for unscheduled bathroom breaks to \naddress the cyclical and unpredictable nature of flares and diarrhea \nresulting from his ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel diseas e.  \nHowever, it is clear from the ALJ \u2019s opinion that he was aware of \nand took into consideration the evidence of Plaintiff \u2019s reported \ndiarrhea during the relevant period. 10F11  In particular, the ALJ \nrecognized that at the beginning of the relevant period, Pl aintiff \nhad c. diff infections (which caused diarrhea) but that he had not had another such infection since July 2017.  Plaintiff again reported ongoing diarrhea in 2019 and it was later recommended that he start taking Remicade, which improved his symptom s.  The \nALJ also recognized that Plaintiff had a (reportedly weeks -long) \nperiod of frequent diarrhea later in December 2020, but that his symptoms improved with medication and that Plaintiff subsequently returned to having normal bowel movements.   \n Plaint iff\u2019s real point appears to be that his ulcerative colitis \nimpairment will cause him to again to be stricken with a lengthy period of serious diarrhea in the future and that the ALJ \u2019s RFC \nfailed to take into account the fact that he would need long, unsche duled bathroom breaks when that occurred.  But the ALJ \nwas entitled to agree with the state agency doctors who were aware of Plaintiff\u2019 s ulcerative colitis and did not recommend an \nadditional limitation to account for future anticipated diarrhea.  And, contrary to Plaintiff\u2019 s suggestion, there is no requirement \nthat an ALJ must, as a matter of law, include \u201c unscheduled breaks \nto use the rest room\u201d\n11F12 in the RFC whenever a claimant has severe \nulcerative colitis.   \n \nPlaintiff next contends that the ALJ erred b y not including \nin the RFC scheduled days off, limitations for time off  task, and \nmore restrictive walking and standing limitations necessitated by Plaintiff\u2019 s pain and fatigue from his joint hypermobility syndrome \nand AMPS.  But the ALJ was entitled to conclude, as he did, that Plaintiff\u2019 s statements regarding the severity of his pain and fatigue \nsymptoms were not entirely consistent with the other evidence of record.  There is no requirement that a claimant experience no pain in order to be found not disa bled.  The ALJ was entitled to rely on \nthe opinions of the state medical examiners, who concluded that, notwithstanding Plaintiff\u2019 s hypermobility and AMPS, Plaintiff \n \n11 (R. 20.)  \n \n12 (D.I. 17 at 9.)  \n 7 \n could perform light work with additional limitations.  The ALJ \nalso pointed out, among other things, that Plaintiff reported to a physician in March 2021 that he had tapered himself off his rheumatologist- prescribed medication and that his pain was \nadequately controlled.\n12F13 \n \nPlaintiff argues that the ALJ should have included an off -\ntask limitati on due to Plaintiff \u2019s depression.  As discussed below, \nhowever, Plaintiff did not raise the issue of his depression inhibiting his ability to perform work related tasks, and his brief to this Court does not point to evidence in the record that would sugges t that an off -task limitation due to his depression is even \nappropriate.  The ALJ \u2019s opinion reflects that he expressly \nconsidered and took into account Plaintiff \u2019s father \u2019s testimony that \nPlaintiff has memory problems; the ALJ noted that Plaintiff\u2019 s \nobject ive exams showed no cognitive deficits.\n13F14 \n Plaintiff next argues that he \u201c was prejudiced by his lack of \ncounsel \u201d in the proceedings before the ALJ.\n14F15  I take Plaintiff to \nbe arguing, in part, that the ALJ failed to adequately develop the administrative record.\n15F16  I disagree.  Plaintiff contends that the \nALJ should have requested medical records from Dr. Ufberg, but the record reflects that Dr. Ufberg merely prescribed Plaintiff medication by phone one time when Plaintiff \u2019s treating \ngastroenterologist was out of the office.  Nor does Plaintiff explain \nhow the ALJ \u2019s failure to request records from Dr. Ufberg was \nanything other than harmless, especially si nce there is no \nindication that Dr. Ufberg possessed any records that weren\u2019 t \nalready before the ALJ.   \n \nPlaintiff contends that the ALJ could have obtained a \n\u201ctreating source opinion\u201d  from one of Plaintiff \u2019s treating \nphysicians, but Plaintiff again fails t o explain how this might have \nchanged the ALJ \u2019s decision.  Putting aside Dr. Ufberg, the ALJ \nhad no reason to believe that the administrative record was missing any pertinent medical records from any  of Plaintiff\u2019 s \n \n13 (R. 21.)   \n \n14 (R. 20.)  \n \n15 (D.I. 17 at 10.)  \n \n16 See Reefer v. Barnhart , 326 F.3d 376, 380 (3d Cir. 2003) ( \u201cAn ALJ owes a duty to a pro \nse claimant to help him or her develop the administrative record \u201d); see also 20 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 404.1545(a)(3).  \n 8 \n numerous treating physicians. 16F17  The ALJ also had before him the \nreports of state agency medical consultants who had reviewed the \nmedical records of Plaintiff\u2019 s treating physicians and opined on \nPlaintiff\u2019 s limitations.   \n Plaintiff suggest ed to this Court that the ALJ should have \nordered a psychological consultative examination.  But, again, Plaintiff did not allege disability based on psychological \nlimitations in his benefit applications, nor did the records before \nthe ALJ indicate that ment al illness or psychological issues were \npreventing Plaintiff from performing work functions.   I likewise \nreject Plaintiff \u2019s argument that the ALJ committed legal error by \nnot requesting a consultative examination to explore the limiting \neffects of Plaintiff \u2019s headaches.  There is  no suggestion in \nPlaintiff\u2019 s applications or elsewhere in the record that his \nheadaches would keep him from performing work functions.  The record before the ALJ reflected that Plaintiff\u2019 s headaches were \nsecondary to his other issues and that he reported them as being as \na side -effect from Remicade, and the record only shows one \ninstance of headaches reported during the period of alleged \ndisability .\n17F18  In short, the record was adequate for the ALJ to make \nhis determination , and he had no duty to further investigate \nrestrictions arising from psychological issues or headaches.  \n  \nPlaintiff also suggests that an attorney might have made \nbetter arguments to the ALJ.  But the mere lack of counsel does \nnot by itself render the proceeding before the ALJ unfair, and it is not an independent basis for a remand.\n18F19   \n  \nFinally, Plaintiff argues that the case should be remanded \nbecause the ALJ that heard it was illegally appointed.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff argues that Acting Commissioner  \nBerryhill\u2019 s tenure had expired under the Federal Vacancies \nReform Act (\u201c FVRA\u201d ) when she ratified the ALJ \u2019s appointment \nin July 2018.  Because the ALJ was not appointed by an agency \n \n17 (See Soc. Sec. Admin. Office of Disability Adjudication and Review Transcript, R. 37\u2013\n39 (covering generally an exchange  where the  ALJ confirms with Plaintiff  and his father that he  \nhas the entire ty of Plaintiff \u2019s medical  record s in the record before him  and explains  that he will  \n\u201cleave the record open for a period of seven days \u201d and if they find \u201c some additional records that \nwe need to obtain\u201d  to let him know and \u201c we\u2019ll request them\u201d ).) \n \n18 (See R. 987.)  \n \n19 Livingston v. Califano, 614 F.2d 342, 345 (3d Cir. 1980).  \n 9 \n head, Plaintiff contends, the appointment violated the \nAppointments Clause  of the Constitution.  The majority of courts \nto have addressed that argument, including courts in this circuit, have rejected it, concluding that Ms. Berryhill was lawfully serving as Acting Commissioner when she ratified ALJ appointments in July 2018.\n19F20  I am persuaded by their reasoning \nand reject Plaintiff \u2019s argument.  \n \n  \n \n20 See, e.g, Neale v.
