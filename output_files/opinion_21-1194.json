ZENON, \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 21-1194-RGA \nV. \nDOVER DOWNS, INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nWilliam D. Fletcher, Jr., SCHMITTINGER & RODRIGUEZ, P.A., Dover, DE. \nAttorney for Plaintiff. \nJames H. McMackin, III, MORRIS JAMES LLP, Wilmington, DE. \nAttorney for Defendant. \nJune 26, 2022 \n1 ~~II TATES DISTRICT JUDGE: \nOn August 20, 2021, Plaintiff, Cindy Zenon, brought claims of employment discrimination \nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, and the analogous \nDelaware state statute, 19 Del. C. \u00a7 711, against her former employer, Dover Downs. (D.I. 1 11 \n29-34). Defendant filed its Answer on October 25, 2021, asserting 65 defenses. (D.I. 10).1 \nDefendant's Answer made no mention of the parties' arbitration agreement. (Id.). On January 26, \n2022, Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss Plaintiff's claims. (D.I. 20). That \nmotion is before me now. I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 21, 23, 25). \nI. Background \nOn February 3, 2009, shortly after she was hired by Defendant , Plaintiff signed a five-page \n\"Employment Disputes Resolution Agreement \" (\"the Arbitration Agreement \"). (D.I. 21-1). The \nArbitration Agreement requires that \"any dispute that may arise out of [Plaintiff's] employment ,\" \nincluding \"any claims relating to discrimination , including those based on ... age ... ,\" be submitted \nto binding arbitration. (Id. at 2, 4 ). The Arbitration Agreement includes a delegation clause stating, \n\"Claims relating to the enforceability ofthis Agreement shall also be subject to arbitration and the \narbitrator shall be instructed to sever from this Agreement any provisions which the arbitrator \ndeems legally unenforceable. \" (Id. at 4). \nPlaintiff argues the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable , and therefore unenforceable, \nbecause (1) it eliminates an employee's right to recover punitive damages , and (2) it requires that \nthe non-prevailing party pay attorneys' fees and costs of the prevailing party. (D.I. 23 at 4-12 (citing \nThe 23rd defense is, \"Some or all of Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable \nlimitations period and/or were not brought in a timely manner.\" The 39th defense is, \"The statute \nof limitations bars certain claims.\" The 4 l51 defense is, \"Not all claims were asserted via a timely \ncharge, and are thus barred by the statute of limitations or a failure to exhaust administrative \nremedies .\" Readers can be their own judges about such pleading. \n2 D.I. 21-1 subsections (d), (g))). Defendant responds that the suit should nevertheless be dismissed \nand submitted for arbitration , because, under the terms of the Arbitration Agreement , questions of \nunconscionability and enforceability are subject to arbitration. (D.I. 25 at 4-6). \nII. Analysis \nAs a threshold matter, I note that, although Defendant preemptively addresses waiver of its \ncontractual right to compel arbitration in its opening brief, Plaintiff does not make a waiver \nargument in her answering brief. (D.I. 21 at 7-8; D.I. 23). Thus, normally , I would not address \nwaiver because it has not been raised by Plaintiff. I note, however, that Defendant's preemptive \nargument regarding waiver -and presumably Plaintiff's decision not to raise a waiver argument -\nrelies on the Third Circuit's Hoxworth test for assessing whether sufficient prejudice exists to \nsupport a finding of waiver. (D.I. 21 at 7 (citing Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson , & Co., 980 F.2d \n912, 926-27 (3d Cir. 1992) (\"prejudice is the touchstone for determining whether the right to \narbitrate has been waived\"))) . Since the parties filed their briefs, the continued viability of the \nHoxworth test has been called into question by the Supreme Court's recent holding in Morgan v. \nSundance , Inc. that a court may not impose a more exacting standard for waiver of the right to \nenforce an arbitration agreement than it imposes for waiver of any other contractual right. 142 S. \nCt. 1708 (May 23, 2022). The Court explained , \"the usual federal rule of waiver does not include \na prejudice requirement,\" and therefore , \"Section 6 [of the FAA] instructs that prejudice is not a \ncondition of finding that a party, by litigating too long, waived its right to stay litigation or compel \narbitration under the FAA.\" Id. at 1714. \nNevertheless , I do not think Defendant has waived its right to enforce the parties' \narbitration agreement here. The Court explains in Sundance that a proper waiver inquiry should \nfocus on the defendant's conduct; specifically , \"Did [the defendant] ... knowingly relinquish the \n3 right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with that right?\" Id. In Sundance, where the Supreme \nCourt vacated and remanded the Court of Appeal's reversal of the district court's finding of waiver, \nthe defendant (1) filed a motion to dismiss the suit against it on other grounds, (2) filed an answer \nasserting 14 affirmative defenses (none mentioning the arbitration agreement), (3) participated in \nmediation proceedings, and ( 4) waited eight months after the suit's filing before moving to compel \narbitration. Id. at 2-3. Here, by contrast, although Defendant's Answer does not mention the \nArbitration Agreement, Defendant's motion to compel arbitration is its first substantive motion in \nthis case, and the motion was filed within six months of the initial filing of this suit. Other than \n\"Initial Disclosures\" (D.I. 16), Defendant has served no discovery. I do not think that Defendant's \nactions evince an intent to \"knowingly relinquish the right to arbitrate by acting inconsistently with \nthat right.\" Id. at 7; see Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Domtar Co., 204 F. Supp. 3d 731, 737 (D. Del. Aug. \n31, 2016) (\"an affirmative defense should be asserted in the appropriate responsive pleading,\" but \n\"the failure to do so does not automatically result in waiver,\" and, \"a defendant does not waive an \naffirmative defense if he raised the issue at a pragmatically sufficient time, and the plaintiff was \nnot prejudiced in its ability to respond\") ( cleaned up). \nNext, I turn to the issue of unconscionability and enforceability. Plaintiff argues that, \nalthough a party to a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement is entitled to an order compelling \narbitration, before granting such an order, a court must first decide the threshold issue of the \nagreement's enforceability, and a court may find an agreement unenforceable on the basis of \nunconscionability. (D.1. 23 at 3 (citing Alexander v. Anthony Int'/, L.P., 341 F. 3d 256, 264 (3d \nCir. 2003); Parilla v. !AP Worldwide Servs. VL Inc., 368 F.3d 269,276 (3d Cir. 2004))). Defendant \nresponds that, where an arbitration agreement has a delegation provision delegating decisions on \nenforceability to an arbitrator, for a court to reach the question of the arbitration agreement's \n4 enforceability, the party opposing arbitration must specifically challenge the enforceability of the \nagreement's delegation clause. (D.I. 25 at 4 (citing Rent-A-Center , West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. \n63, 69-70 (2010))). \nThe facts in Rent-A-Center are closely analogous to the facts here. There, the district court \ngranted Rent-A-Center 's motion to dismiss the proceedings and compel arbitration because the \nagreement had a delegation clause giving the arbitrator \"exclusive authority to decide whether the \nAgreement [was] enforceable ,\" and the plaintiff challenged the validity of the agreement as a \nwhole, rather than the enforceability of the delegation clause specifically. Id. at 66. The Court of \nAppeals reversed in part, finding the district court, rather than the arbitrator, should have decided \nthe issue of the agreement's enforceability. Id. at 66-67. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that, \nbecause the plaintiff \"challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole,\" and, \"Nowhere in \nhis opposition to Rent-A-Center's motion to compel arbitration did he even mention the delegation \nprovision,\" the threshold issue of enforceability was for the arbitrator to decide. Id. at 71-72. \nThe Third Circuit has since relied on Rent-A-Center to hold, \"A court cannot reach the \nquestion of the arbitration agreement's enforceability unless a party challenged the delegation \nclause ... ,\" and, \"A party contesting the enforceability of a delegation clause must challenge the \ndelegation provision specifically.\" MacDonald v. CashCall, Inc., 883 F.3d 220, 226 (3d Cir. 2018) \n( cleaned up). \"[C]ontesting the validity of an arbitration agreement as a whole, without specifically \ndisputing the delegation clause contained therein, is not sufficient to challenge the delegation \nprovision .\" Id. at 227 \"Without a specific challenge to a delegation provision, the court must treat \nthat provision as valid and enforce it according to FAA \u00a7 4.\" Id. \nHere, Plaintiff's unconscionability challenge is directed solely toward two provisions of \nthe Arbitration Agreement, subsections (d) and (g). Plaintiff neither challenges nor mentions the \n5 enforceability of the delegation provision, subsection G), as required to avoid its enforcement. \nTherefore, the question of the Arbitration Agreement's unconscionability is for the arbitrator to \ndecide. \nDefendant's motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED . At this time, Defendant's motion \nto dismiss is DENIED, because the disposition of this case depends on the arbitrator's decision \nregarding the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement. Therefore, this Court will retain \njurisdiction and stay this case pending the outcome of arbitration . The parties should submit a \nstatus update on the progress of the arbitration no later than six months from the date of this \nopm10n. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n6 "}
