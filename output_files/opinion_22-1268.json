Case No. 20-10910-KBO \nAdv. No. 22-50255-KBO \nCiv. No. 22-1268-GBW \nBefore the Court is the motion (D.1. 1) (\"Motion to Withdraw the Reference \") of Jeoffrey \nL. Burtch, as Chapter 7 Trustee (\"Trustee\"), plaintiff in the above-captioned adversary \nproceeding (\"Adversar y Proceeding \") 1 currently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court \nfor the District of Delaware (\"Bankruptc y Court\"), seeking an order withdrawing reference of the \nAdversary Proceeding, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d) \"but only when the case is trial ready.\" \n(D.I. 1 at 2). For the reasons set forth herein, the Motion to Withdraw the Reference is denied \nwithout prejudice to Trustee's right to renew his request at such time as the Adversary \nProceeding is ready for a jury trial. \n1 The docket of the Adversary Proceeding , captioned Burtch v. Zachem, et al., Adv. No. 22-50255-\nKBO (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Adv. D.I. _.\" The docket of the Chapter 7 cases, \ncaptioned In re TZEW Holdco LLC, No. 20-10910-KBO (Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Bankr. \nD.I. ,, I. BACKGROUND \nOn April 8, 2020, TZEW Holdco LLC, together with certain affiliates (\"Debtors\") filed \nvoluntary cases under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Bankr. D.I. 1). On February 17, \n2021, the Debtors' chapter 11 cases were converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy \nCode, and the Trustee was appointed . (Bankr. D.I. 552, 553). \nOn April 7, 2022, the Trustee filed his Complaint for Damages and Other Relief and \nDemand for Jury Trial (Adv. D.I. 1) initiating the Adversary Proceeding. In the Complaint, the \nTrustee seeks an award of damages and other relief against certain of the Debtors' former \ndirectors and officers for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties under Delaware law and other \napplicable law. \nOn July 15, 2022, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss or Abstain (Adv. D.I. 22) and \nJoint Brief in Support thereof (Adv. D.I. 23), with Defendants Michael Short and Jeffrey Dane \nfiling a Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion (Adv. D.I. 24), along \nwith Declarations in support thereof (Adv. D.I. 25, 26). \nNotwithstanding the ongoing briefing on the dispositive Motions to Dismiss, on \nSeptember 27, 2022, Trustee filed the Motion to Withdraw the Reference. On October 28, 2022, \nTrustee filed his Omnibus Response Brief in Opposition (Adv. D.I. 39) (\"Opposition\") to the \nMotion to Dismiss or Abstain. On December 19, 2022, Defendants filed their Joint Reply Brief \nin Further Support of Defendants ' Motion to Dismiss or Abstain, along with supplemental briefs \nand declarations (Adv. D.I. 42, 43, 44, 45) (collectively, the \"Reply\"). On February 1, 2023, \nDefendants filed a Notice of Subsequent Authority (Adv. D.I. 51). Per the Bankruptcy Court's \nOrder dated March 23, 2023, Trustee shall have through March 30, 2023 to file a Sur-Reply. \n(Adv. D.I. 67). Thus, briefing on the dispositive Motion to Dismiss has not yet concluded. The \ndocket of the Adversary Proceeding reflects no discovery or other recent activity. \n2 Briefing on the Trustee's Motion to Withdraw the Reference is complete. (See DJ. 1, \nAdv. DJ. 15, DJ. 3). The Court did not hear oral argument because the facts and legal \narguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would \nnot be significantly aided by oral argument. \nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW \nDistrict courts \"have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising \nunder title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). Pursuant to \nthe authority granted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a), this Court refers cases arising under title 11 to the \nBankruptcy Court. See Am. Standing Order of Reference , Feb. 29, 2012 (C.J. Sleet). \"The district \ncourt may withdraw, in whole or in part, any case or proceeding referred under this section, on its \nownmotionorontimelymotionofanyparty ,forcauseshown .\" 28U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d). Withrespect \nto such permissive withdrawal , \"[t]he 'cause shown' requirement in section 157(d) creates a \npresumption that Congress intended to have bankruptcy proceedings adjudicated in bankruptcy \ncourt unless rebutted by a contravening policy.\" Hatzel & Buehler, Inc. v. Cent. Hudson Gas & \nElec. Corp., 106 B.R. 367, 371 (D. Del. 1989) (internal quotations omitted). To overcome that \npresumption, the moving party has the burden to prove that cause exists to withdraw the reference. \nSee In re NDEP Corp., 203 B.R. 905, 907 (D. Del. 1996). \nAs noted by the Third Circuit, \"cause\" to withdraw the reference \"will be present in only a \nnarrow set of circumstances.\" In re Pruitt, 910 F.2d 1160, 1171 (3d Cir. 1990) (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted). Although the statute does not define \"cause shown,\" the Third \nCircuit has set forth five factors that may be considered in determining whether cause exists to \nwithdraw the reference : (1) promoting uniformity in bankruptcy administration, (2) reducing \nforum shopping and confusion, (3) fostering the economical use of the debtors' and creditors' \nresources, ( 4) expediting the bankruptcy process, and (5) the timing of the request for withdrawal. \n3 See Pruitt, 910 F.2d at 1168 (discussing non-exhaustive list of factors). Other factors considered \nby courts analyzing whether withdrawal is appropriate are whether the claim is a core bankruptcy \nproceeding or whether it is non-core, and whether the parties have requested a jury trial. In re \nNDEP, 203 B.R. at 908 (citing Hatzel, 106 B.R. at 371, and In re Orion Pictures Corp., 4 F.3d \n1095, 1101 (2d Cir.1993)) . \nIII. ANALYSIS \nTrustee's Motion to Withdraw the Reference does not mention, let alone address, the \nPruitt factors. Trustee simply argues that his right to a jury trial, which the Bankruptcy Court \ncannot conduct, and his unwillingness to consent to the Bankruptcy Court's adjudication of \nsame, constitutes sufficient \"cause\" for withdrawing the reference as it will \"promote judicial \neconomy and timely resolution.\" (D.I. 1 at 3). Trustee concedes that \"all pre-trial matters, \nincluding case dispositive motions\" should be heard and decided by the Bankruptcy Court. See \nGeneral Elec. Capital Corp. v. Teo, 2001 WL 1715777, at *4 (D. N.J. Dec. 14, 2001) (\"Even \nwhen a district court must ultimately preside over a trial by jury, there is no reason why the \nBankruptcy Court may not preside over an adversary proceeding and adjudicate discovery \ndisputes and motions only until such time as the case is ready for trial\"). Trustee maintains, \nhowever, that entry of an order withdrawing reference of the Adversary Proceeding at a future, \npossible date is somehow appropriate now. According to Defendants, the fact that Trustee has \ndemanded a jury trial is insufficient to establish cause to withdraw the Adversary Proceeding at \nthis time. I agree with Defendants. \nAlthough Trustee may be entitled to a jury trial, his potential entitlement at some future \ndate is not sufficient grounds to withdraw the reference at this time. Rather,\"[w]ithdrawal of the \nreference based on the ground that a party is entitled to a jury trial should be deferred until the case \nis 'trial ready.\"' In re Big V Holding Corp., 2002 WL 1482392, at *5 (D. Del. July 11, 2002) \n4 (citing In re Northwestern Institute of Psychiatry , Inc., 268 B.R. 79, 84 (E.D. Pa. 2001) and Barlow \n& Peek, Inc. v. Manke Truck Lines, Inc., 163 B.R. 177, 179 (D. Nev. 1993) (refusing to withdraw \nreference until \"it is clear that a jury trial will be necessary and that the case is prepared and ready \nfor such trial to commence\")) . \nAlthough assertion of a right to jury trial coupled with refusal to consent to such trial before \nthe bankruptcy court is not \"itself sufficient cause for discretionary withdrawal,\" it is one of the \nfactors the Court considers . See Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors v. Fed. Indus. Prods., \n2007 WL 211179 at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 26, 2007). \"Withdrawal of the reference ... depends on \nparticular circumstances of each case, including whether the case is likely to reach trial\" but \ngenerally \"such a right [to jury trial] does not compel withdrawing the reference until the case is \nready to proceed to trial.\" Schneider v. Riddick (In re Formica Corp.), 305 B.R. 147, 150 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2004); Hunnicutt Co. v. TJX Cos. (In re Ames Dep't Stores), 190 B.R. 157, 162 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1995). In deciding whether to withdraw a case from the bankruptcy court based on a \njury demand, courts consider (1) whether the case is likely to reach trial; (2) whether protracted \ndiscovery with court oversight will be required; and (3) whether the bankruptcy court is familiar \nwith the issues presented. In re Enron Corp., 317 B.R. 232,235 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). \nWith respect to the first factor, the case remains in the earliest stages oflitigation. Briefing \non dispositive motions is not yet even complete. The pending motions to dismiss may prevent the \nmatter from ever proceeding to trial. \"One can only speculate when it will proceed to trial, if at \nall.\" In re Enron, 317 B.R. at 235. With respect to the second factor-whether protracted \ndiscovery with court oversight will be required-gi ven the stage of the matter, it is unclear at this \npoint whether any discovery at all will required. Assuming Defendants do not prevail on their \nMotion to Dismiss or Abstain, however, it is safe to assume that significant discovery-and \nBankruptcy Court oversight of same-would be required to adjudicate a Complaint which asserts \n5 breach of fiduciary duty claims against eight separate individuals. Finally, with respect to the third \nfactor-whether the Bankruptcy Court is familiar with the issues presented-the Bankruptcy Court \nhere has overseen the Debtors' cases for almost three years, is already familiar with the facts of \nboth the Adversary Proceeding and the Chapter 7 cases, and is therefore in the best position to \nadjudicate pretrial motions and discovery disputes. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained above, the Court will deny the Motion to Withdraw the Reference \nof the Adversary Proceeding without prejudice to the Trustee's right to renew his request at such \ntime as it is ready for jury trial. \nMarch-n, 2023 A separate Order will be~ w~ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nIN RE: TZEW HOLDCO LLC, et al., \nDebtors.
