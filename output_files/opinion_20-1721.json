Civil Action No. 21-1721-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nI. BACKGROUND \nPetitioner Denzel Massengill (\"Petitioner\") has filed papers challenging his \npretrial detainment in the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington \nDelaware. (D.I. 1) It appears that Petitioner is awaiting a violation of probation hearing, \nand he contends he is \"being illegally detained and imprisoned with no bail reduction in \n3 months on a cash bail under false pretenses [in violation of his following rights]: 8th \nAmendment -cruel and unusual punishment; 6th amendment -fast and speedy trial; \nand 5th and 14th Amendments -due process rights.\" (D.I. 1 at 2) Petitioner asks for \nimmediate release by \"having the charges against him dismissed with prejudice or at \nthe very least compelling the lower court to grant [him] bail.\" (D.I. 1 at 3) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA district court judge may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly \nappears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is \n1 not entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. As a general rule, a federal district \ncourt can only entertain a habeas petition in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to \nthe judgment of a State court, and a petitioner is not entitled to federal habeas relief \nunless he has exhausted state remedies for his habeas claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) \nand (b)(1)(A); see also Rules 1-2, 28 U.S.C. foll.\u00a7 2254. Although a state prisoner can \nchallenge his pre-trial custody on speedy trial grounds pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, a \nfederal court cannot provide habeas review for pre-trial claims if the petitioner is trying \nto abort his state criminal proceeding, because such adjudication would constitute \npremature litigation of constitutional defenses in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2254(b); Moore v. De Young, 515 F.2d 437, 441-42 (3d Cir. 1975); Braden v. 30th \nJudicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U.S. 484,493 (1973) (noting that habeas corpus \nreview is not available to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state \ncriminal charge prior to a state court conviction, but that, in special circumstances, \nhabeas corpus is the appropriate vehicle by which to demand enforcement of a state's \nconstitutional obligation to provide a speedy trial). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nAfter reviewing the instant Petition, the Court concludes that summary dismissal \nis appropriate. First, the face of the Petition demonstrates that Petitioner is not custody \npursuant to a state court judgment, because he has not yet had his violation of \nprobation hearing concerning the charges for which he is now detained. Second, \nPetitioner's request that the Court dismiss all charges against him with prejudice \ndemonstrates that he is seeking the dismissal of all charges against him. And finally, it \n2 appears that Petitioner has not exhausted his state remedies with respect to his bail \nissue, and nothing in his Petition demonstrates extraordinary circumstances justifying \nthe Court's interference with a pending state court proceeding without Petitioner having \nfirst exhausted state remedies. See Moore, 515 F.2d at 443. Accordingly , the Court will \nsummarily dismiss the instant Petition for failing to present a proper basis for pre-trial \nhabeas relief. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant \nPetition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because \nPetitioner has failed to make a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional \nright.\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, \n113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order will be entered. \nDated: March 7, 2022 \nChief Judge \n3 "}
