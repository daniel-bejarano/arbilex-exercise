Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Defendant s\u2019 Partial Motion to Dismiss.   (D.I. 9).   I have considered  the \nparties\u2019 briefing .  (D.I. 10, 12, 13).  For the reasons that follow , I will DENY the motion .   \nI. BACKGROUND \n \nPlaintiff Dr. Mark A. Barry filed a c omplaint for patent infringement against Defendants \nSeaSpine Holdings Corp., SeaSpine Orthopedics Corp., and SeaSpine, Inc. (together, \n\u201cSeaSpine\u201d).  (D.I. 1).  In Count IV of the complaint, Dr. Barry asserts that SeaSpine\u2019s Daytona \nSystem induces infringement of at least claim 6 of U.S. Patent No. 9,668,787 (\u201cthe \u2019787 patent\u201d) .  \n(Id. at \u00b6 92).  SeaSpine filed a partial motion to dismiss Count IV for failure to state a claim \nunder Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that claim 6 does not c ontain patent eligible subject matter under \u00a7 \n101.  (D.I. 9).  \nThe \u2019787 patent is entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Aligning Vertebrae in the \nAmelioration of Aberrant Spinal Column Deviation Conditions.\u201d   It generally relates to systems \nand methods for correct ing spinal deformities, including scoliosis.  (\u2019787 patent, 1:29\u201331).    \nClaim 6 of the \u2019787 patent recites:  \n6.  A method of applying a manipulative force to a targe t region of a spinal column \nduring a s urgical procedure, the  method comprising:  \n \nimplanting a first pedicle screw into a first pedicle of a  first vertebra;  \n \nimplanting a second pedicle screw into a second pedicle  of the first vertebra;  \n implanting a third pedicle s crew into a first pedicle of a second vertebra;  \n implanting a fourth pedicle screw into a second pedicle of  the second vertebra;  \n temporarily engaging a first elongated lever with the first  pedicle screw;  \n temporarily engaging a  second elongated lever with the  second pedicle s crew;  2  \ntemporarily engaging a third elongated lever with the  third pedicle screw;  \n temporarily engaging a fourth elongated lever with the  fourth pedicle screw;  \n \nlinking together the first, second, third and fourth elongated levers in both a \ncraniocaudal  direction and a  transverse direction such that the first, second, third \nand fourth elongated levers move together in unison;  \n \nmoving the linked together first, second, third and fourth elongated levers in unison \nto simultaneously rotate the  first and the second vertebrae through the pedicle  \nscrews about a craniocaudal roll axis; and  \n disengaging the first, second, third and fourth elongated levers from their respective \npedicle screws before concluding the s urgical procedure,   \n installing a spinal rod that extends in a craniocaudal  direction between at least the \nfirst pedicle screw and the third pedicle screw; and  \n between the moving and disengaging steps, tightening spinal rod engagement \nmechanisms on the fi rst and  third pedicle screws to secure the spinal rod to the first  \nand third pedicle screws.  \n (Id., 8:14\u201350).  \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss  \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  Rule 12(b)(6) allows the \naccused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard.  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the complaint \nas true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that \nthose allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). 3 The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they m ust provide more than \nlabels, conclusions, or a \u201cformulaic recitation\u201d of the claim elements.  Id. at 555 (\u201cFactual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . on the \nassumption that all the allegations in the co mplaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d).  \nMoreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief.  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when \nthe complain t\u2019s factual content \u201callows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (\u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line betwe en possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nB. Patent -Eligible Subject Matter  \nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent -eligible subject matter.  It provides: \n\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and use ful process, machine, manufacture, or \ncomposition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The Supreme Court \nrecognizes three categories of subject matter that are not eligible for patents \u2014laws of nature, \nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas.  Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int \u2019l, 573 U.S. 208, 216 \n(2014).  The purpose of these exceptions is to protect the \u201cbasic tools of scientific and \ntechnological work.\u201d  Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab\u2019ys , Inc. , 566 U.S. 66, 71 \n(2012).  \nIn Alice , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the framework laid out in Mayo  \u201cfor \ndistinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract i deas from \nthose that claim patent- eligible applications of those concepts.\u201d  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217.  First, 4 the court must determine whether the claims are drawn to a patent -ineligible concept.  Id.  If the \nanswer is yes, the court must look to \u201cthe eleme nts of the claim both individually and as an \nordered combination\u201d to see if there is an \u201cinventive concept \u2014i.e., an element or combination of \nelements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than \na patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\u201d  Id. at 217\u201318 (cleaned up).   \nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue.  Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. \n593, 602 (2010) .  Accordingly, the \u00a7 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is \napparent from the face of the patent that the asserted claims are not directed to eligible subject matter.  See Cleveland Clinic Found. v. True Health Diagnostics LLC , 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017), cert. denied , 138 S. Ct. 2621 (2018) .  This is, however, appropriate \u201conly when \nthere are no factual allegations that, taken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\u201d  Aatrix Software, Inc. v . Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. \nCir. 2018).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n \nFirst, I must determine whether claim 6  as a whole is  directed to an abstract idea.  \nAlice , 573 U.S. at 218.  \u201cThe \u2018abstract ideas\u2019 category embodies \u2018the longstanding rule \nthat an idea of itself is not patentable.\u2019\u201d   Id. (quoting Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, \n67 (1972)).  \u201cThe Supreme Court has not established a definitive rule to determine what \nconstitutes an \u2018abstract idea\u2019 sufficient to satisfy the first step of the Mayo /Alice  inquiry.\u201d  \nEnfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  The Supreme \nCourt has recognized, however, that \u201cfundamental economic practice[s],\u201d Bilski, 561 U.S. \nat 611, \u201cmethod[s] of organizing human activity,\u201d Alice , 573 U.S. at  220, and \nmathematical algorithms, Benson, 409 U.S. at 64, are abstract ideas.  In navi gating the 5 parameters of such categories, courts have generally sought to \u201ccompare claims at issue \nto those claims already found to be directed to an abstract idea in previous cases.\u201d  \nEnfish , 822 F.3d at 1334. \n\u201c[T]o avoid ineligibility, a claim must \u2018 have  the specificity required to transform \nthe claim from one claiming only a result to one claiming a way of achieving it.\u2019 \u201d  Am. \nAxle &  Mfg., Inc.  v. Neapco  Holdings  LLC , 967 F.3d 1285, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2020)  \n(quoting SAP Am.,  Inc. v. InvestPic,  LLC , 898 F.3d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ) (cleaned \nup), petition for cert. filed , No. 20- 891 (Dec. 28, 2020) .  \u201c[T]he claim itself . . . must go \nbeyond stating a functional result; it must identify \u2018how\u2019 that functional result is achieved \nby limiting the claim scope to structures specified at some level of concreteness, in the \ncase of a product claim, or to concrete action, in the case of a method claim.\u201d  Id. at \n1302. \nSeaSpine argues t hat claim 6 is directed to the abstract idea of \u201crotating two or \nmore vertebrae at the same time,\u201d also known as \u201cen bloc  derotation.\u201d  (D.I. 10 at 1).  I \nam not convinced that \u201c en bloc  derotation\u201d is an abstract idea as it is a concrete surgical \nprocedure , not a mental process or mathematical algorithm.  The  cases cited by SeaSpine \ndo not convince me otherwise as these cases are not closely  analogous to the claim here .  \nSee, e.g., Yu v. Apple , 1 F.4th 1040, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 2021)  (directed to the abstract idea of \nusing one picture  to enhance  the other picture) ; American Axle, 967 F.3d at  1298 \n(directed to a natural law); ChargePoint, Inc. v. Sema Connect, Inc., 920 F.3d 759, 770 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (directed to the abstract idea of c ommunicating over a network for \ndevice interaction) .  6 SeaSpine instead  argues that claim 6  is directed to an abstract idea because it \nimpermissibly  recites the result of en bloc  derotation, rather than how to achieve this \nresult.  (D.I. 10 at 8\u20139).  Dr. Barry responds that claim 6 is directed to \u201ca specific \nconfiguration used for en bloc  derotation, including using two derotators  on each of at \nleast two vertebrae and linking the derot ators both along and across the spine.\u201d  (D.I. 12 \nat 1).   \nSeaSpine compares claim 6 to the claims at issue in Am erican  Axle &  \nManufacturi ng, Inc.  v. Neapco  Holdings  LLC .  The patent at  issue  in American Axle \nclaimed \u201ca method of manufacturing a driveline  propshaft containing a liner designed \nsuch that its frequencies attenuate two modes of vibration simultaneously and . . . a \nmanufacturing method to tuning liners to attenuate bending mode vibrati on.\u201d  American \nAxle, 967 F.3d at 1292\u201393.  The Federal Circuit held that the patent was  ineligi ble under \n\u00a7 101 because it was  directed to the use of a natural law (Hooke\u2019s law) .  Id. at 1298.  \nThe Court reasoned that the claim s at issue simply claimed the desired result of tuning a \nliner such that it attenuates two different vibration modes , \u201cby whatever structures or \nsteps happen to work. \u201d  Id. at 1295.  The claims  failed to include \u201cany physical structure \nor steps for achieving the clai med result.\u201d   Id.  SeaSpine argues that claim 6 similarly \nonly recites the desired result  of en bloc  derotation.  (D.I. 10 at 10\u201311).  \nI find SeaSpine\u2019s reliance on American Axle unpersuasive.  The claim at issue in \nAmerican Axle simply recited \u201c tuning a mass and a stiffness of at least one liner.\u201d   (U.S. \nPatent No. 7,774,911, claim 22).  Claim 6 of the \u2019787 patent does not simply recite \n\u201crotating two or more vertebrae at the same time.\u201d  Instead, claim 6 discloses how to \nachieve this result.  Specifically , claim 6 recites the steps of (1) implanting two pedicle 7 screws on each o f at least  two vertebrae; (2) temporarily engaging elongated levers with \neach pedicle screw; (3) linking together the four elongated levers along and across  the \nspine  such that the levers move together in unison; and (4) moving the linked elongated \nlevers in unison to simultaneously rotate the first and second vertebrae through the \npedicle screws about a craniocaudal roll axis .  (\u2019787 patent, 8:14\u201340).   Unlike the claim \nin American Axle, claim 6 recites a specific configuration of surgical tools and steps for achieving the claimed result .\n1 \nFinally, SeaSpine argues that claim 6 of the \u2019787 patent preempts all methods of \nperforming en bloc  derotation.  (D.I. 10 at 20).   But, as I concluded above, claim  6 is \nlimited to a particular configuration for performing en bloc  derotation.  Whether this \nclaimed configuration is in fact the only way to perform en bloc  derotation is not  \nsomething I can decide on a mot ion to dismiss.  \n In sum, I conclude that claim 6 is not directed to an abstract idea.  Accordingly, I \nneed not reach Alice  Step Two.  SeaSpine\u2019s motion to dismiss Count IV is denied.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue.  \n \n1 SeaSpine argues that the claimed steps are too general.  (D.I. 10 at 8\u201310).  For example, one \nlimitation  requires \u201cmoving the linked together first, second, third and fourth elongated levers in \nunison to simultaneously rotate the first and the second vertebrae through the pedicle screws \nabout a craniocaudal roll axis. \u201d  (\u2019787 patent, 8:37\u201340).  SeaSpine argues that this claim \nlimitation fails to explain how much force the surgeon should apply to rotate the vertebrae ; ergo, \nit is directed to a result.  (D.I. 10 at 10).  I do not think this is a reasonable argument to make, \non a motion to dismiss , in support of a  conclusion of abstractness.  Section 101 does not require \nthat claims go into such a level of detail.  Enablement might require more, and perhaps \nSeaS pine will make a  similar  enablement argument (although I would be surprised if it turns out \nspinal surgeons  did not understand how much force to apply).  See Am erican Axle, 967 F.3d at \n1302 (discussing the \u201chow\u201d requirements of \u00a7 101 and enablement) .  But, for \u00a7 101 purposes , I \nconclude that c laim 6 has sufficiently  recited  steps for performing en bloc  derotation.  8  \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nDR.
