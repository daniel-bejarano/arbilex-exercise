No. 21-1498-GBW\n\nVv.\n\nAMAZON.COM, INC., et al.,\n\nSS SS SS AS YS SH OH\n\nDefendants.\n\nLynette M. Walley, New Castle, Delaware, Pro se Plaintiff.\nJody Barillare, Esquire, Ann Marie Effingham, Esquire, and Emily C. DeSmedt,\n\nEsquire, Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for\nDefendant Amazon.com Services LLC.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nSeptember \\b , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nyaain\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Lynette M. Walley who appears pro se and has paid the filing fee,\ncommenced this employment discrimination and retaliation claim on October 25,\n2021. (D.I.2) Before the Court are Plaintiffs requests for counsel,! motion for\nan extension of time, and motion to stay and Defendant Amazon.com Services\nLLC\u2019s (improperly named as Amazon.com Inc) motion to dismiss. (D.I. 4, 9, 17,\n22,24) The matters have been briefed.\n\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Amazon and its employees retaliated against her for a\nnumber of reasons. She does not invoke any federal discrimination statute in her\nComplaint. On February 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed an EEOC notice of suit rights,\nEEOC No. 17C-2018-00349. (D.I.8) A few days later she filed a motion for an\nextension of time to properly amend the complaint, correct the defendants, seek an\nattorney, and serve defendants. (D.I. 9)\n\nAmazon moves to dismiss the Complaint. (D.I.17) Attached to the\n\nmotion is Plaintiff's charge of discrimination for EEOC No. 17C-2018-00349\n\n' Plaintiff sought and was denied in forma pauperis status based upon her annual\nincome. (D.I. 1,5) Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1) the court may request an\nattorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel. The Court finds that\nPlaintiff does not meet that standard and, therefore, her requests will be denied.\nThe Court will also deny that portion of Plaintiff's motion for an extension of time\nto seek counsel. There is no imposed Court deadline to do so.\n\n1\nasserting retaliation and disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act and\nthe Delaware Persons with Disabilities Employment Protections Act. (D.I. 18-1\nat 2) Amazon\u2019s grounds for dismissal include: the Complaint does not properly\nallege discrimination or failure to accommodate claims under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et seq., the ADA retaliation\nclaim fails because Plaintiff did not engage in protected activity under Title VII or\nthe ADA; she does not timely assert a workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim;\nand the claims against the individual defendants fail to state claims upon which\nrelief can be granted and they were never served. (D.I. 18) Plaintiff responded\nto the motion to dismiss by filing a combined motion to stay\u201d and a reply brief in\nsupport of her motion to stay that contains her opposition to dismissal and raises\nfacts not contained in the Complaint. (D.I. 22,25) Amazon notes that the\nopposition was untimely and the brief is actually an improper sur-reply. (D.I. 27)\nTl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).\nBecause Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her\n\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\n\n2? The motion to stay will be denied. (D.I. 22)\n2\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94. A court\nmay consider the pleadings, public record, orders, exhibits attached to the\ncomplaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference. Tellabs,\nInc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).\n\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim\nof entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u2019\u201d\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019 Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,\n241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). The Court is \u201cnot\nrequired to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly alleged in the\ncomplaint.\u201d In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d\nCir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, however, \u201cfor imperfect statement\nof the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d Johnson v. City of Shelby, 135\nS. Ct. 346, 346 (2014).\n\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has\n\u201csubstantive plausibility.\u201d Jd. at 347. That plausibility must be found on the face\n\nof the complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has\nfacial plausibility when the [complainant] pleads factual content that allows the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the [accused] is liable for the\nmisconduct alleged.\u201d Jd. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial\nexperience and common sense.\u201d Jd. at 679.\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nA. ADA, Discrimination and Failure to Accommodate\n\nAmazon seeks dismissal on the grounds that the Complaint does not\nproperly allege discrimination or failure to accommodate claims under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, et seq.\nPlaintiff seeks leave to amend the Complaint. (D.I.9) Plaintiff's opposition\nprovides new facts that are not in the Complaint. Plaintiff may not amend her\nComplaint through her opposition, and new facts may not be considered by the\nCourt. See Commonwealth of Pa. ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d\n173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988) (citing Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d\n1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984)) (\u201c[l]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be\namended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.\u201d).\n\nTo establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Plaintiff must establish that\nshe (1) has a disability, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) has suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action because of that disability. McNelis v. Pennsylvania Power &\nLight Co., 867 F.3d 411, 414 (3d Cir. 2017). To state a claim for disability\ndiscrimination under the ADA based on an alleged failure to accommodate a\ndisability, Plaintiff must demonstrate that she: (1) is a disabled person within the\nmeaning of the ADA; (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions\nof the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3)\nhas suffered an otherwise adverse employment decision as a result of\ndiscrimination which includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations for\nher disability. See Hohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 186-87 (3d\nCir. 2009).\n\nUpon review of the Complaint, and for the reasons set forth by Amazon, the\nCourt agrees that the Complaint fails to state a claim for disability discrimination\nunder the ADA and fails to state a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA.\nAmazon\u2019s motions to dismiss these claims will be granted. Because it is possible\nthat Plaintiff may be able to state a claim upon amendment, that portion of\nPlaintiff's motion to properly amend the complaint will be granted ONLY as to\nthese two claims. (D.I. 9)\n\nDefendants move for dismissal of the ADA claims raised against the\nindividual defendants as the ADA does not provide for individual liability. To\nthe extent Plaintiff intended to raise ADA claims against the individual defendants,\n\nthe law is well-established in the Third Circuit that parties cannot be held liable in\ntheir individual capacities under the ADA. See Koslow v. Pennsylvania, 302 F.3d\n161, 178 (3d Cir. 2002) (no individual liability under the ADA). Accordingly, the\nCourt will grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the ADA claims against the\nindividual defendants. There is no need to address the issue that the individual\ndefendants were not served. In addition, the Court will deny that portion of\nPlaintiffs motion to correct the listed defendants. (D.I. 9)\n\nTo the extent Plaintiff raises a retaliation claim under the ADA, it fails as a\nmatter of law. The complaint alleges retaliation occurred by reason of Plaintiff\nfiling a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Filing a claim for workers\u2019 compensation\ndoes not constitute protected activity under either Title VII or the ADA and, thus,\nPlaintiff cannot meet the elements of a retaliation claim. See Lanza v. Postmaster\nGen. of U.S., 570 F. App\u2019x 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Reynolds v. American\nNat\u2019l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 154 (4th Cir. 2012) (finding that \u201c[filing a\nworkers\u2019 compensation claim is not something that is covered by the ADA\u201d and\nthat retaliation for making such claim is not actionable under ADA). Accordingly,\nthe Court will grant the motion to dismiss the ADA retaliation claim.\n\nFinally, to the extent Plaintiff raises a workers\u2019 compensation retaliation\nclaim, the claim is time-barred under 19 Del. C. \u00a7 2365 which has a two-year\nstatute of limitation. Under \u00a7 2365 it is unlawful for any employer or the duly\n\nauthorized agent of any employer to retaliate in any manner against an employee as\nto the employee\u2019s employment because the employee has engaged in protected\nactivity. The Complaint alleges retaliation occurred in March 2018 when Plaintiff\nwas placed on a leave of absence; yet Plaintiff did not commence this action until\nOctober 25, 2021, long past the two-year limitation period. Notably, Plaintiff was\nnot required to exhaust her workers\u2019 compensation claim under Delaware law, see\n19 Del. C.\u00a7 2365, and the limitation period was not equitably tolled during the time\nPlaintiff sought to exhaust her administrative remedies under the ADA. See\nLamb-Bowman v. Delaware State Univ., 1999 WL 1250889, at *10 (D. Del. Dec.\n10, 1999) (holding that the statute of limitations on Plaintiff's state wrongful\ndischarge claim was not subject to tolling during the pendency of her EEOC\nadministrative claim); Williams-Jefferies v. AARP, 2016 WL 3166309, at *4\n(D.D.C. June 6, 2016) (Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits have rejected the\nargument that the exhaustion of administrative remedies under Title VII operates to\ntoll the statute of limitations for state-law claims). Thus the workers\u2019\ncompensation retaliation claim is time-barred, and Amazon\u2019s motion to dismiss\nthis claim will be granted.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiff's\nrequests for counsel (D.I. 4, 24); (2) grant Plaintiff's motion for an extension of\n\ntime to file an amended complaint and deny Plaintiff's motion for an extension of\ntime to correct the listed defendants and serve them and retain counsel (D.I. 9);\ngrant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.L. 17); and (2) deny Plaintiff's motion to\nstay (DI. 22). Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the ADA disability claim\nand the ADA failure to accommodate claim.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nLYNETTE M.
