No. 21-569- CFC -JLH \n      \n \nREPORT AND RECOM MENDATION  \nPlaintiff Tyraa Bowe  (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d)  appeals  pro se from an unfavorable decision of the \nCommissioner of the Social Security Administration 0F1 (\u201cSSA\u201d) denying her application for \ndisability insurance benefits.  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).  The parties \nfiled cross -motions for summary judgment. 1F2  (D.I. 22 , 23.)  For the following reasons , the Court \nshould DENY Plaintiff \u2019s motion and GRANT  Defendant \u2019s motion.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence. \u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence \u201c means \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d   Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).  In reviewing \nwhether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts may not \u201c re-weigh the \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kijakazi \nwas automatically substituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she succeeded him on July 9, 2021. \n \n2 Plaintiff filed a \u201cCase Brief \u201d (D.I. 22) , which I will construe as a motion for summary \njudgment.  2 \n evidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d   Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011); see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014).  In other \nwords, reviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u2009404.1520(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis, and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail:  \nThe first two steps involve threshold determinations.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  I f a claimant is \nfound to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissioner compares the medical evidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gai nful work.  If the \nimpairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four  requires the ALJ to consider whether \nthe claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work.  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final step.  At this stage, the burden of production shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments,  age, education, past work experience, and residual \nfunctional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019 s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n 3 \n Newell v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Se c., 347 F.3d 541, 545 \u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks disability insurance benefits or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004).  \nThe Court must liberally construe a pro se  litigant \u2019s filings and \u201c apply the applicable law, \nirrespective of whether she has mentioned it by name.\u201d   Paitsel v. Kijakazi, No. 21- 610-RGA, \n2022 WL 3646287, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 23, 2022)  (quoting Holley v. Dep \u2019t of Veteran Affairs , 165 \nF.3d 244, 247\u201348 (3d Cir. 1999) ).   \nII. BACKGROUND On January 24, 2019, Plaintiff  applied for Social Security disability insurance benefits.  \n(Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 18 ( \u201cRecord\u201d or \u201cR.\u201d) at 61.)  In her application, \nPlaintiff  alleged disability  as a result of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.  (R. 299.)   \nPlaintiff\u2019s application was denied initially and on reconsideration, and she r equested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Law Judge ( \u201cALJ\u201d).  (Id.)  The ALJ held a hearing via telephone on June \n11, 2020.  (Id.)  On June 30, 2020, the ALJ i ssued a decision finding that Plaintiff was not disabled \nwithin the meaning of the Social Security Act .  (Id.) \nThe ALJ determined at step one that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity \nsince May 20, 2019, her alleged onset date.\n2F3  (R. 63.)  He then found at steps two and three that \nPlaintiff had severe impairments of bipolar disorder and depression, but that those impairments did not meet or medically equal the criteria for any of the impairments in the relevant l istings.  (R. \n63\n\u201367.)  The ALJ next determined that Plaintiff  retained the residual functional capacity  (\u201cRFC\u201d)  \nto perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but with the following limitations:  \n \n3 Plaintiff \u2019s original alleged onset date was December 31, 2017.  (R. 61.)  She amended the \nonset date to May 20, 2019 before the hearing .  (Id.)  4 \n The claimant cannot be exposed to hazards , which  is defined as \nclimbing ro pes, ladders, or scaffolds; using dangerous moving \nmachinery; or, being exposed to unprotected heights. The claimant \nis limited to simple, routine, and  repetitive work, but not at a \nproduction pace.  The claimant can have no more than  incidental and \ninfrequent contact with the general public.  She can occasionally \ninteract  with coworkers and supervisors, but cannot perform tasks \nthat would require her to work in tandem with coworkers to \ncomplete job responsibilities.  The claimant can make simple work  \ndecisions in a stable work environment, which is defined as very \nlittle change in wor k setting or work process.  \n \n(R. 67.)  At steps four and five , the ALJ determined that Plaintiff  could not perform any past work \nbut that she could perform other jobs tha t exist in significant numbers in the national economy.  \n(R. 71\u201373.)  The ALJ concluded that \u201c[a] finding of \u2018not disabled\u2019  is therefore appropriate .\u201d  (R. \n73.)  \nPlaintiff  asked the  Appeals Council  to review the  ALJ\u2019s decision  and to consider  new \nevidence that was not before the ALJ. 3F4  (D.I. 1, Ex. 4;  see also  R. 8\u201348 (evidence in the Appeal s \nCouncil record) ; D.I. 3 (same evidence).)   The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff\u2019s request for \nreview of the ALJ\u2019s decision.  ( R. 1\u20137.)  It stated  that the \u201cevidence [submitted by Plaintiff on \nappeal] does not show a reasonable probability that it would change the outcome of the decision.\u201d   \n(R. 2.)   \n  \n \n4 According to Plaintiff, she was under the impression that the lawyer who represented her \nat the hearing before the ALJ was going to obtain and submit the additional  records to the ALJ, \nbut failed to do so.  ( See R. 195; D.I. 1, Ex. 4.)   5 \n III. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff submitted several filings to this Court, all of which have been considered, \nincluding a letter attached to her Complaint (\u201cthe Letter\u201d) (D.I. 1, Ex. 4), the new medical evidence \nfiled with the Appeals Council that was not before the ALJ (D.I. 3) , 4F5 and a \u201cCase Brief \u201d (D.I. 22). 5F6  \nPlaintiff \u2019s pro se filings touch upon several issues that, though not mentioned explicitly, I have \nconsidered here.  Those include whether substantial evidence supports  the ALJ \u2019s findings , whether \nremand is warranted in light of the additional  evidence not before the ALJ , and whether Plaintiff \u2019s \nlawyer  provided ineffective assistance.   \nA. Challenges to the ALJ\u2019s factual findings  \nPlaintiff  raises several concerns  with the ALJ\u2019s finding that she is not disabled within the \nmeaning of the Social Security Act .   \nPlaintiff first suggests  that the ALJ  did not give enough weight to the  Department of \nVeteran s Affairs \u2019 (\u201cVA\u2019s\u201d) determination that she is unemployable as a result of her disabilities . 6F7  \nPlaintiff submitted records of t he VA\u2019s  determination and the evidence underlying it  to the ALJ .  \nIn his opinion, the ALJ acknowledged the VA \u2019s disability determination in one sentence but did \nnot provide further comment.  (R. 68.)  \n \n5 While this Court may consider the evidence that  Plaintiff  submitted to the Appeals \nCouncil in determining  whether remand is appropriate to allow her  to present that  evidence to the \nALJ, \u201cevidence that was not before the ALJ cannot be used to argue that the  ALJ\u2019s decision was \nnot supported by substantial evidence .\u201d  Matthews v. Apfel , 239 F.3d 589, 594 (3d Cir. 2001) .   \n \n6 The remainder of the documents Plaintiff  submitted are duplicative of records found in \nthe Transcript of Social Security Proceedings .  (D.I. 1 8).   \n \n7 Specifically, on January 11, 2019, the VA determined that Plaintiff\u2019s  disabilities, which \nincluded \u201cBipolar II disorder, [and] current episode de pressed, severe, without psychotic features \nwith alcohol use disorder,\u201d  rendered her 70% disabled and unemployable , and it awarded Plaintiff \nbenefits .  (R. 229 \u2013234.)   6 \n The ALJ\u2019s treatment of the VA\u2019s disability determination was not error.  Section 404.1504  \nof Title 20 of the Code of Federal R egulations  says that a decision by another agency about whether \nsomeone is disabled is not \u201c binding\u201d  on the SSA.  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504.  The  regulations further \nprovide that  the SSA is not required to \u201c provide any analysis in [ its] determination \u201d about the other \nagency \u2019s decision.   Id.  But the SSA  \u201cwill consider all of the supporting evidence underlying\u201d  the \nother agency \u2019s decision that it receives as evidence.  Id.  \nIn short , Plaintiff  is not  entitled to SSA disability insurance benefits simply because she \nreceives benefits from the VA.   And the ALJ \u2019s failure to further discuss the VA\u2019s  disabil ity \ndecision does not constitute reversible error. 7F8   \nPlaintiff next suggests that the ALJ  improperly discounted evidence about the severity of \nher mental health symptoms, which affect her ability to show up to work on a regular basis.  ( See \nD.I. 1, Ex. 4; D.I. 22.)   I understand Plaintif f\u2019s argument , but it is not the role of this Court to \nsecond -guess the ALJ \u2019s fact finding.  Even if the  Court might have come to a different conclusion \non the same evidence, the Court  can only consider whether substantial evidence supported the \nALJ\u2019s findings , including his findings regarding Plaintiff\u2019s RFC and his decision  not to credit \nPlaintiff\u2019s  report s about the severity of her symptoms .  \n Having reviewed the record, I\u2019m compelled to conclude that  substantial evidence does \nsupport the ALJ\u2019s findings .  It is clear from the ALJ \u2019s lengthy and detailed opinion that he was \naware of and took into considerati on all  of her reported symptoms.  He thoroughly summarized \nthe symptoms evidenced by the record.  He wrote, for example,  that Plaintiff  alleges that she sleeps \nall day and that she struggles to get out  of bed, adhere to a schedule, and make it to appointments.  \n \n8 I note that the ALJ did discuss at length the treatment notes from Plaintiff\u2019s VA providers.   \n(R. 64\u201371.)  7 \n (R. 66, 68.)  He wrote that she alleges that she needs reminders to tend to her personal needs, \ngrooming, and medications .  (R. 66, 68.)  He noted  that she reported \u201c decreased energy, low \nmotivation , wanting to sleep all the time, periods of mania, periods of emotional outbursts and \nracing thoughts \u201d to her provider at Mental Edge Counseling.  (R. 68.)  He observed that the records  \nshow that she \u201c has been late for some therapy session s.\u201d  (R. 69.)    \nUltimately, though, the  ALJ found that the severity of Plaintiff\u2019s  reported symptoms was  \ninconsistent with the other  evidence in the record, and he explained why.  (See R. at 69 \n(\u201cUltimately, the  medical evidence and the claimant\u2019s activities of daily living are inconsistent \nwith the claimant\u2019s statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her \nsymptoms . . . .\u201d). )  In particular , the ALJ explain ed that Plaintiff\u2019s alleg ations are inconsistent \n\u201cwith the less severe indications  in the mental status examinations  in the Department of Veteran [s] \nAffairs records ,\u201d noting that the  \u201ctreatment records document that the claimant is generally stable \nwith medications .\u201d  (Id.)  The ALJ also found that Plaintiff\u2019s allegations were inconsistent with \nher daily activities, which included (among others), being \u201cable to go out alone,\u201d  \u201cus[ing] social \nmedia, \u201d and \u201cattend[ing]  group therapy and her appointments on a regular basis.\u201d   (Id.)  In addition, \nthe AL J credited Dr. Patricia Miripol, the state agency psychologist, who  \u201copined that the claimant \ncan carry out simple/routine tasks, make simple work decisions, follow basic work routine, perform within  schedule, can interact with genera l public on occasional basis, would do best in \nlow socia l contact setting, and [has] difficulty managing stressful conditions .\u201d  (R. 70.)   The ALJ \nalso noted that a  second state agency psychologist  confirmed Dr. Miripol \u2019s opinion and that both  \nopinions  were consistent with the \u201c objective exams that show decreased energy, low motivation, \nand periods of racing thoughts, cooperative behavior, fluent speech, orientation, good eye contact, \nlogical thought  process, appropriate associations, intact mem ory, good judgment, and good 8 \n insight. \u201d  (R. 70.)   The ALJ further explained that he  discredited the  extreme limitations endorsed \nby Plaintiff \u2019s treating psychologist , Dr. John Gourley, because of \u201cinternal[] inconsisten t[encies] \u201d \nin his report  and inconsis tencies \u201cwith the claimant\u2019 s treatment records. \u201d  (R. 70.)   With respect to \nthe opinion of Plaintiff \u2019s treating therapist, Kimberly Murtha, LPCMH, the ALJ explained that the \ndegree of limitation she endorsed was \u201c inconsistent  with the mental status examinations in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs .\u201d  (R. 7 1.)   \nWhile the ALJ did  not credit Plaintiff \u2019s allegations regarding the severity of her symptoms , \nhe did conclude that \u201csome limitations on the claimant \u2019s ability to perform wor k activities are \nwarranted .\u201d  (R. 69.)  To that end, he specified in the RFC determination that Plaintiff was limited \n\u201cto simple, routine, and repetitive work, but not at a production pace, . . . no more than incidental \nand infrequent contact with the gene ral public,\u201d  no \u201ctasks that would require her to work in tandem \nwith coworkers to complete job responsibilities,\u201d  and only environments  in which there is \u201cvery \nlittle change in work setting or work process.\u201d   (R. 67.)  The ALJ explain ed that those limitations \nwere  intended to take into account  Plaintiff\u2019s symptoms  of decreased energy and/or  low motivation  \n(among other  symptoms ).  (R. 69.)  Having reviewed the record, I agree with the Commissioner \nthat the ALJ \u2019s findings regarding Plaintiff\u2019s  symptoms  and the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination are both \nsupported by substantial evidence.    \n Plaintiff  also argues that her \u201cmedications side effects and risks operating machinery or \nanything related were not addressed. \u201d  (D.I. 1, Ex. 4. at 1.)   I disagre e.  The RFC adopted by the \nALJ says that Plaintiff  \u201ccannot be exposed to hazards, which is defined as climbing ropes, ladders, \nor scaffolds; using dangerous moving machinery; or being exposed to unprotected heights.\u201d   (R. \n67.)     9 \n B. New records  \nPlaintiff filed with this Court the additional evidence that she submitted to the Appeals \nCouncil .  (D.I. 3; R. 8 \u201348.)  I construe Plaintiff\u2019s filings as requesting a remand  for the ALJ to  \nconsider the additional evidence .  I agree with the Commissioner th at remand is not appropriate \nhere.   \nWhen the Appeals Council has considered additional evidence that was not before the ALJ \nand the Appeals Council has denied review of the ALJ \u2019s decision, the district court may remand \nthe case to the Commissioner \u201c only i f the evidence is new and material and if there was  good cause \nwhy it was not previously presented to the ALJ .\u201d  Matthews , 239 F.3d at 593.  New evidence is \nmaterial if there is a reasonable possibility  that it would have changed the outcome of the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision.  Szubak v. Sec \u2019y of Health & Hum. Servs., 745 F.2d 831, 833 (3d Cir. \n1984).   \nThe \u201cnew\u201d evidence submitted by Plaintiff  includes copies of a  Disability Benefits \nQuestionnaire and an addendum  completed by a psychologist as part of Plaintiff\u2019s  application for \nVA disability benefits.   (D.I. 3 at 4\u201313, 16\u201323.)   However, the ALJ already had records pertaining  \nto the VA \u2019s disability determination, including records that repeated some of the s ame opinions \nthe psychologist recorded in the questionnaire.  ( Compare [Veteran Evaluation Services] \nAddendum to Provider , D.I. 3 at 13 (summarizing the psychologist \u2019s findings with respect to \nPlaintiff\u2019 s functional impairments) with, e.g., Delaware Commission of Veteran Affairs Rating \nDecision , R. 230\u2013231 (copying verbatim the psychologist \u2019s findings  from the addendum ).)  Given \nthe similarity of the documents submitted to the Appeals Counsel to the evidence that was already \nbefore the ALJ , there is no reasonable possibility that the additional documents would have 10 \n changed the outcome of the decision (especially since the ALJ did not adopt the VA\u2019s disability \nfindings). \nThe remaining new documents are a letter from the Delaware Commission of V eterans \nAffairs,  an Exam Scheduling Request , treatment notes from Plaintiff\u2019s  podiatrist, and prescription \nrecords  that post -date the ALJ \u2019s decision.  (D.I. 3 at  2, 14\u201315, 24\u201341.)  Plaintiff  has not provided \nthe Court with any reason to believe that any of that  information is  material and /or non-cumulative \nto the information already before the ALJ .   \nC. Ineffective assistance of c ounsel  \nFinally, to the extent Plaintiff raises an ineffective assistance of counsel argument, that \nargument would fail, as there is no  constitutional right to counsel in Social Security proceedings .  \nMiller v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 719 F. App\u2019 x 130, 134 (3d Cir. 2017); see also  Cornett v. Astrue , \n261 F. App\u2019 x 644, 651 (5th Cir. 2008) (rejecting a social security claimant \u2019s ineffective assistance \nof counsel claim and noting that \u201c [t]he Supreme Court has never recognized a constitutional right \nto counsel in Social Security proceedings \u201d)). \nIV. CONCLUSIO N \nFor the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Plaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment \n(D.I. 22) be DENIED and the Commissioner \u2019s cross- motion (D.I. 23 ) be GRANTED.  \n This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
