The motions have been \nfully briefed (D.I. 195, 197, 206, 210, 220, 222) and I heard oral argument on select issues on \nJanuary 19, 2022 (D.I. 281). Following oral argument, I issued a Supplemental Order on Claim \nConstruction (D.I. 275), and the parties submitted letters of additional legal authority (D.I. 276, \n277) and additional briefing on the issues (D.I. 282, 286, 288). I have considered the parties' \narguments and briefing. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff First Quality (\"FQ\") brings this action alleging that Irving's accused bath tissue \nproduct infringes ten claims of three of FQ's patents: claims 1 and 3 of U.S. Patent No. 9,506,203 \n(\"the '203 patent\"), claims 1, 3, 4, and 8 of U.S. Patent No. 9,580,872 (\"the '872 patent\"), and \nclaims 4, 10, 12 and 13 of U.S. Patent No. 9,725,853 (\"the '853 patent\") (collectively, \"the \nAsserted Patents\" and \"the Asserted Claims\"). (D.I. 1 122; D.I. 197 at 1). The Asserted Patents \nshare essentially the same specification I and are directed toward novel \"through air dried\" tissues. \n(See D.l. 1-1, 1-2, 1-3). \nClaim 1 of the '203 patent discloses, \"A through air dried tissue comprising an outer surface \nhaving an Average Peak to Valley Waviness of 140 microns or less and a Waviness Uniformity of \n27 microns or less, the tissue having a bulk softness ofless than 10TS7.\" (D.I. 1-1 at 12). \nClaim 3 of the '203 patent is a dependent claim of claim 1, disclosing, \"A multi-ply sheet \ncomprising two or more plies, at least one of the two or more plies comprising the tissue of claim \n1.\" (Id.). \nThus, I cite only to one of them, the '203 patent's (hereinafter, \"the Specification\"). \n2 Claim 1 of the' 872 patent discloses , \"A through air dried tissue comprising an outer surface \nhaving an Average Peak to Valley Waviness of 140 microns or less, a Waviness Uniformity of27 \nmicrons or less, an Average Primary Amplitude of 50 microns or less and an Amplitude Uniformity \nof8micronsorless.\"(D.I. l-2at 11-12). \nClaim 3 of the '872 patent is a dependent claim of unasserted dependent claim 2, disclosing, \n\"The tissue of claim 2, further comprising an interior layer.\" (Id. at 12). Claim 2 of the '872 patent \nis a dependent claim of claim 1, disclosing , \"The tissue of claim 1, wherein the tissue includes first \nand second exterior layers.\" (Id.). \nClaim 4 of the '872 patent is a dependent claim of claim 1, disclosing, \"The tissue of claim \n1, wherein the tissue has a bulk softness ofless than 10TS7.\" (Id.). \nClaim 8 of the '872 patent is a dependent claim of claim 1, disclosing, \"A multi-ply sheet \ncomprising two or more plies, at least one of the two or more plies comprising the tissue of claim \nI.\" (Id.). \nClaim 4 of the '853 patent discloses , \"A through air dried tissue having a bulk softness of \nless than 10TS7 and comprising an outer surface having an Average Peak to Valley Waviness of \n140 microns or less.\" (D.1. 1-3 at 12). \nClaim 10 of the '853 patent is a dependent claim of unasserted independent claim 8, \ndisclosing, \"The two-ply, through air dried tissue of claim 8, wherein the outer surface has an \nAverage Peak to Valley Waviness of 135 microns or less.\" (Id.). Claim 8 of the '853 patent \ndiscloses: \n(Id.). A two-ply, through air dried tissue comprising an outer surface having an \nAverage Peak to Valley Waviness of 140 microns or less, a Waviness \nUniformity of 27 microns or less, an Average Primary Amplitude of 50 \nmicrons or less and an Amplitude Uniformity of 8 microns or less. \n3 Claim 12 of the '853 patent is a dependent claim of unasserted independent claim 8, \ndisclosing, \"The two-ply, through air dried tissue of claim 8, wherein the tissue has a softness of \nat least 90.\" (Id.). \nClaim 13 of the '853 patent is a dependent claim of unasserted independent claim 8, \ndisclosing, \"the two-ply, through air dried tissue of claim 8, wherein the tissue has a caliper of less \nthan 650 microns.\" (Id.). \nIrving seeks summary judgment \"that all asserted claims are invalid for indefiniteness, lack \nof written description , or both.\" (D.I 197 at 1). Irving also moves to exclude testimony from FQ's \ntechnical expert, Dr. Runge, and damages expert, Dr. Maness. (Id. at 2). \nFQ moves to exclude testimony from Irving's technical experts, Dr. Keller and Mr. \nKavalew, and damages expert, Mr. Malackowski. (D.I. 195 at 1). \nI issued claim constructions (D.I. 85, 275) for the following terms that are relevant to the \nissues before me now: \nTerm Construction \n\"Average Peak to Valley Waviness\" Average peak height plus average valley \ndepth (both taken as positive values) \nrelative to the meanline, as computed and \nmeasured according to the procedure of the \n'203 Patent at 9:31-57 [ and corresponding \ndisclosure of the other Asserted Patents l. \n\"Average Primary Amplitude\" Average distance between each roughness \nprofile point and the meanline , as \ncompared and measured according to the \nprocedure of the '203 Patent at 9:31-57 \n[ and corresponding disclosure of the other \nAsserted Patents l. \n\"an outer surface\" the surface of the outer side of the through \nair dried tissue \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \n4 A. Summary Judgment \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. Lamont \nv. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986)). \"[A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient \nto permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of \nevidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986). \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); \nWilliams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving \nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions , documents , electronically stored \ninformation , affidavits or declarations, stipulations ... , admissions , interrogatory answers, or other \nmaterials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish the \nabsence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(l). The non-moving party's evidence \n\"must amount to more than a scintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than \na preponderance.\" Williams, 891 F.2d at 461. \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the non-moving party \n5 fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has \nthe burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. See Celotex Corp., \n477 U.S. at 322. \nstates: B. Expert Testimony \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 sets out the requirements for expert witness testimony and \nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, \ntraining, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: \n(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will \nhelp the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in \nissue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; ( c) the testimony \nis the product of reliable principles and methods; and ( d) the expert has \nreliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case. \nFed. R. Evid. 702. \nThe Third Circuit has explained: \nRule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: \nqualification, reliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that \nthe witness possess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this \nrequirement liberally, holding that \"a broad range of knowledge, skills, and \ntraining qualify an expert.\" Secondly, the testimony must be reliable; it \n\"must be based on the 'methods and procedures of science' rather than on \n'subjective belief or unsupported speculation'; the expert must have 'good \ngrounds' for his o[r] her belief. In sum, Daubert holds that an inquiry into \nthe reliability of scientific evidence under Rule 702 requires a determination \nas to its scientific validity.\" Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert \ntestimony must fit the issues in the case. In other words, the expert's \ntestimony must be relevant for the purposes of the case and must assist the \ntrier of fact. The Supreme Court explained in Daubert that \"Rule 702' s \n'helpfulness' standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent \ninquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\" \nBy means of a so-called \"Daubert hearing,\" the district court acts as a \ngatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the \nrequirements of qualification , reliability and fit from reaching the jury. See \nDaubert (\"Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial \njudge must determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a) [of the Federal \nRules of Evidence] whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific \n6 knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a \nfact in issue.\"). \nSchneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, 320 F.3d 396, 404-05 (3d Cir. 2003) (cleaned \nup).2 \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Indefiniteness \n\"[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification \ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those \nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 \nU.S. 898, 901 (2014). Where \"different approaches to measurement are involved\" in the \nindefiniteness inquiry, \"the patent and prosecution history must disclose a single known approach \nor establish that, where multiple known approaches exist , a person having ordinary skill in the art \nwould know which approach to select.\" Dow Chem. Co. v. Nova Chems. Corp. (Can.), 803 F.3d \n620,630 (Fed. Cir. 2015). \nIndefiniteness is a question of law that may depend on subsidiary factual findings based on \nintrinsic evidence, i.e., \"the patent claims and specifications, along with the patent's prosecution \nhistory,\" and extrinsic evidence, \"for example, to understand the meaning of a term in the relevant \nart at the relevant time.\" Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 789 F.3d 1335, 1339-40 (Fed. \nCir. 2015). \"Regardless of whether a subsidiary factual finding plays a small or large role in the \nultimate conclusion about the meaning of the patent term, the ultimate question of construction \nwill remain a legal question.\" Id at 1340 (cleaned up). \"[D]efiniteness ... is amenable to resolution \n2 The Court wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent amendments to \nit were not intended to make any substantive change. \n7 by the jury where the issues are factual in nature.\" BJ Servs. Co. v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., \n338 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \nInvalidity must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut \nInt'!, 316 F.3d 1331, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Thus, \"[t]he burden of proving invalidity on summary \njudgment is high.\" Schumer v. Lab. Comput. Sys., 308 F.3d 1304, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \nEach of the Asserted Claims requires an Average Peak to Valley Waviness (\"W c\") of either \n\"140 or less\" or \"135 or less.\"3 I construed \"Average Peak to Valley Waviness \" to require \nmeasurement according to the procedures described in the Asserted Patents' Specification (\"the \nProtocol\"). (D.I. 85; D.I. 1-1 at 9:31-57). \nIrving argues the Asserted Claims are invalid for indefiniteness \"because there are multiple \nways to measure [the claimed surface characteristics], and the specification does not provide any \nguidance as to which way to use.\" (D.I. 197 at 10). Specifically, Irving argues the patents do not \ndescribe (1) \"where to perform the twenty scans required to measure We and Pa on embossed \ntissue,\" (2) \"how to account for embossing when measuring We and Pa,\" (3) \"how many samples \nto test, and (4) which software version to use for the required calculations,\" and that all of these \ndecisions \"can materially impact whether an embossed tissue satisfies the claims. \" (Id.). FQ argues \nIrving cannot carry its burden on indefiniteness because a POSA \"would understand that the \npatents describe one way, not multiple ways, to determine the claimed roughness parameters.\" \n(D.I. 210 at 4). \n3 Some of the Asserted Claims also require values for other surface roughness \ncharacteristics, including Waviness Uniformity, Average Primary Amplitude (\"Pa\"), and \nAmplitude Uniformity. Because We is the only surface roughness characteristic referenced by all \nthe Asserted Claims, the parties' indefiniteness arguments and my analysis focus on W c. \n8 I find that Irving has not met its burden of showing there are no genuine issues of material \nfact with respect to indefiniteness. For Irving to prevail on its theory of indefiniteness at the \nsummary judgment stage, it must show it is undisputed that \"there [are] competing existing \nmethodologies that reach[] different results, and the patent failed to describe which of the multiple \nmethods to use.\" Presidio Components, Inc. v. Am. Tech. Ceramics Corp., 875 F.3d 1369, 1377 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017). Irving has not done that, because whether a POSA would find there are \n\"competing existing methodologies\" on how to conduct the W c testing described in the Protocol \nis a disputed factual issue. Further, insofar as there may be multiple legitimate ways to approach \nsome aspects of the We testing, whether these \"competing methodologies\" reach different results \nis also a disputed factual issue. \nAs an initial matter, Irving's indefiniteness arguments relating to number of samples and \nsoftware version, arguments (3) and (4), respectively, are unconvincing. Irving's argument that the \nSpecification is ambiguous as to how many samples to test has no merit. For the reasons I \narticulated in my Supplemental Order on Claim Construction, the Protocol clearly contemplates \ntesting and averaging 200 total samples. (See D.I. 275 at 4-5). Irving's argument that a POSA \nwould not know which version of the OmniSurf software to use to conduct the testing also fails. \nDr. Runge and Dr. Brown state that a POSA would know to use the version of the software that \nwas current as of the filing date of the patent, which shows Irving's claim that a POSA would not \nknow which software version to use is factually disputed. (D.I. 199-1 Ex. 2, 462-64 (Runge) \n(information regarding the version of the software available at the time the patents were filed \"is \nreadily available, and a [POSA] would have sought out that information and used the same \nsoftware version used by First Quality in the patents.\"); D.I. 212-1 Ex. B, 27 (Brown) (a POSA \n\"would understand that they should use the same version of software as the inventors.\")). \n9 Irving's remaining indefiniteness arguments relate to (1) the Protocol's lack of guidance as \nto where the tissue should be scanned and (2) how a POSA should \"account for embossing\" during \ntesting. I find that, as to the first, it is factually disputed that a POSA would not know generally \nwhere the tissue should be scanned and, further, it is factually disputed that any variation in where \na POSA chooses to scan, so long as a POSA performs the scanning in an unbiased manner, would \nmaterially alter the results of the testing. As to the second, I find that it is factually disputed that a \nPOSA would not know \"how to account for embossing\" during testing and, further, it is factually \ndisputed that, so long as a POSA performs the scanning in an unbiased manner, the presence or \nabsence of embossing would materially alter the results of the testing. \n1. Location of Scanning \nIrving argues, \"the patents and their prosecution histories do not disclose (1) where to \nperform [the scans described in the Protocol], (2) whether the sample is physically moved between \nscans to test different lines, and, (3) if the sample is moved between scans, how to position those \nscans relative to each other,\" and that \"all of these choices can materially affect whether We, Pa, \nand their uniformities for a given tissue fall[] within the claims because the POSA can choose \nwhether to perform scans over embossing, not over embossing, or some combination thereof.\" \n(D.1. 197 at 13). \nWhile the Protocol does not expressly address these questions, I find that testimony from \nDr. Runge and Dr. Brown shows there is a factual dispute as to whether a POSA would \nnevertheless know the answers based on what is disclosed in the Protocol and standard industry \npractices. See Presidio, 875 F.3d at 1376 (\"Under our post-Nautilus cases, a claim is not indefinite \nif a person of skill in the art would know how to utilize a standard measurement method ... to \nmake the necessary measurement. A patent need not explicitly include information that is already \n10 well known in the art.\"). I also find that the experts' testimony regarding fundamental best \npractices for achieving non-biased results shows there is a factual dispute as to whether, due to \nembossing, a POSA' s decision about where to perform the scans would materially affect the results \nof the testing. \nI find that a factfinder could conclude based on the testimony of Dr. Runge and Dr. Brown \nthat a POSA would know (1) to test in a generally central area of the tissue, (2) to avoid scanning \nover the same line, and (3) to keep the positioning of the scans consistent from sample to sample. \nWith these assumptions in place, a factfinder could then conclude that the spacing between scans \nwould be immaterial to the outcome, because a POSA would know not to intentionally seek out or \navoid embossed areas, as doing so would bias the results. \nFirst, Irving's claim that a POSA would not know where to perform the scans described in \nthe Protocol is factually disputed. Dr. Runge explains in his report that a POSA would know to \nrun the tests \"in a generally common center region of the samples\" because \"when a bath tissue \nsheet ... is mounted on the Mahr test fixture approximately perf to perf, the center region of the \nsheet largely lines up with the test fixture's target region\" and a POSA \"would not be motivated \nto deviate from this general central region.\" (D.I. 199-2 ,r 18 (Runge)). Dr. Runge supports his \nopinion by explaining , \"A person of ordinary skill would [] understand a central region to be the \nmost sensible region to test because edge effects are mitigated in this region.\" (Id. at 20). \nDr. Runge's testimony is further supported by Dr. Brown's opinion, \"I understand from \nDr. Runge that testing of a center region of a sheet is standard in the tissue industry, which is also \nconsistent with general metrology practices.\" (D.I. 212-1 Ex. C ,r 14 (Brown)). Dr. Brown explains, \n\"Observations of a center region are less likely to include surface artifacts caused by outside \n11 influences ( e.g., effects near the edges of each sheet where the perforation or roll cutting may have \naltered the surface properties) .\" (Id.). \nSecond, Irving's claim that a POSA would not know whether the sample should be moved \nbetween scans to avoid scanning over the same line is factually disputed. Dr. Runge explains that, \nbecause \"the stylus tip of a contact profilometer will necessarily ... deform the tissue surface as it \nruns over the surface,\" \"it would be apparent to a skilled artisan that repeat testing over the same \nline should be avoided to achieve the aims of the testing described in the patents.\" (D.I. 213-1 Ex. \nB , 454 (Runge)). Dr. Brown agrees, \"Given the clear goal of the testing and the lack of any \ninstruction expressly stating to the contrary, the clear direction to the person of skill in the art \nwould be that the twenty scans should all be performed in the CD [ cross machine] direction over \ntwenty different traces.\" (D.I. 212-1 Ex. B, 25 (Brown)) . \n2. Accounting for Embossing \nIrving's claim that a POSA would not know what to do to \"account for\" embossing is \nfactually disputed. Dr. Runge and Dr. Brown's testimony suggest a POSA would understand that, \nbecause scanning should be performed \"in a generally consistent, center region of each tissue sheet \ntested,\" the precise spacing between scans is immaterial to the results and nothing special should \nbe done to \"account for\" embossing on tissues. (D.I. 212-1 Ex. C, 23 (Brown)). As Dr. Runge \nexplains, a POSA would \"recognize by default that the testing region should not be changed from \nsheet to sheet, as that would require modifying the test setup from sheet to sheet, which would, for \nexample, introduce potential error.\" (D.I. 199-1 Ex. 3, 20 (Runge)). Because a POSA would know \nthat the testing locations should remain consistent across samples, a POSA would understand that \nnothing should be done to \"account for\" embossing , because \"by testing a generally \nconsistent/common region throughout , the scans will cross embossment an appropriate proportion \n12 of time over 10 sheets, as a matter of course.\" (Id. at 19). Dr. Brown agrees, \"Over 10 tissue \nsamples, the amount of embossing that appears in such measurements regions will be appropriately \nrepresentative of the proportion of the tissue surface that has embossing. This is an unbiased, \nappropriate approach to understanding surface topographies .... \" (D.I. 212-1 Ex. C ,r 23 (Brown)). \nThe testimony of Dr. Runge and Dr. Brown shows that a factfinder could conclude that, so \nlong as a POSA uses \"a common, consistent region for scans across multiple samples,\" which \n\"avoids unintentional biasing of results,\" and neither intentionally seeks out nor avoids embossing , \nthe exact spacing between scans would not materially impact the outcome of the testing. (D.I. 212-\n1 Ex. C ,r 14). As Dr. Brown explains, \"The patents explain that two hundred 30 mm scans should \nbe performed across ten representative samples .... This generates a tremendous amount of data. \nIn my experience , and as would be understood by a [POSA], that sample size renders further \nguidance as to exactly where to perform the scans unnecessary .\" (D.I. 212-1 Ex. B. ,r22). \nIrving argues, \"Dr. Keller's unrebutted testing establishes that embossing can materially \naffect measurement of the claimed We and Pa values.\" (D.I. 197). Dr. Keller's \"unrebutted \" \ntesting, however, merely showed that scanning exclusively over embossed regions of the tissue \nproduces materially different results than scanning exclusively over non-embossed regions. (D.1. \n197 at 12; D.I. 198 ,r,r 45-46, 50 (Keller) (FQ's tissue met the claim limitations \"when the scans \ndid not run over embossing , whereas when the scans ran over embossing the values of the \nparameters did not fall within the claimed [ranges].\")). \nDr. Runge and Dr. Brown agree that a POSA would not interpret the Protocol to allow for \nscanning exclusively over embossed regions or exclusively over non-embossed regions , as doing \nso would bias the results. Dr. Runge states that scanning in a consistent region of the tissue \n\"without regard to embossment is the standard and most reasonable approach for a [POSA] to take \n13 because it is an unbiased approach -it takes the emboss pattern as it comes and it does not attempt \nto artificially bias the testing towards or away from emboss patterns.\" (D.I. 199-1 Ex. 3 if20). He \nfurther states that a POSA \"would not, as Dr. Keller does, specifically seek to conduct each and \nevery test on only embossments or only on non-embossed portions of the samples. Nor would the \n[POSA] otherwise seek to bias the results as Dr. Keller suggests through gerrymandered testing.\" \n(Id. ,r 445). Dr. Brown states, \"Dr. Keller's suggestion that a [POSA] would choose to perform all \nof the scans in a specific way so as to skew the representativeness of the data is antithetical to \nstandard scientific [principles] and, depending on the context, general [principles] of scientific \nhonesty and ethics.\" (D.I. 212-1 Ex. B ,r 23). Therefore, whether embossing materially affects a \ntissue's Pa and We measurements when a POSA does nothing to \"account for\" such embossing is \nfactually disputed. \nIrving cites to deposition testimony by Mr. Miller, Dr. Sealey, and Ms. Massey expressing \ndiffering opinions on whether embossments should be avoided during testing. (See D.I. 197 at 16). \nTheir testimony goes to the weight of FQ's argument, but it does not alter my conclusion that the \nquestion of whether a POSA would know, based on the Protocol and standard measurement \npractices, not to do anything to specially \"account for\" embossing is factually disputed. Because I \nfind that the experts' opinions and supporting reasoning are sufficient evidence such that a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that a POSA would know to test embossed tissue just as she \nwould non-embossed tissue, Irving has not met its burden of proving indefiniteness at the summary \njudgment stage. See Viva Healthcare Packaging USA Inc. v. CTL Packaging USA Inc., 197 F. \nSupp. 3d 837, 860 (W.D.N.C. 2016) (holding \"Defendants have failed to prove indefiniteness by \nclear and convincing evidence\" where there are outstanding factual questions \"as to what one \nskilled in the art would have understood by looking at the patent.\"). \n14 3. Conclusion \nFor these reasons, Irving's motion for summary judgment that the Asserted Claims are \ninvalid for indefiniteness is DENIED. \nB. Written Description \nThe written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 requires that a patent contain a \ndescription of the invention that \"clearly allow[ s] persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize \nthat the inventor invented what is claimed.\" Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 598 F.3d 1336, \n1351 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (cleaned up). \"[T]he test for sufficiency is whether the disclosure of the \napplication relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had \npossession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.\" Id. The written description inquiry \nis a question of fact. Thus, \"determining whether a patent complies with the written description \nrequirement will necessarily vary depending on the context. Specifically , the level of detail \nrequired to satisfy the written description requirement varies depending on the nature and scope of \nthe claims and on the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology.\" Id. (cleaned up). \n\"Compliance with the written description requirement . . . is amenable to summary \njudgment in cases where no reasonable fact finder could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\" \nPowerOasis, Inc. v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 522 F.3d 1299, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \"A party must \nprove invalidity for lack of written description by clear and convincing evidence. \" Vasudevan \nSoftware, Inc. v. MicroStrategy , Inc., 782 F.3d 671, 682 (Fed. Cir. 2015). \nIrving argues the Asserted Claims are invalid for lack of written description because (1) \nthe patents do not disclose any tissue having both the claimed We and Pa characteristics and the \nother claimed properties (D.I. 197 at 22-25), (2) the patents do not disclose tissues having We and \nPa values throughout the claimed broad ranges of We and Pa (id. at 25-26), and (3) the patents fail \n15 to disclose a tissue having W c and Pa in the claimed ranges based on an average of 200 samples, \nas required by the claims (D.I. 282 at 1-3). FQ responds that Irving's written description arguments \nare predicated on an incorrect understanding of what the law requires. (D.I. 210 at 18). \"The \nFederal Circuit has made clear that '[a] claim will not be invalidated on section 112 grounds simply \nbecause the embodiments of the specification do not contain examples explicitly covering the full \nscope of the claim language.\"' (Id. ( quoting LizardTech , Inc. v. Earth Res. Mapping , Inc., 424 F .3d \n1336, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2005))). \nFor the following reasons, I find Irving has not met its burden of showing there are no \ngenuine factual disputes material to the sufficiency of the Asserted Claims' written description. I \naddress each of Irving's arguments in turn. \n1. W c/Pa and Softness Properties \nIrving argues six4 of the Asserted Claims are invalid for lack of written description, because \nthey require a combination of W c and one of three other softness-related properties, but \"Example \n5 is the only disclosed example of a tissue having W c and Pa within the claimed ranges, and [] the \npatents do not disclose the bulk softness, hand-feel softness, or caliper of Example 5.\" (D .I. 197 at \n22). Thus, Irving argues, these claims are invalid because the Specification would not \"'clearly \nallow [a POSA] to recognize that [the inventors] invented what is claimed,' i.e., tissue having the \nclaimed combination of properties.\" (Id. at 22 (quoting Ariad, 598 F.3d at 1351)). FQ responds, \n4 Irving states, \"Six asserted claims require a combination of (a) We (and in many asserted \nclaims Pa) and (b) one of three other tissue properties.\" (D.I. 197 at 22). Irving, however, only \nspecifically identifies five claims (\"claims 1 and 3 of the '203 patent, claim 4 of the '872 patent, \nand claims 12 and 13 of the '853 patent\") that disclose softness properties in addition to We, and \nare therefore invalid. (Id.). I assume Irving intended to identify claim 4 of the '853 patent as well, \nwhich discloses, \"A through air dried tissue having a bulk softness of less than 10TS7 and \ncomprising an outer surface having an Average Peak to Valley Waviness of 140 microns or less.\" \n(D.I.1-3 at 12). \n16 \"that all claimed properties of the Example 5 tissue are not specifically disclosed [is] neither here \nnor there, under Ariad and other established law,\" because \"the specification, as a whole, does \ndisclose that the inventors possessed their invention.\" (D .I. 210 at 20). \nI agree with FQ that Ariad does not require disclosure of a specific example embodying all \nof the claim limitations. As Ariad itself expressly states, the Federal Circuit has \"made clear that \nthe written description requirement does not demand either examples or an actual reduction to \npractice .... \" Ariad, 598 F.3d at 1352. To satisfy the written description requirement, all that is \nrequired is a showing that a POSA would understand, based on what is disclosed within the four \ncomers of the specification, that the inventors were in possession of what they claimed. \nI find that Dr. Runge's testimony about what a POSA would understand from the \nSpecification's disclosures relating to the tissue's softness properties and surface profile properties \nis sufficient to show there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the adequacy of the Asserted \nPatents' written description. (See D.I. 213-1 Ex. B ,r,r 476-80). Dr. Runge explains that a POSA \nwould understand that the inventors were in possession of the claimed tissue based on the \nSpecification's detailed explanation of how the inventors achieved each of the claimed properties. \n(Id.). Dr. Runge notes that the Specification describes \"how to adjust various levers to adjust each \nof the claimed properties, \" \"describes in detail the impact of various softener/debonder \napplications to the disclosed examples [1-4],\" explains that two plies of the tissue of Example 1 \nwere combined to create Example 5, and discusses \"the relationship between the softness \nproperties discussed in examples 1-4 with the surface profile properties of example 5.\" (Id. ,r,r 478-\n79). \n17 A factfinder could reasonably conclude, based on Dr. Runge's testimony, that a POSA \nwould understand from the Specification that the inventor was in possession of a tissue with all of \nthe claimed properties. \n2. Ranges \nIrving argues the Asserted Claims are invalid for lack of written description because the \nwritten description does not support the broad ranges for the We and Pa values. The specification \nprovides 'just a single data point within each of the claimed ranges ... toward the upper end of the \nclaimed ranges,\" and, \"There is no description of a tissue having We or Pa, e.g., in the middle of \nthe claimed ranges, let alone toward their lower ends.\" (D.I. 197 at 25-26). FQ responds that Irving \nis wrong to \"focus on Example 5 in isolation, and eschew the rest of the patents' disclosure.\" (D.I. \n210 at 22). FQ points to Dr. Runge's testimony about \"how the inventors were able adjust various \naspects of the tissue making process to achieve a TAD tissue with characteristics throughout the \nclaimed range(s) for each\" to support its argument that \"the totality of the specification teaches the \nfull scope of the claims.\" (Id. at 23). \nI agree with FQ that Dr. Runge's testimony shows there is a genuine dispute of material \nfact as to whether the Asserted Patents' written description is sufficient. As the Federal Circuit \nexplained in Scripps: \nOpen-ended claims are not inherently improper; as for all claims their \nappropriateness depends on the particular facts of the invention, the \ndisclosure, and the prior art. They may be supported if there is an inherent, \nalbeit not precisely known, [lower] limit and the specification enables one \nof skill in the art to approach that limit. \nScripps Clinic & Research Found. v. Genentech, Inc., 927 F.2d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. \n1991), overruled on other grounds by Abbott Lab 'ys v. Sandoz, Inc., 566 F.3d 1282, \n1293 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"[P]rocess terms limit product-by-process claims. To the extent \n18 that Scripps Clinic is inconsistent with this rule, this court hereby expressly overrules \nScripps Clinic.\").5 \nHere, Dr. Runge's testimony shows both that the claimed W c and Pa ranges have an \ninherent lower limit and that the Specification would enable a POSA to approach that limit. Dr. \nRunge explains, \"No actual real world tissue surface has a Pa or We-or more colloquially, \n5 While Scripps was decided prior to the Federal Circuit's clarification in Ariad that written \ndescription and enablement are distinct requirements of\u00a7 112, Irving has not cited a single post\u00ad\nAriad example of a court invalidating a claim for lack of written description based on the claims' \ndisclosure of an open-ended range. \nLipocine does not help Irving. (See D.I. 277). There, the claims were directed to methods \nof administering a drug \"to obtain certain designated pharmacokinetic ('PK') results.\" Lipocine \nInc. v. Clarus Therapeutics, Inc., 541 F. Supp.3d 435,439 (D. Del. June 1, 2021). There, the Court \nfound the two \"Composition Examples\" in the specification, disclosing formulations containing \n15% and 18% API that satisfied the functional PK claims, were insufficient to show possession of \nformulations throughout the entire claimed API concentration range (14-35%) that would likewise \nsatisfy the functional PK claims. Id. at 458-59 (\"The Composition Examples that satisfy the \nlimitations of the [functional PK claims] are ... not representative of the entire claimed genus.\"). \nIn Lipocine, mere disclosure of how to achieve API concentrations throughout the claimed range \nwithout representative examples and accompanying PK results would have been insufficient to \nsatisfy the written description requirement because the claims also contained functional \nlimitations. Id. at 458 (\"[T]he species that are shown to be operative are not representative of the \nentire claimed genus.\") ( emphasis added). Here, by contrast, all the limitations of the Asserted \nClaims are structural -they describe surface and softness properties of a tissue -as opposed to \nfunctional. Thus, disclosure of examples spanning the entire claimed range of each property is \nunnecessary where the inventors have disclosed how to achieve values throughout the claimed \nrange of each property, as Dr. Runge testifies they have done here. \nEiselstein and Wertheim, the two other cases Irving cites in support of its \"range\" written \ndescription argument, are also inapt. (See D.I. 277). The Federal Circuit's conclusion in Eiselstein \nthat the Board did not clearly err in finding a grandparent application claiming 45-55% nickel \"did \nnot provide an adequate written description of the invention comprising 50-60% nickel\" is \nirrelevant. Eiselstein v. Frank, 52 F.3d 1035, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Here, the question is different, \nwhether an example near one end of a claimed range in combination with a description of how to \nachieve values throughout the claimed range can provide an adequate written description of that \nrange. Eiselstein's conclusion that an earlier claimed range does not show possession of a later\u00ad\nclaimed and different range does not help Irving. Wertheim, where the Court found that an earlier \nclaimed range of 25-60% solids content did not provide an adequate written description of a later \nclaimed range of \"at least 35%\" solids content, is inapposite for the same reason. Application of \nWertheim, 541 F.2d 257, 263-64 (C.C.P.A. 1976). \n19 \"smoothness\"-of zero microns. All real world surfaces, including tissue, have a practical lower \nlimit defining their smoothness which is certainly not zero microns.\" (D.I. 213-1 Ex. B ,r 473). \nMoreover, in Dr. Runge's opinion, \"contrary to Dr. Keller's assertion , the specification does \nindeed explain how to adjust various aspects of the tissue making process to achieve a TAD tissue \nover differing surface profiles less than the claimed upper limit(s) for each.\" (Id. ,r 471). Thus, a \nfactfinder could reasonably conclude from Dr. Runge's testimony that a POSA would understand \nthe inventors were in possession of tissue products with surface properties throughout the claimed \nranges. See Andersen Corp. v. Fiber Composite s, LLC, 474 F.3d 1361, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) \n(upholdingjury's verdict that patents were not invalid for lack of written description because \"jury \nwas free to credit\" testimony that \"a [POSA] would recognize\" claimed open-ended range had an \ninherent upper limit and a POSA \"would be fully enabled to practice the invention based on the \nspecification's disclosure\" \"in reaching its conclusion that the invention was adequately described \n... \" ). \n3. Number of Samples \nFinally, Irving argues that the Asserted Claims are invalid for lack of written description \nbecause the Specification's \"failure to disclose any tissue having We within the claimed range \n'obtained by averaging 200 scans from ten samples' confirms that there was no 'possession ' of \nany We based on 200 scans from 10 samples .... \" (D.I. 282 at 2). Irving's argument, however, \nimproperly relies on extrinsic evidence to show that the W c values reported in the Specification \nwere not derived from 200 samples. See id.; Ariad, 598 F.3d at 1351 (holding written description \n\"requires an objective inquiry into the four comers of the specification from the perspective of a \nperson of ordinary skill in the art\"). Lack of written description cannot be proven by the sort of \nextrinsic evidence Irving offers here. In any event, even if it were clear from the four comers of \n20 the Specification that the W c and Pa data disclosed in Example 5 was derived from fewer than 200 \nsamples, such a disclosure would still be sufficient to satisfy Ariad's baseline requirement of \"a \nconstructive reduction to practice that in a definite way identifies the claimed invention .... \" Id \nat 1352. \n4. Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, Irving's motion for summary judgment that the Asserted \nClaims are invalid for lack of written description is DENIED . \nC. Copying Opinions \nIrving argues Dr. Runge's and Dr. Maness's opinions that Irving copied FQ's products \nshould be excluded because (1) copying is a factual issue that is equally within the competence of \njurors to decide, (2) copying opinions improperly address Irving's \"intent, motive or state of \nmind,\" and (3) the copying opinions are not grounded in reliable scientific evidence \"because FQ's \nexperts perform no analysis to identify any specific way in which Irving allegedly copied \nsomething FQ had done.\" (D.I. 197 at 27-28). FQ responds that Dr. Runge's6 \"copying opinions\" \n\"are not chiefly about copying,\" but rather \"the main thrust of those opinions are 'on Irving's \npractices in developing its Sam's Club Member's Mark bath tissue.\"' (D.I. 210 at 27 (quoting D.I. \n213-1 Ex. A 176)). \nFirst, I agree with Irving that copying is a factual issue that is within the competence of the \njurors to decide. I disagree, however, with Irving's characterization of Dr. Runge's \"copying\" \ntestimony as \"not grounded in reliable scientific evidence.\" (D.I. 197 at 28). Indeed, it appears that \n6 Because Dr. Maness's copying opinions rely on Dr. Runge's opinions, I will focus my \nanalysis on Dr. Runge's opinions. (See D.I. 199-1 Ex. 13 1137, 43-44, 61 (Maness Op.); Ex. 14 \n1139-40 (Maness Reply)). It is hard to imagine that there would be any legitimate reason to have \nDr. Maness, an economist, rely upon or repeat any admissible \"copying\" testimony. \n21 some of the factual evidence on which a jury would rely in reaching such a conclusion would \nbenefit from an expert's explanation. For example, Dr. Runge relies on his expertise in the field of \ntissue research and development to opine on the significance of \"Irving's stated goal of matching \nFirst Quality's levels on temporary wet strength,\" as the level of temporary wet strength \"is a very \nspecific aspect of tissue production\" that \"will also have a significant impact on the properties of \nthe final product.\" (D.I. 199-1 Ex. 1 ,r 78). Dr. Runge also relies on his expertise to opine, \"Irving \n[] had a significantly inferior product as compared to First Quality's product\" in June 2014, and \nthe difference in softness between Irving and FQ's respective tissue products at that time was \n\"significant, and overcoming such a difference in softness would be a product development \nchallenge.\" (Id. ,r 79). \nSecond, the parties agree that expert opinions on intent, motive, or state of mind are \nimpermissible. FQ maintains, \"Dr. Runge does not intend to opine on [intent, motive, or state of \nmind] and First Quality agrees that no expert should be allowed to.\" (D.I. 210 at 30). The parties' \ndisagreement centers on whether individual excerpts from Dr. Runge's report are instances of \nexpert opinion on intent, motive, or state of mind, or simply repetitions of Irving's own \"stated \nintent\" from their internal documents. (Id. (\"[M]any of Irving's documents state an intent.\")). I \nagree with FQ that at least some of the excerpts it identifies contain improper opinions on intent, \nmotive, or state of mind. Nevertheless, these disputes are best resolved through objections at trial. \nI therefore decline to parse through Dr. Runge's report and rule individually (and without any \ncontext) on which opinions refer to intent and which do not. FQ is on notice oflrving's objections \n(and that there is merit to some of them) and would be well advised to limit the scope of Dr. \nRunge's testimony accordingly. \n22 For the above reasons, I agree with FQ that \"Dr. Runge's incidental and sporadic references \nto intent and 'copying' ... may be remedied without resorting to Irving's proposed wholesale \nexclusion of opinions.\" (Id. at 31). Therefore, I will DENY Irving's motion to exclude Dr. Runge's \n\"copying\" opinions with the following qualification. Neither Dr. Runge nor Dr. Maness may \ntestify at trial that Irving copied FQ. The parties are correct that this is a factual conclusion that is \nwithin the province of the jury to decide. Dr. Runge may, however, offer opinions on the limited \nset of underlying factual circumstances from which copying could be inferred and which require \nexpert explanation, including possibly industry standards for tissue product development and the \nsignificance of various individual tissue properties to the development process. FQ should err on \nthe side of caution in determining which portions of Dr. Runge's \"copying\" testimony to offer on \nthe basis that they \"provide technical and industry context for Irving's documents which would \nnot be apparent to a lay jury.\" (Id. at 28). \nD. Dr. Maness's Damages Opinion \nIrving argues Dr. Maness's damages opinion should be excluded, because he (1) does not \nexclude any non-infringing products from his royalty base; (2) improperly \"applies a rule of \nthumb\" in setting his proposed royalty rate to Irving's lowest annual profit margin for sales of its \naccused tissue; (3) \"effectively disgorges Irving's profits,\" despite not opining on lost profits; (4) \ndoes not apportion any value to unpatented features of the accused tissue; and (5) \"bases his \nreasonable royalty in part on his legally erroneous opinion that Irving's paper towel sales to Sam's \nClub are convoyed sales.\" (D.I. 197 at 31). I address each oflrving's arguments, some of which \nare frivolous, in turn. \n1. Non-infringing products \n23 Irving argues Dr. Maness's damages opinion should be excluded because his reasonable \nroyalty calculation does not account for a percentage of tissue product that would not literally \ninfringe the Asserted Claims, despite evidence that some of Irving's accused tissue \"has We and \nPa falling outside all asserted claims.\" (D.I. 197 at 32-33). FQ responds that Dr. Maness's \ncalculations are proper \"because, at a hypothetical negotiation, the parties' intent and expectation \nwould be for [all] sales to be infringing,\" and, \"to the extent there are any de minimis out-of-spec \nproducts that are non-infringing , sales of those products were only possible because of Irving's \ninfringement.\" (D.I. 210 at 31-32). \nFQ contends that any tissue product that satisfies Sam's Club's technical specifications \ninfringes the Asserted Claims. (See id. at 32-33). In other words, FQ argues that if any oflrving's \naccused product does not infringe, it is only because it is \"off-spec.\" (Id.; D .I. 213-1 Ex. A (Runge \nOpening Report) 160 (\"The only products I am aware of that satisfy Sam's Club's specifications \n... are products that practice the claims of the Asserted Patents.\") , Ex. C (Runge Reply Report) 1 \n43 (\"[T]he several individual, historical samples of Irving's Sam's Club Member's Mark bath \ntissue that were tested to be low quality for TS7 and TSA handfeel softness were clearly off\u00ad\nspec.\")). \nIrving replies, \"[T]here is no evidence of what fraction [of the accused tissue] indisputably \ndoes not infringe or that such product is 'out-of-spec. \"' (D.I. 220 at 17). Although FQ's position \nthat non-infringing tissue is also necessarily \"off-spec \" is factually disputed, I find that Dr. Runge \nhas a sound basis for this opinion and Dr. Maness' s reliance on such an assumption in his damages \ncalculation does not run afoul of Daubert. (See D.I. 213-1 Ex. C 1138-43 (\"Irving's documents \nshow that there have been a number of instances where Irving produced tissue below its \nspecification's targets and acceptance limits for TSA softness.\")). \n24 I agree with FQ that the law does not require a showing that \"damages in all circumstances \nbe limited to specific instances of infringement proven with direct evidence.\" (D.I. 210 at 33 \n(quoting Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009))). I find that \nat the hypothetical negotiation, the assumption of the parties would be that all the accused tissue \nwould have the same properties. (See D.I. 213-1 Ex. C ,r 40 (\"[O]ff-spec samples should not be \ndeterminative of the representative properties of a product, and generally would not be used in \nsuch a way in industry.\")). Thus, if the parties assume any of the tissue infringed, which would be \na given at the hypothetical negotiation, they would assume essentially all the tissue infringed. I \nfind Dr. Maness's opinion that even if some out-of-spec bath tissue did not literally infringe, \n\"neither party would desire the cost and nuisance of auditing every production batch sold to Sam's \nClub to determine if each roll was within the asserted claims\" to be sound. (D.I. 199-1 Ex. 14 ,r \n61). Therefore, Dr. Maness did not err in failing to account for off-spec non-infringing tissue in \nhis reasonable royalty calculation. \n2. \"Rule of Thumb\" \nIrving frivolously argues Dr. Maness impermissibly applied a \"rule of thumb\" by selecting \na proposed royalty rate equivalent to Irving's lowest annual profit margin on accused bathroom \ntissue sales. (D.I. 197 at 33). I disagree. \nThe Federal Circuit has rejected rules of thumb for \"being insufficiently grounded in the \nspecific facts of the case.\" Virnetx, Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 767 F.3d 1308, 1331-32 (Fed. Cir. \n2014). Here, I find that Dr. Maness appropriately tied his selected royalty rate to facts specific to \nthe case at hand. Dr. Maness explains the selected royalty rate is \"based on Irving's actual profit \nmargin from accused sales throughout the infringement period as well as the profits expected at \nthe time of the 2016 hypothetical negotiation,\" in addition to the \"bargaining power of the two \n25 parties given [] case-specific facts,\" such as the lack of a non-infringing alternative, and \"the reality \nthat Irving's cost of forgoing a license would be walking away from all the profit associated with \nthe Sam's Club opportunity .... \" (See, e.g., D.I. 199-1 Ex. 14 ,r,r 27). Therefore, Dr. Maness did \nnot rely on an impermissible \"rule of thumb\" in arriving at his selected royalty rate. \n3. \"Disgorgement\" \nIrving argues Dr. Maness's use of a royalty rate equivalent to Irving's lowest annual profit \nmargin is an improper attempt to \"reimburse FQ for lost profits by disgorging Irving's profits.\" \n(D.I. 197 at 35). This argument is frivolous too. \nFQ is correct when it says that Dr. Maness' s opinion does not identify and does not seek \nto recover FQ's lost profits. (D.I. 210 at 36). Nor does Dr. Maness's opinion seek to \"disgorge\" \nIrving of its profits. Dr. Maness merely, and appropriately, considers Irving's profits from sales of \nthe accused tissue, i.e., \"[t]he established profitability of the product made under the patent; its \ncommercial success; and its current popularity ,\" as one factor in determining a reasonable royalty \nrate. See Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. US Plywood Corp., 318 F. Supp. 1116, 1120 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). \nIrving's arguments relating to lost profits and disgorgement are baseless. \n4. Apportionment \nAmidst the dross, Irving has one golden nugget. \nIrving argues, \"By refusing to apportion any value to unpatented aspects of the accused \nbathroom tissue, Dr. Maness violated '[t]he essential requirement [] that the ultimate reasonable \nroyalty award must be based on the incremental value that the patented invention adds to the end \nproduct.\"' (D.I. 197 at 36 (quoting Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1226 (Fed. \nCir. 2014)). FQ responds, \"because bathroom tissue is not a multi component product, \napportionment, per se, is not actually required.\" (D.I. 210 at 37). FQ further argues that because \n26 \"the only way Irving was able to sell Member's Mark bath tissue was by matching First Quality's \npatent-practicing products,\" \"the Patents at Issue are the drivers of demand for the only customer \nwho bought the accused product [Sam's Club],\" and therefore it was appropriate for Dr. Maness \nto apportion 100% of the value of the accused products to the patented technology . (Id. at 37-38). \nI am not convinced by FQ's argument. \nFQ is incorrect that apportionment is not required because bathroom tissue is not a multi\u00ad\ncomponent product. The law on apportionment is clear. \"A patentee is only entitled to a reasonable \nroyalty attributable to the infringing features. The patentee must in every case give evidence \ntending to separate or apportion the defendant's profits and the patentee's damages between the \npatented feature and the unpatented features.\" Power Integrations , Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor \nInt'/ Inc., 904 F.3d 965,977 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nFQ's reliance on AstraZeneca is also inapt. There, the Court found the novel subcoating \n\"was substantially responsible for the value of the product\" because it made it commercially viable \nfor the first time; here, there is no dispute that bathroom tissue has long been commercially viable \nwithout FQ' s patented technology. AstraZeneca AB v. Apotex Corp., 782 F .3d 1324, 13 3 9-40 (Fed. \nCir. 2015). Irving's tissue product has both patented and unpatented features that contribute value \nto and drive demand for the product. Therefore , apportionment is required, and I agree with Irving \nthat \"100% apportionment is no apportionment at all.\" (D.I. 220 at 19). \nI implied at oral argument that I did not believe Dr. Maness properly apportioned in his \nreport and intended to strike any of his analysis that flowed from that failure. (D.I. 281 at 139:3-\n140:8). For the reasons stated above, I formally do that now by GRANTING Irving's motion to \nexclude the portions of Dr. Maness's original report that rely on his incorrect \"apportionment \" \nmethod. \n27 Dr. Maness has filed a supplemental expert report to address the apportionment issue. \nIrving has filed a brief (D.I. 295) objecting to the alternative method of apportionment Dr. Maness \n. employs in his supplemental report. I will treat Irving's renewed objection as a new motion and \naddress it separately. \n5. \"Convoyed Sales\" \nIrving argues, \"The final legal error requiring exclusion of Dr. Maness's damages opinion \nis that he treats Irving's paper towel sales to Sam's Club as convoyed sales in arriving at his \nproposed royalty,\" despite the paper towel sales not being \"convoyed sales as a matter of law \nbecause paper towels and the accused bathroom tissue undisputedly lack a functional \nrelationship.\" (D.I. 197 at 38). FQ responds that Dr. Maness does not use the paper towel sales in \neither his royalty base or royalty rate calculations and instead \"notes only that because the parties \nwould recognize that securing Sam's Club bath tissue business could help Irving secure its paper \ntowel business, Irving's maximum willingness to pay would have been even greater than its 12.6% \nprofit margin at the time of the hypothetical negotiation ... and, therefore, Dr. Maness's 7.5% \nrate is conservative.\" (D.I. 210 at 40). \nI find that, because Dr. Maness does not seek any lost profits for the paper towel sales, his \nconsideration of the paper towel sales as part of his overall damages opinion is appropriate. \nGeorgia-Pacific factor 6 expressly allows for the consideration of \"[t]he effect of selling the \npatented specialty in promoting sales of other products of the licensee; that existing value of the \ninvention to the licensor as a generator of sales of his non-patented items; and the extent of such \nderivative or convoyed sales.\" Georgia-Pacific, 318 F. Supp. at 1120. \n6. Conclusion \n28 For the reasons stated above, the portion of Irving's motion to exclude Dr. Maness's \ndamages opinion that I did not address at oral argument is DENIED. \nE. Dr. Keller's Opinions \nFQ seeks to exclude portions of Dr. Keller's opinions. Specifically, FQ argues Dr. Keller's \nproposed testimony (1) \"advocat[es] and us[es] an improper claim construction of 'an outer \nsurface,\"' (2) discusses \"optical\" and \"non-contact\" profilometry, \"which is irrelevant to this \ncase,\" and (3) includes \"rubber-stamping attorney argument, predicated on materials he admitted \nto never reviewing.\" (D.I. 195 at 1). I review each of these arguments in tum. \n1. \"Outer Surface\" \nFQ contends, \"Dr. Keller argues ... that the 'outer surface having' the claimed roughness \nparameters must be somehow either 'representative' of the entire outer surface of the tissue or be \nmore than a 'mere portion' of the entire outer surface.\" (Id. at 3). FQ argues that this amounts to \n\"a. new claim requirement\" which is \"improper because it is contrary both to the plain meaning of \nthe claims and the Court's constructions of 'Average Primary Amplitude' and 'Average Peak to \nValley Waviness.\"' (Id.). For the reasons explained in my Supplemental Order on Claim \nConstruction (D.I. 275), I disagree. \nI construed \"an outer surface\" to mean \"the surface of the outer side of the through air dried \ntissue,\" explaining, \"when the inventors discuss improvements to the tissue's 'surface profile,' \nthey are referring to the surface profile of the tissue as a whole.\" (Id. at 2-3). The portions of Dr. \nKeller's opinions to which FQ objects, where he opines that infringement testing should be \nconducted to generate measurements that \"are representative of the outer surface\" and \"not a mere \nportion of that outer surface\" are compatible with this construction of\"an outer surface.\" (D.I. 195 \nat 5-6; see, e.g., D.I. 200-1 ,r 36 (Keller Rebuttal) (\"[T]he 'outer surface' that is claimed is not a \n29 mere portion of that outer surface\") ; Id. ,r 40 (POSA would understand FQ's testing \"is not \nrepresentative of the outer surface.\")). \nFor these reasons, FQ's motion to exclude Dr. Keller's opinions on the claimed \"outer \nsurface\" is DENIED. \n2. Optical Profilometry \nFQ moves to exclude Dr. Keller's discussion of \"optical\" or \"non-contact\" profilometry \nbecause it is \"both entirely irrelevant to the case and highly likely to confuse the trier of fact.\" (D.I. \n195 at 12). FQ argues that, because the Asserted Claims require that We and Pa be measured using \ncontact profilometry , Dr. Keller's \"confounding discussion of non-contact , optical profilometry \nmethods and the respective benefits of optical profilometry over contact profilometry throughout \nhis reports is an impermissible end run around the Court's claim construction .\" (Id.). Irving \nresponds that Dr. Keller's comparison of contact profilometry to non-contact profilometry is \nrelevant to damages, specifically '\"the nature of the invention ' and its relative lack of 'utility,' \nwhich are 'important considerations in the hypothetical negotiation.\" ' (D.I. 206 at 15 (quoting \nCarnegie Mellon Univ. v. Marvell Tech. Grp., Ltd., 807 F.3d 1283, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2015))). Irving \nfurther argues that FQ's framing of Dr. Keller's opinions as \"an impermissible end run around the \nCourt's claim construction \" is incorrect , because Dr. Keller relies solely on contact profilometry \nmeasurements to opine on non-infringement. (D.I. 206 at 15). \nBecause I agree with Irving that (1) Dr. Keller has not relied on non-contact profilometry \nto opine on whether the accused product meets the claim limitations (D.I. 200-1 (Keller Rebuttal) \n,r,r 44-48; D.I. 200-2 (Keller Reply) ,r,r 104-06), (2) Dr. Keller's discussion of the deficiencies of \nthe contact profilometry technique required by the claims may be relevant to damages (D.I. 200-\n17 at 22, 48), and (3) Dr. Keller's non-contact profilometry images may help the jury visualize \n30 what embossing and the surface characteristics that are the subject of the claim limitations look \nlike at the micron scale (D.I. 200-6 11 79-83), I do not see a reason to exclude Dr. Keller's \ntestimony relating to optical profilometry at this time. FQ's motion to exclude Dr. Keller's \ntestimony relating to optical profilometry is DENIED without prejudice to objections at trial based \non the rules of evidence. \n3. Dr. Keller's Other Opinions \nFQ argues that Dr. Keller's remaining opinions are \"attorney argument, created and written \nby Irving's lawyers, and merely rubber-stamped by Dr. Keller sight-unseen\" and should therefore \nbe excluded because \"they are not predicated on reliable scientific investigation .... \" (D.I. 195 at \n16-17). FQ points to (1) Dr. Keller's admission in his deposition that \"he reviewed , at most, only \nisolated lines identified by Irving's attorneys and no other portion of' transcripts from certain fact \nwitnesses ' depositions that he cited in his report (id. at 18; D.I. 200-7 (Keller Opening) 1176, 117, \n118, 132, 135, 136, 165, 178); (2) paragraph 132 of Dr. Keller's opening report discussing various \nfact witnesses ' testimony on how contact profilometry scans should be spaced relative to each \nother, portions of which appear verbatim in a motion filed by Irving in October 2020, before Dr. \nKeller had access to the cited materials (D.I. 195 at 18-19; D.I. 200-71 132; D.I. 200-9 at 2); and \n(3) Dr. Keller's \"extensive[] \" reliance on Mr. Kavalew 's contemporaneously filed report, despite \nadmitting at his deposition that he had not seen Mr. Kavalew's report prior to submitting his own \nreport (D.I. 195 at 20). \nIrving responds, \"FQ's rhetoric ignores that Dr. Keller's opinions are well-supported by \ntechnical evidence and that he had very substantial involvement in his reports.\" Irving points to \nDr. Keller's response to Irving's questioning about whether there were portions of his report he \ndid not write: \"The technical component is entirely mine. My findings are mine. I wrote those. \n31 And the legal team I'm working with typed out the table of contents, inserted the patent('s claims].\" \n(D.I. 206 at 18; D.I. 200-8 at 166:3-167 :4). \nI agree with Irving that the deficiencies identified by FQ in Dr. Keller's reports are not \nserious enough to require blanket exclusion of Dr. Keller's opinions. In re Asbestos Products \nLiability Litigation (no. VI), 714 F. Supp. 2d 535, 542 (E.D. Pa. May 24, 2010) (\"When a Rule \n26(a)(2)(B) challenge is raised, the proper focus of the court's inquiry is whether the expert witness \noffered substantial input into what was put into the report.\") ( cleaned up). The examples FQ points \nto involve subjects that are ancillary to Dr. Keller's primary invalidity and non-infringement \nopinions. Irving has shown that Dr. Keller had \"substantial involvement \" in what was included in \nhis reports and was responsible for the reports' technical analyses and conclusions, which comprise \nthe core of his testimony . (See, e.g., D.I. 206 at 19 (citing evidence from the record to show \"Dr. \nKeller's opinions are well-supported by technical evidence, including technical literature , patents, \ntissue images, testing, and measurements that the parties produced.\")). \nFQ's concerns with Dr. Keller's report can be fairly addressed through cross-examination . \nFor these reasons, FQ's motion to exclude Dr. Keller's opinions is DENIED. \nF. Mr. Kavalew's Opinions \nAs I implied at oral argument (D.I. 281 at 105:22-106:3) , I do not think there are any \nDaubert issues with Mr. Kavalew 's opinions. \nIrving relies on physical samples of tissues manufactured before the priority date of the \nAsserted Claims as prior art in its invalidity case. Irving's technical expert, Mr. Kavalew , \nperformed testing on these prior art tissue samples to show they met the requirements of the \nAsserted Claims. FQ argues this testing by Mr. Kavalew should be excluded for three reasons: (1) \n\"Irving's present-day test results on the physical samples do not reliably reflect the properties of \n32 the tissue at the time they were prior art,\" (2) \"Mr. Kavalew relies on testing and evaluation on the \nalleged prior art samples performed by Irving employee Ida Lamanna , but during fact discovery \nIrving asserted privilege over Ms. Lamanna's evaluation of those very same samples,\" and (3) \n\"[M]any of the test results are inherently unreliable because Mr. Kavalew is unable to confirm the \ncorrectness or accuracy of them,\" \"many of the measurements were inconsistently reported in Mr. \nKavalew's report,\" and, \"While Irving served a 'corrected' report from its attorneys after the close \nof expert discovery, there is no basis for the 'corrections.'\" (D.I. 195 at 21 ). I am not persuaded by \nany ofFQ's arguments. \nFirst, I find that the question of whether the prior art samples had the same properties at \nthe time of testing as they had prior to the priority date is a factual question on which both parties \nshould be allowed to opine. Mr. Kavalew testified that the packaging was unopened prior to testing, \nhad no expiration or \"use by\" dates, and that he personally inspected the samples and found they \nshowed no signs of degradation. (D.I. 207-1 Ex. 20 ,r,r 145, 146,187,206,225; D.I. 200-5 ,r,r 32-\n33). Mr. Kavalew also tested two properties of the tissues, caliper and tensile, that would have \nbeen likely to change over time if degradation had occurred and found both were within the target \nrange for all samples. (D.I. 200-5 ,r,r 85-89, 104-09, 160-65, 178-83, 284-89, 294-99, 345-50, 354-\n50, 354-57). \nSecond, as to the argument that FQ suffered some prejudice from its inability to depose \nMs. Lamanna prior to Irving waiving its work product privilege, I resolved that at oral argument. \n(D.I. 281 at 134:7-139:2). \nFinally, the errors in Mr. Kavalew's original report were typographical and have been \ncorrected. FQ is in possession of all the data from the testing and is free to cross examine Mr. \nKavalew about that data and any remaining inconsistencies in his results at trial. \n33 For these reasons, FQ's motion to exclude Mr. Kavalew's testimony about the results of \nhis testing on the prior art tissues is DENIED . \nG. Mr. Malackowski's Opinions \n1. P&G Settlement Agreement \nThe Federal Circuit has \"recognized that licenses may be presented to the jury to help the \njury decide an appropriate royalty award.\" Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1227 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014). \"[T]here must be a basis in fact to associate the royalty rates used in prior licenses \nto the particular hypothetical negotiation at issue.\" Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 632 F.3d \n1292, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Because licenses \"are almost never perfectly analogous to the \ninfringement action,\" reasonable royalty opinions \"relying on licenses must account for [] \ndistinguishing facts when invoking them to value the patented invention.\" Ericsson, 773 F.3d at \n1227. \"[C]omparisons of past patent licenses to the infringement must account for the \ntechnological and economic differences between them.\" Wordtech Sys., Inc. v. Integrated \nNetworks Sol'ns, Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (cleaned up). \nWhile the Federal Circuit \"has often excluded licenses that are technologically or \neconomically non-comparable ,\" it \"has also held, however, that the issue of comparability is often \none of sufficiency of the evidence , not admissibility .\" Bio-Rad Lab ys, Inc. v. JOX Genomics Inc., \n967 F.3d 1353, 1373-74 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Nevertheless, \"a patentee [can] not rely on license \nagreements that [are] radically different from the hypothetical agreement under consideration to \ndetermine a reasonable royalty.\" Uniloc, 632 F.3d at 1316 (cleaned up). \nFQ seeks to exclude Mr. Malackowski 's opinions relying on a \"Settlement and Patent \nLicense Agreement \" entered into between Proctor & Gamble and Irving (the \"P&G-Irving \nAgreement \") in March 2012. FQ argues, \"Neither Irving nor Mr. Malackowski have come close \n34 to showing that the [P&G-lrving Agreement] is comparable to the hypothetical license because \nneither Irving nor Mr. Malackowski have identified even the most rudimentary facts necessary to \nevaluate comparability of the [P&G-lrving Agreement].\" (D.I. 195 at 27-28). FQ argues the \n\"unknowns regarding that agreement include at least the following\": (1) \"What dispute the \nsettlement resolved,\" (2) \"what Irving product(s) the settlement covered,\" (3) \"how many sales or \nhow much revenue Irving made or expected to make from the licensed product,\" (4) \"whether \nIrving ever actually used or intended to use the licensed technology in any product,\" (5) \"whether \nthe licensed technology is capable of being used in bathroom tissue products,\" and (6) \"any \nidentification whatsoever of the circumstances that led to the settlement.\" (Id. at 28). Irving \nresponds, \"Mr. Malackowski at least has shown 'baseline comparability' to support admissibility, \nand FQ's challenge to 'the degree of comparability is a factual issue best addressed through cross \nexamination.\"' (D.1. 206 at 32 (quoting Bio-Rad, 967 F.3d at 1373-74)). \nThe P&G-lrving Agreement resolved two disputes, one relating to Irving's diaper products \n(the \"Diaper Dispute\"), and one relating to Irving's tissue products (the \"Tissue Dispute\"). (D.I. \n200-17 at 40). Mr. Malackowski notes, \"the disputes between the parties were 'amicably resolved' \nwithout any lawsuit being filed in court.\" (Id.). The Diaper Dispute arose from a disagreement \nover royalty obligations due under a previous patent license agreement from 2003 (the \"2003 \nDiaper License\"). (Id. at 40-41). The P&G-lrving Agreement included a \"release,\" under which \nthe parties agreed that no further payments would be required under the 2003 Diaper License. (Id. \nat 41 ). \nThe P&G-lrving Agreement granted Irving \"a fully paid up, irrevocable, royalty-free, and \nworldwide license for all past manufacture, use, offering for sale, sale, or importation of any \nproducts within the claims of the licensed tissue patents.\" (Id. at 41 ). Mr. Malackowski opines, \n35 \"With respect to the licensed products, the P&G-Irving Agreement can cover both (bathroom \ntissue] and paper towels.\" (Id. at 43). Neither Mr. Malackowski nor Irvine, however, has identified \nany specific Irving product covered by the Agreement. Accordingly, the amount of revenue Irving \nhas made or expected to make from the licensed technology is unknown. \nMr. Malackowski performed an in-depth assessment of the comparability of the P&G\u00ad\nIrving Agreement to the hypothetical negotiation. He begins by comparing the timing, noting the \nAgreement occurred \"approximately 4.5 years prior to the hypothetical negotiation in November \n2016,\" but that there were \"no notable differences in the bath tissue market during this period as \nthe market was stable, growing at a rate of less than 1 % per year.\" (Id. at 41 ). Mr. Malackowski \nthen compares the relationships between the respective parties, noting \"the competitive \nrelationship between the licensor and licensees in [the] P&G-Irving Agreement is sufficiently \nsimilar to the relationship of the hypothetical negotiators ,\" because, although P&G and Irving \nwould not compete \"at the retailer level for private label (bathroom tissue] supplier status,\" they \nwould \"still compete with each other at the consumer level.\" (Id. at 41 ). \nMr. Malackowski then turns to comparing the licensed technologies , noting the P&G\u00ad\nIrving Agreement \"included rights to nine patents and patent applications ,\" including four issued \nU.S. patents. (Id.). He summarizes the technology claimed in the four issued patents, and relies on \ndiscussions with Mr. Kavalew, one of Irving's technical experts , to conclude , \"the licensed P&G \npatents are similar to the asserted patents in that they both disclose certain parameters relating to \ntissues.\" (Id. at 41-42). In comparing the licensed technologies , Mr. Malackowski notes, \"the \ntesting and parameters contained in the licensed P&G patents are measurements that are commonly \nassessed in the industry in contrast to the Patents-in-Suit which disclose uncommon testing \nprotocols and parameters ,\" and the licensed P&G patents disclose properties such as \"enhanced \n36 softness without sacrificing strength, bulk, and/or absorbency \" and \"improved absorbency ,\" as \nopposed to the Asserted Patents which \"cover a totally flat sheet of tissue with a zero Average \nPeak to Valley Waviness, Primary Amplitude , and uniformity values.\" (Id. at 42). For these \nreasons, Mr. Malackowski concludes , \"Given the above , Mr. Kavalew noted that the P&G licensed \npatents are relatively more valuable than the Patents-in-Suit ,\" and therefore, \"All else being equal, \nthis would indicate that the reasonable royalty from the hypothetical negotiations would be lower \nthan the royalty rate agreed to in the P&G-Irving Agreement.\" (Id. at 42-43). \nMr. Malackowski notes that because \"Irving also received a release regarding certain P&G \npatents related to Irving's diaper products,\" \"the reasonable royalty from the hypothetical \nnegotiations would be lower than the royalty agreed to in the P&G-Irving Agreement.\" (Id. at 43). \nHe concludes , \"the licensed products under the P&G-Irving Agreement and the \nhypothetical negotiations are sufficiently comparable ,\" because \"the P&G-Irving Agreement can \ncover both [bathroom tissue] and paper towels.\" (Id.). Finally, Mr. Malackowski compares the \nterms of the P&G-Irving Agreement and the hypothetical license, finding they both would be \n\"long-term license[ s ]\" which \"would indicate a similar royalty rate in this matter.\" (Id.). \nI find that Mr. Malackowski has made a sufficient showing of the technological \ncomparability of the P&G-Irving Agreement to the hypothetical negotiation. I also find that Mr. \nMalackowski's analysis of the parties' competitive relationships and the relative value of the \ninventions disclosed in the licensed patents as compared to the Asserted Patents is sufficient to \nmake a showing of the \"baseline [economic] comparability\" required by the Federal Circuit. See \nBio-Rad, 967 F.3d at 1373-74. \nThe thoroughness of Mr. Malackowski 's comparability analysis far exceeds the \"loose, \nvague allegations of technological comparability \" that led to the exclusion of the damages expert's \n37 opinion in M2M Sol'ns LLC v. Enfora, Inc., 167 F. Supp. 3d 665, 677-78 (D. Del. 2016). \nAdditionally, unlike in M2M, id. at 678, where the damages expert \"virtually ignore[ d] the fact \nthat [the] two licenses resulted from litigation settlements, providing a drastically different \nbackdrop than the hypothetical negotiation involving two willing licensors,\" here, Mr. \nMalackowski expressly notes that no lawsuits were filed in the disputes giving rise to the P&G\u00ad\nIrving Agreement. (D.I. 200-17 at 40). \nThe other two cases FQ relies on in its argument for exclusion, Plexxikon and Sprint, are \nsimilarly inapt. In Plexxikon, the defendant failed to show \"that the technology [was] comparable\" \nand the Court took issue with \"the litigation-focused circumstances of the negotiations of the \nlicenses.\" Plexxikon Inc. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 2021 WL 97544, at *7 (N.D. Ca. Jan. 12, \n2021). Here, the P&G-Irving Agreement did not arise out of litigation and Mr. Malackowski has \nmade a sufficient showing of technological comparability. In Sprint, the licenses were excluded \n\"most importantly\" because \"three out of the four licenses resulted from litigation settlements with \nnon-practicing entities, who most likely were in drastically different bargaining positions than \nSprint would have been in at the time of the hypothetical negotiation.\" Sprint Commc 'ns Co. v. \nComcast IP Holdings, LLC, 2015 WL 456154, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 30, 2015). By contrast, the P&G\u00ad\nIrving Agreement did not involve a non-practicing entity, and Mr. Malackowski expressly noted \nthe similarities and differences between the competitive relationships of the respective parties in \nthat Agreement and the present hypothetical negotiation . Finally, unlike in Sprint, where the \nlicenses were \"not sufficiently comparable to the hypothetical licenses\" and \"to the extent the lack \nof comparability could be accounted for, [the expert did] not attempt[] to do so,\" here, Mr. \nMalackowski has performed a sufficient comparability analysis. \n38 While the lack of information about the specific products covered by the agreement and \nIrving's actual or expected revenues from those products is a deficiency in Irving's showing of \neconomic comparability, I find that these omissions go to the weight of Mr. Malackowski's \nopinion and can be sufficiently addressed through cross-examination . Thus, I find they are not \nsevere enough deficiencies to require exclusion, especially as \"the degree of comparability of the \nlicense agreements is a factual issue best addressed by cross examination and not by exclusion .\" \nBio-Rad, 967 F.3d at 1374. \nFor these reasons, FQ's motion to exclude Mr. Malackowski's discussion of the P&G\u00ad\nIrving Agreement is DENIED . \n2. GP-Irving Embossing License \nMr. Malackowski also relies on a license agreement (the \"GP Emboss License\") entered \ninto between Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP (\"GP\") and Irving, in which GP licensed \nIrving a non-exclusive, limited license to an embossing pattern used on Irving's accused product. \n(D.I. 200-17 at 43). FQ argues this portion of Mr. Malackowski's opinion should be excluded, as \n\"[t]he GP Emboss License is not even a patent license. It is a license only to a particular pattern.\" \n(D.I. 195 at 34). I agree. A license to an embossing pattern has effectively no bearing on the value \nof the Asserted Patents, which claim physical properties of a tissue product. \nMr. Malackowski's argument that the \"the value of the Patents-in-Suit ... can be correlated \nto the value of utilizing certain embossing patterns,\" because \"whether a tissue falls within the \nscope of the asserted claims may depend on the embossing pattern used\" is unpersuasive . (D.I. \n200-17 at 45). While whether a tissue falls within the scope of the Asserted Claims may depend \non the percentage of the tissue surface that is covered by embossment (although even that is \n39 disputed), the purely aesthetic formation of the embossment , which is the \"technology\" covered \nby the GP Emboss License, is entirely unrelated to the technology covered by the Asserted Patents. \nFQ's motion to exclude Mr. Malackowski's testimony relating to the GP Emboss License \nis GRANTED . \n3. Non-Infringing Alternative \nFQ argues that Mr. Malackowski's opinion \"that Irving could have avoided infringement \nby using a denser embossing pattern on its Member's Mark bathroom tissue and, therefore, that \nthe maximum amount Irving would agree to pay at a hypothetical negotiation is the cost of \nchanging that embossing pattern\" should be excluded because \"there are no facts from which a \njury could reasonably conclude that Mr. Malackowski 's proposed [non-infringing] alternative \nwould be acceptable. \" (D.I. 195 at 35). Irving responds that it \"will be able to present ample \nevidence from which a jury could conclude that the non-infringing alternative -bathroom tissue \nwith a denser emboss pattern-would have been acceptable to Sam's Club.\" (D.I. 206 at 36). \nI agree with Irving that whether a denser embossing pattern would have been acceptable to \nSam's Club is a factually contested point, and therefore decline to decide this factual issue in FQ's \nfavor before trial. Irving points to evidence that (1) unrebutted testing shows Irving's bathroom \ntissue made using the same base sheet and a denser emboss pattern that it supplies to Wegmans , a \ndifferent tissue seller, does not infringe (D.I. 200-1 ,r,r 90-95), (2) unrebutted testing shows other \ncommercially available bathroom tissue products with denser emboss patterns do not infringe (id. \n,r,r 96-104), and (3) Sam's Club selected a different emboss pattern for the paper towels Irving \nsupplies to Sam's Club than the emboss pattern for the paper towels FQ supplies to Sam's Club. \n(D.I. 200-17 at 39-40). \n40 I find that this evidence belies FQ' s claim that \"there are no facts from which a jury could \nreasonably conclude \" Sam's Club would find Mr. Malackowski 's non-infringing alternative \nacceptable. For these reasons, FQ's motion to exclude Mr. Malackowski 's testimony relating to a \nnon-infringing alternative is DENIED . \nIV.
