(D.I. 142)! For the following reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude is GRANTED.\nll. BACKGROUND\na. Procedural History\nPlaintiffs initiated this action on January 8, 2019, when they filed the original complaint\nagainst Ryan Gilbertson (\u201cMr. Gilbertson\u201d), RRG Family Capital LLC, Ryan Gilbertson Family\n2012 Irrevocable Trust, and Total Depth Foundation, Inc. (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), asserting\nsecurities fraud, common law fraud, and breach of contract claims, and seeking a declaratory\njudgment and interpleader, all arising from an Equity Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d)\n\nthe parties entered on October 17, 2018. (D.I. 1) Before any defendant filed a responsive\n\n1 The briefing for the pending motion is as follows: Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief (D.I. 143),\nDefendants\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 180), and Plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief (D_I. 190).\npleading, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (the \u201cFAC\u201d) on April 8, 2019, realleging\nthe same causes of action as the original complaint and adding the United States of America as a\ndefendant.? (D.I. 3)\n\nOn September 29, 2020, Defendants filed a partial motion for judgment on the pleadings\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), seeking dismissal of the securities fraud and common law fraud\nclaims. (D.I. 58) Shortly after briefing was completed, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file\na Second Amended Complaint (the \u201cSAC\u201d). (D.I. 85) Therefore, the court denied as moot\nDefendants\u2019 motion for partial judgment on the pleadings. (D.I. 109; D.I. 133) On April 13,\n2021, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint (the \u201cSAC\u201d), providing additional facts to\nsupport their existing claims, as well as requests for punitive and rescissory damages. (D.I. 111)\n\nOn May 21, 2021, Plaintiffs served on Defendants the opening expert reports of Dr.\nTimothy Nantell (\u201cDr. Nantell\u201d), Shane Dore (\u201cMr. Dore\u201d), and Seth Fliegler. (D.I. 126) On\nJuly 16, 2021, Defendants served on Plaintiffs the rebuttal expert report of Mr. Brown. (D.I.\n127) On August 12, 2021, Plaintiffs served on Defendants the reply expert reports of Dr. Nantell\nand Mr. Dore. (D.I. 131) On September 17, 2021, the parties filed cross-motions for partial\nsummary judgment. (D.I. 135; D.I. 148) Plaintiffs also filed this Daubert motion to exclude Mr.\nBrown\u2019s expert opinions. (D.I. 142)\n\nb. Facts\n\nThis action involves allegations of breach of contract and fraud arising from the parties\u2019\n\nOctober 17, 2018 Equity Purchase Agreement. (D.I. 111) Plaintiffs purchased Defendants\u2019\n\nequity interest in Northern Capital Partners I, LP; Northern Capital Partners I, GP, LLC;\n\n2 The United States of America was dismissed with prejudice from the case on December 2,\n2019, pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal. (D.I. 31)\n\n2\nNorthern Capital Group LLC; NI Sand Holding, LLC; and NIS Investment Holding, LLC\n(collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d). (Jd. at { 2, 4-5) The parties agreed upon a purchase price of\n$11.1 million. (D.I. 156, Ex. A at 2-3; D.I. 160, Ex. AM at 25; D.I. 143 at 4) To establish the\npurchase price for the transaction, Plaintiffs used an EBITDA? Multiple Framework as follows:\nShortly after the Agreement was executed, Plaintiffs claim that they purchased the equity\nat \u201ca grossly inflated price\u201d due to Defendants\u2019 numerous material misrepresentations about the\nCompany. (D.I. 156 at J 4-5; D.I. 111 at J] 6, 42, 60) Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that\nDefendants overstated inventory, omitted employee bonuses and salary increases, understated\nliabilities, and misrepresented the collectability of accounts receivable. (D.I. 143 at 4-5)\nPlaintiffs also claim that they discovered six undisclosed, material contracts that subjected the\nCompany to monthly minimum payments, penalties for shortfalls, future commitments, and other\nfees and obligations. (/d.) Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs suffered no damages or,\nalternatively, that any alleged inflation of the purchase price calculation resulted from Plaintiffs\u2019\nlack of due diligence and use of the nonstandard EBITDA Multiple Framework. (D.I. 180 at 10-\n12)\nIll. LEGAL STANDARD\nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 sets out the requirements for expert witness testimony and\n\nstates:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\n\ntraining, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will\n3 According to Mr. Brown, \u201cEBITDA\u201d stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation,\nand Amortization and \u201cis a measure of cash flow before paying interest on debt.\u201d (D.I. 160, Ex.\nAM at \u00a7 12) According to Dr. Nantell, EBITDA is a \u201cwidely used term and concept in financial\n\nanalysis, standing for earnings before (the payment of) interest and taxes, (plus the non-cash\nexpense of) depreciation and amortization.\u201d (D.I. 158, Ex. AI at f{ 70, n. 99)\n\n3\nhelp the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\nissue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony\nis the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has\nreliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702. The trial court has the \u201ctask of ensuring that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests\non a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\u201d Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms.\nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993).\n\nThe Third Circuit has explained:\n\nRule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony:\nqualification, reliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that\nthe witness possess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this\nrequirement liberally, holding that \u201ca broad range of knowledge, skills, and\ntraining qualify an expert.\u201d Secondly, the testimony must be reliable; it\n\u201cmust be based on the \u2018methods and procedures of science\u2019 rather than on\n\u2018subjective belief or unsupported speculation;\u2019 the expert must have \u2018good\ngrounds\u2019 for his o[r] her belief. In sum, Daubert holds that an inquiry into\nthe reliability of scientific evidence under Rule 702 requires a determination\nas to its scientific validity.\u201d Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert\ntestimony must fit the issues in the case. In other words, the expert\u2019s\ntestimony must be relevant for the purposes of the case and must assist the\ntrier of fact. The Supreme Court explained in Daubert that \u201cRule 702\u2019s\n\u2018helpfulness\u2019 standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent\ninquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\u201d\n\nBy means of a so-called \u201cDaubert hearing,\u201d the district court acts as a\ngatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the\nrequirements of qualification, reliability and fit from reaching the jury.\n\nSchneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, 320 F.3d 396, 404-05 (3d Cir. 2003) (footnote and\n\ninternal citations omitted).*\n\n4 The Court of Appeals wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent\namendments to it were not intended to make any substantive change.\n\n4\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiffs seek to exclude Mr. Brown\u2019s testimony on three grounds: (1) his opinions\nregarding Plaintiffs\u2019 due diligence are outside the scope of his expertise and lack an adequate\nbasis; (2) his opinions will not assist the trier of fact because he did not perform any valuation,\nhas no opinion on the correct damages amount, and any opinions regarding alternative valuation\nmethods are irrelevant; and (3) his opinions rely on incorrect factual assumptions and mere ipse\ndixit assertions and fail to apply any reliable methodology. (D.I. 143)\n\na. Scope\n\nPlaintiffs argue that opinions relating to liability or the adequacy of Plaintiffs\u2019 due\ndiligence are outside the scope of Mr. Brown\u2019s assignment and qualifications as a valuation and\ndamages expert. (D.I. 143 at 8-10) Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Brown failed to conduct any\nindependent investigation of Plaintiffs\u2019 due diligence and, instead, based his opinions only on his\nreview of Dr. Nantell\u2019s report and the documents it referenced, which do not purport to offer a\ncomprehensive list of documents considered or analysis performed. (Jd. at 9-10)\n\nIn response, Defendants assert that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions on valuation due diligence are\nwithin the proper scope for expert testimony and are grounded by sufficient evidence in the\nrecord. (D.I. 180 at 7-8) Defendants argue that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions do not extend to due\ndiligence overall, but rather only to the nature and extent of valuation due diligence commonly\nperformed by buyers, Plaintiffs\u2019 valuation due diligence in this case as reflected by the record,\nand the information available to Plaintiffs to conduct proper valuation due diligence. (/d.)\n\nThe parties agree that Mr. Brown will not offer an opinion on \u201coverall\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d due\n\ndiligence. (D.I. 143 at 9; D.I. 180 at 7) By Mr. Brown\u2019s own description, his report is intended\nto address valuation and damages, not liability. (D.I. 152, Ex. 37 at 83:2-4; 83:15-85:1; 116:13-\n\n16) Brown offers the opinion:\nThe damages constructed in the Nantell Report ignore that the Plaintiffs\nagreed to pay a specific purchase price derived from their own valuation.\nPlaintiffs\u2014despite their sophistication\u2014chose to forego traditional due\ndiligence and traditional valuation approaches in favor of a homemade\nformula...They had all the financial information in their possession to\nnormalize the historical data, and they didn\u2019t.\n\n(D.I. 160, Ex. AM at J 51)\nMr. Brown states in his conclusion that he has \u201cshown that the EBITDA Multiple\nFramework does not capture the available information for valuation and that it produces\ninaccurate results compared with standard methodology. It is not an accurate, valid valuation\nmethodology to use for damage analysis.\u201d (Jd. at { 53) Mr. Brown also opines on numerous\noccasions that Plaintiffs had \u201csufficient information to prepare a valuation using standard\nmethodology.\u201d (Id. at {J 15, 20, 38, 42(b), 44, 50) Notably, Mr. Brown does not identify in his\nreport what he refers to as \u201csufficient information,\u201d other than stating:\nThe basis for my opinions includes the combination of my professional\nexperience in the valuation field, my related qualifications, and the\ncontents of this report. My analysis, comments and opinions describe what\nwas not considered, ignored or missed in the Nantell Report from the\nperspective of describing how I would have performed the valuation of the\nEquity Sale based on the available information.\n\n(d. at | 18)\n\nThe court finds that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinion on the ultimate issue of liability and the\nadequacy of the Plaintiffs\u2019 due diligence should be excluded and the issue reserved for the trier\nof fact. See Berckeley Inv. Group, Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 217 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201can expert\n\nwitness is prohibited from rendering a legal opinion\u201d because \u201c[s]uch testimony... would usurp\n\nthe District Court\u2019s pivotal role in explaining the law\u201d); See also Krys v. Aaron, 112 F. Supp. 3d\n181, 193 (D. N.J. 2015) (internal citations omitted) (a \u201cqualified expert... may not merely\ninstruct the jury on the result to reach based upon a party\u2019s specific conduct or actions\u201d); See\nalso Wolfe v. McNeil-PPC, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 650, 661-62 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (internal\nquotations omitted) (\u201cto the extent [an expert] plans to testify that [a party] behaved negligently\nin the conduct of its business, such testimony constitutes an improper legal opinion\u201d).\n\nb. Helpfulness to the Trier of Fact\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions unhelpfully and irrelevantly focus on his\ncontention that Plaintiffs should have used a more standard methodology rather than the\nmutually agreed-upon EBITDA Multiple Framework.\u2019 (D.I. 143 at 11-13) Plaintiffs assert that\nthe data and information underlying any final valuation is at issue, not the methodology itself.\n(Ud. at 13) Plaintiffs then highlight that Mr. Brown does not offer an opinion on the correct\ndamages amount because his report expressly refuses to assume liability. (/d. at 13-14)\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs contend that the \u201cfit requirement\u201d of Rule 702 is not met because Mr.\nBrown\u2019s opinions fail to help the fact finder understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.\n(Id. at 10-11)\n\nIn response, Defendants argue that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions directly address the disputed\nissues of damages causation and the reliability and credibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 damages evidence.\n(D.L. 180 at 9-12) Mr. Brown concluded that Plaintiffs did not suffer any damages. (Jd. at 12;\nD.I. 160, Ex. AM at 9 49-55) Alternatively, Mr. Brown asserts that Plaintiffs had sufficient\n\nfinancial information to prepare a valuation using standard methodology, but that Plaintiffs\u2019\n\n5 Plaintiffs argue that the parties agreed to use the EBITDA Multiple Framework and that it was\nproposed by Mr. Gilbertson and accepted by Plaintiffs. (D.I. 143 at 12) Defendants, however,\nargue that there was no such agreement, but that Mr. Gilbertson simply proposed a similar\nvaluation methodology in early Agreement discussions. (D.I. 180 at 10)\n\n7\nreliance on, and application of, the nonstandard EBITDA Multiple Framework affected the\npurchase price calculation. (D.I. 180 at 10-12)\n\nAn expert\u2019s testimony is helpful if it \u201cwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.\u201d\nM2M Sols. LLC v. Sierra Wireless Am., Inc., C.A. No. 14-1102-RGA-SRF, 2020 WL 7767639,\nat *16 (D. Del. Dec. 4, 2020) (citing Meadows v. Anchor Longwall & Rebuild, Inc., 306 F. App'x\n781, 790 (3d Cir. 2009)). The Third Circuit has emphasized that the expert\u2019s analysis must \u201cfit\u201d\nhis or her conclusions to the case at hand. Jn re Paoli, 35 F.3d at 745. This requirement \u201cgoes\nprimarily to relevance\u201d and \u201crequires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a\nprecondition to admissibility.\u201d Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591-92.\n\nMr. Brown criticizes Dr. Nantell\u2019s use of the EBITDA Multiple Framework as a\nnonstandard methodology. (D.I. 160, Ex. AM at {\u00a7 24-29) Mr. Brown does not list a valuation\nmethodology he contends Plaintiffs should have used, but cites to two secondary sources \u2014\nInternal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 59-60 and the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d), State on Standard for Valuations Services (\u201cSSVS\u201d) No. 1.\u2014 that\nDefendants contend provide the three most common valuation approaches. (Jd. at \u00a7 23; D.I. 180\nat 14-15) Mr. Brown also claims that \u201crelevant references about the standard valuation\nmethodology that should have been performed can be found\u201d in both sources and that valuations\ncommonly summarize Revenue Ruling 59-60 into \u201ceight factors that should be considered with\nstandard valuation methodology.\u201d (D.I. 160, Ex. AM at \u00a7 30)\n\nMr. Brown\u2019s opinion does not assist the fact finder because he never connects an\nalternative methodology to the facts of the case to explain how it would alter the outcome and\ncompare with Dr. Nantell\u2019s valuation opinion. Mr. Brown instead offers the opinion:\n\nThe main valuation problem here is the use of the rough EBITDA\nMultiple Framework, and not a lack of information. There was sufficient\ninformation to prepare a valuation using standard methodology. Plaintiffs\ndid not need to rely on the EBITDA Multiple Framework or the disputed\ninformation to derive a valuation.\n(D.I. 160, Ex. AM at 750) Thus, Mr. Brown\u2019s opinion should be excluded because \u201cRule 702\u2019s\n\u2018helpfulness\u2019 standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a\nprecondition to admissibility.\u201d In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 743 (3d Cir. 1994)\n(citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591-92); See Karlo v. Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC, 849 F.3d 61, 81\n(3d Cir. 2017) (quotations and citation omitted) (\u201cThe fit requirement ensures that the evidence\nor testimony [helps] the trier of fact understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\u201d).\nc. Reliability\u00ae\nPlaintiffs argue that Mr. Brown\u2019s damages opinions are unreliable because they rely on\nincorrect factual assumptions and mere ipse dixit assertions and are not based on any identified\nmethodology. (D.I. 143 at 15-19) According to Plaintiffs, Mr. Brown does not define or identify\na specific valuation methodology as the standard. (/d.) Further, Plaintiffs argue that several\nexhibits attached to Mr. Brown\u2019s report that purport to show a comparison between audited and\nunaudited financial data contain no description, key, or citations to any document in the factual\nrecord. (/d.) During deposition, Mr. Brown was also unable to identify how he derived the\ninformation in one exhibit. (Jd. at 16-17)\nPlaintiffs further argue that Mr. Brown\u2019s reliance on data created after the close of the\ntransaction undermines the reliability of his opinion. (/d. at 17) Specifically, Plaintiffs note that\n\nMr. Brown analyzes and discusses information contained in the NIS 2018 audited financial\n\n6 Plaintiffs do not dispute that Mr. Brown\u2019s professional experience qualifies him to be an expert\nwitness on valuation as a general matter. (D.I. 190 at 8) However, Plaintiffs claim that valuation\nis not at issue, but instead the misrepresentation of data and information underlying the final\nvaluation. (/d.)\nstatements (\u201c2018 Audited Financials\u201d) completed nearly six months after the transaction. (Jd.)\nHe also attaches as an exhibit a Bloomberg article titled \u201cFrack Sand Producer Plunges as\nPermian Drilling Slows Down\u201d (\u201cBloomberg Article\u201d) that is dated after the close of the\ntransaction. (/d. at 17-18) Plaintiffs contend that, despite Mr. Brown\u2019s representations to the\ncontrary, neither of these sources reflect information known to Plaintiffs at the time of the\nAgreement.\u2019\n\nIn response, Defendants argue that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions are based on his cited\nsecondary sources, \u201cprofessional experience in the valuation field, [] related qualifications, and\nthe contents of [his] report.\u201d (D.I. 180 at 13) According to Defendants, these sources, along\nwith the exhibits attached to Mr. Brown\u2019s report, support Mr. Brown\u2019s conclusion that neither\nPlaintiffs nor Dr. Nantell used standard valuation methodology. (/d. at 16) Further, Defendants\ncontend that Mr. Brown\u2019s report makes clear the tangential nature of both 2018 Audited\nFinancials and the Bloomberg Article. (/d. at 17) Defendants assert that Mr. Brown cites to the\n2018 Audited Financials for the proposition that Plaintiffs should have normalized EBITDA in\ntheir valuation instead of using a forecasted EBITDA. (/d.) Similarly, Defendants assert that\nMr. Brown cites the Bloomberg Article not as evidence of what Plaintiffs had access to during\ndue diligence, but for the proposition that Dr. Nantell\u2019s EBITDA valuation did not consider the\nindustry trends or conditions. (/d.)\n\nThe court finds that Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions do not meet the threshold reliability standard\n\nof Rule 702 and accordingly, the court grants Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude on this basis. \u201c[A]n\n\n7 To the extent the parties disagree over whether Dr. Nantell or Mr. Dore included in their expert\nreports \u201cretrospective\u201d or \u201cretroactive\u201d analysis of data created after the close of the transaction,\nthe Rule 702 admissibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 opinions is not before the court. (See D.I. 143\nat 18-19; D.I. 180 at 17-18)\n\n10\nexpert may introduce new methods of analysis in a rebuttal report if they are offered to contradict\nor rebut another party\u2019s expert.\u201d In re Genetically Modified Rice Litig., 2010 WL 4483993, at *3\n(E.D. Mo. Nov. 1, 2010); See Crowley v. Chait, 322 F. Supp. 2d 530, 551 (D. N.J. 2004). Mr.\nBrown\u2019s report fails to meet this requirement. Mr. Brown offers the opinion:\n\nBecause the amount the Plaintiffs were willing to pay and Defendants\n\nwere willing to accept was $11,115,247.70, the appropriate valuation of\n\nNIS at the time of the transaction is $11,115,247.70. Neither party was\n\nunder any compulsion to buy or sell, and both parties had reasonable\n\nknowledge of relevant facts. Therefore, the transaction did in fact take\n\nplace.\n(D.I. 160, Ex. AM at \u00a7 49) This is not an expert opinion of any sort. It is ipse dixit without any\nfoundation and is nothing more than a recitation of Defendants\u2019 damages argument. (/d.)\n\nIn evaluating Rule 702 admissibility, the \u201cultimate touchtone is helpfulness to the trier of\nfact, and with regard to reliability, helpfulness turns on whether the expert\u2019s \u2018technique or\nprinciple [is] sufficiently reliable so that it will aid the jury in reaching accurate results.\u201d\u201d Tridon\nIndus., Inc. v. Willis Chevrolet, Inc., C.A. No. 12-1070-LPS, 2014 WL 1338678, at *3 (D. Del.\nApril 1, 2014) (emphasis added) (quoting Jn re Paoli, 35 F.3d at 744). Mr. Brown\u2019s opinions\nregarding proper valuation are not grounded in technical or specialized knowledge, and\nultimately fail to aid the fact finder in reaching accurate results. Moreover, the opinions fail to\nsatisfy Rule 702(d) as there is no application of any valuation method to the facts of the case.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 702(d). Therefore, the court grants Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude on this basis.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude the opinions of Defendants\u2019\n\nrebuttal expert is GRANTED.
