Coleman (\u2018Plaintiff\u2019), a former inmate at the James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center (JTVCC) in Smyrna, Delaware, currently housed at the Howard R.\nYoung Correctional Institution in Wilmington, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983.1 (D.I. 3) He appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in\nforma pauperis. (D.I. 5) Before the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\n(D.I. 142) The matter is fully briefed.\nIl. BACKGROUND AND FACTS AS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES\n\nDefendants Kristene Brady-Downes and Michael Stanford were at all material\ntimes correctional officers at JTVCC. Plaintiff alleges that while he was housed at\nJTVCC, and from April 16, 2018 through April 17, 2019, Defendants were deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. (D.I. 3)\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nPlaintiff was seen by JTVCC\u2019s medical staff on April 11, 2018, complaining of eye\npain and light sensitivity. (D.|. 144 at 15) He was advised he would be provided a\n\u201cmemo\u201d authorizing him to wear solar shields. (/d.) When Plaintiff was seen by R.N.\nJoana Bampo on May 18, 2018, he wore solar shields and stated, \u201che got them from\ncommissary,\u201d and that he preferred solar shields from medical staff. (/d. at 13) Plaintiff\nwas told by medical staff that he should obtain his solar shields from the commissary.\n\n(Id.) A September 5, 2018 medical note states that Plaintiff \u201cnas a current order for\n\n1 When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived\nhim of a federal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color\nof state law. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\nsolar shields.\u201d (/d. at 12) On September 28, 2018, Plaintiff was examined by an\nophthalmologist and diagnosed with lagophthalmos and dry eyes.\u201d (D.!. 144 at 11, 20-\n24) The ophthalmologist recommended artificial tears and ointment to lubricate the\ndryness. (/d. at 11, 24)\n\nDuring an October 19, 2018 medical visit, Plaintiff continued to complain of\nheadaches and light sensitivity and requested solar shields. (/d. at 10) On November\n14, 2018, Plaintiff was provided solar shields per medical provider order. (/d. at 10)\nPlaintiff testified that he also wore sunglasses and that an inmate can purchase non-\nprescription sunglasses at the prison commissary without medical approval. (/d. at 53)\nPlaintiff testified that in his mind sunglasses and solar shades are two different names\nfor \u201cthe same thing.\u201d> (/d.)\n\nJTVCC inmate housing rules require an inmate to remove sunglasses when\nindoors. (/d. at 5 8.0.M. (\u201cAuthorized sunglasses . . . will be removed indoors . . . or\nwhen requested by any staff member.\u201d). During the relevant times, medical memoranda\nwere issued for Plaintiff to possess solar shields. (/d. at 17, 26) One medical\nmemorandum, administratively approved on September 12, 2018 stated: \u201csolar shields\nsensitivity to light due to left eye.\u201d (/d. at 17) The start date was April 16, 2018 and the\nend day was April 16, 2019 (/d.) The second medical memorandum states \u201csolar\n\nshields . . . start date: October 19, 2018 end date: October 19, 2019.\u201d (/d. at 26)\n\n2 Patients affected with lagophthalmos are unable to fully close their eyelids, and may\ndescribe symptoms of dry and irritated eyes. See https:/Awww.aao.org/eyenet/article/\nlagophthalmos-evaluation-treatment (last visited Feb. 4, 2022).\n\n3 In his Complaint, Plaintiff states, \u201cI use the commissary shades more than the ones\nfrom medical cause the commissary shades make things darker the solar shield\nprovided from medical seem{s] to just take yellow out of colors.\u201d (D.I. 3 at 7)\nNeither medical memorandum stated that Plaintiff was allowed to wear solar shields or\ncommissary sunglasses indoors. (/d. at 17, 26)\n\nPrior to March 25, 2019, Brady-Downes had seen Plaintiff wear sunglasses\nindoors and switch to solar shields after Brady-Downes told him if he continued to wear\nthe sunglasses it would result in disciplinary action. (D.I. 92 at 2) On March 25, 2019,\nBrady-Downes was on duty and saw Plaintiff wear sunglasses indoors as he headed to\nthe shower. (/d. at 18, 54, 55) Plaintiff was told that the sunglasses he was wearing\nwere not authorized by medical staff. (/d. at 28). Plaintiff removed the sunglasses and\nreplied that he had a medical memorandum for the sunglasses. (/d. at 45)\n\nAt the time Sgt. Heather Sampson was present, and she accessed Plaintiff's\nrecords to look for medical memoranda. (D.I. 92 at 3, 5) She did not find a memo that\napproved Plaintiffs wearing of commissary sunglasses indoors and she called a\nmedical staff member to verify this. (/d.) A nurse looked through Plaintiff's medical\nfiles, verbally confirmed that he did not have a medical memo to wear commissary\nsunglasses indoors, and informed Sampson that Plaintiff had a medical memo for light\nsensitivity and could wear prescribed solar shades. (D.I. 92 at 5; D.I. 144 at 27)\nPlaintiff was informed that there was no paperwork to confirm that he was allowed to\nwear commissary sunglasses indoors. (D.I. 92 at 2) Brady-Downes warned Plaintiff\nthat he would receive a write-up if he continued to wear the sunglasses, as they were\nnot medically authorized. (D.I. 144 at 28) Plaintiff was given the option to wear his\nprescribed solar shades to avoid being written up; instead he put the sunglasses back\non his face. (D.I. 92 at 2; D.I. 144 at 28, 45) Brady-Downes issued Plaintiff a\n\ndisciplinary report for lying and failing to obey an order and confiscated the sunglasses\n\n3\nas evidence. (D.I. 144 at 28) Plaintiff appealed, and the decision was reversed on the\nbasis that \u201cinmate has a medical memo for the solar shields.\u201d (D.I. 150-1 at 24)\n\nPlaintiff did not ask Brady-Downes for medical attention and did not seek medical\ncare after the sunglasses were confiscated, and it was not until March 28, 2019\u2014three\ndays later\u2014when he submitted a sick call slip for eye pain. (D.I. 144 at 27, 31,47) A\nfew days after the March 25, 2019 incident Plaintiff purchased \u201canother pair of\ncommissary sunglasses\u201d from another inmate. (/d. at 58) Medical records dated\nMarch, 2019 refer to an administrative sick call when Plaintiff inquired about a security\nmemo for solar shields and commissary sunglasses. (D.I. 150-1 at 57) The note states\nPlaintiff \u201chas security memos located in ichrt [sic]. Security staff made aware.\u201d (/d.)\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Stanford saw Plaintiff wearing sunglasses indoors in the chow\nhall. (/d. at 33, 58, 64) Stanford told Plaintiff that sunglasses were for outdoor use only\nand ordered Plaintiff to remove them. (/d.) Plaintiff refused, Stanford repeated the\norder for Plaintiff to remove the sunglasses, and Plaintiff again refused. (/d.) Stanford\ntold Plaintiff that he could not wear the sunglasses indoors unless he had a prescription\nthat approved sunglasses for indoor use, Plaintiff replied they were prescribed, and\nStanford responded that Plaintiff was wearing commissary non-prescription sunglasses.\n(/d. at 33, 58, 59, 64) Stanford again asked Plaintiff to remove the sunglasses, and\nPlaintiff refused. (/d. at 33, 64) Stanford searched on the JTVCC\u2019s shared drive for any\nmedical memoranda for Plaintiff. (/d. at 33) Stanford found one medical memo that\nstated that Plaintiff was allowed to have solar shades from the commissary, but the\nmemo did not specifically state that Plaintiff was allowed to wear sunglasses indoors.\n\nAccordingly, Stanford called medical staff for clarification and was informed that Plaintiff\n\n4\nwas allowed to use solar shields indoors until the memo expired on April 16, 2019. (/d.\nat 33, 65) The memo did not permit Plaintiff to wear commissary sunglasses indoors.\n(Id.) Stanford issued Plaintiff a disciplinary report for disorderly behavior and failing to\nobey an order. (/d.) Testimony was provided at the disciplinary hearing that Plaintiff did\nnot have medical approval to wear sunglasses indoors. (/d. at 35)\n\nAt the time of the April 1, 2019 incident, Stanford did not know that Plaintiff had\nan eye condition or light sensitivity and did not know that the removal of Plaintiffs\nsunglasses would result in any danger or substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiffs\nhealth or safety. (/d. at 65) Stanford did not confiscate Plaintiffs glasses. (/d.) Plaintiff\ndid not inform Stanford that the removal of his sunglasses would result in any injury or\npain. (/d. at 59, 65)\n\nPlaintiff filed this action on April 17, 2019. (D.I. 3) A month later, on May 15,\n2019, a memo for solar eye shields was approved with a start date of April 22, 2019 and\nan end date of October 22, 2019. (D.I. 150-1 at 43) The memo made no mention of\nwearing sunglasses indoors. (/d.) On November 18, 2019, Plaintiff obtained a memo\nallowing him to wear commissary sunglasses and prescribed solar shields indoors and\noutdoors with a start date of October 14, 2019 and an end date of October 14, 2020.\n(D.I. 144 at 40; D.I. 150-1 at 39-40) On December 20, 2019, Plaintiff presented for a\nfollow-up visit with an ophthalmologist. (D.I. 144 at 42-48) The ophthalmologist\nobserved a decrease in the lagophthalmos and no other \u201cocular abnormality present.\u201d\n(Id.).\n\nDefendants move for summary judgment. (D.I. 142) Plaintiff opposes. (D.I. 150)\nlll. Legal Standards\n\nA court must grant summary judgment \u201cif the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of\ndemonstrating the absence of any genuine issues of material fact. Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the\nnon-moving party, then the moving party may satisfy its burden of production by\npointing to an absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case, after which\nthe burden of production then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of\na genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\nU.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-\n61 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\nMaterial facts are those \u201cthat could affect the outcome\u201d of the proceeding.\nLamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011). \u201c[A] dispute about a material\nfact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict\nfor the non-moving party.\u201d /d. (internal quotation marks omitted). A non-moving party\nasserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \u201c(A) citing\nto particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents,\nelectronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, . .. admissions,\ninterrogatory answers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the\nopposing party] do not establish the absence . . . of a genuine dispute ....\u201d Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(c)(1). The non-moving party's evidence \u201cmust amount to more than a\nscintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a preponderance.\u201d\n\nWilliams, 891 F.2d at 460-61.\nThe court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476\nF.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). \u201c[T]he facts asserted by the nonmoving party, if supported\nby affidavits or other evidentiary material, must be regarded as true... .\u201d Aman v. Cort\nFumiture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, 1080 (3d Cir. 1996). If \u201cthere is any evidence in\nthe record from any source from which a reasonable inference in the [nonmoving\nparty's] favor may be drawn, the moving party simply cannot obtain a summary\njudgment.\u201d /d.\nIV. Discussion\n\nA. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\nPlaintiff brings suit against Defendants in their individual and official capacities.\nDefendants move for summary judgment on the official capacity claims. The Eleventh\nAmendment of the United States Constitution protects an unconsenting state or state\nagency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens, regardless of the\nrelief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Hailderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651\n(1974). In addition, \u201ca suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a\nsuit against the official but rather is a suit against the official\u2019s office. As such, it is no\ndifferent from a suit against the State itself.\u201d Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491\nU.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal citations omitted); Ali v Howard, 353 F. App\u2019x 667, 672 (3d\nCir. 2009). Accordingly, \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary damages against a state official in\n\nhis official capacity, like Defendants, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See id.\nSummary judgment on this issue is appropriate as a matter of law as Defendants\nhave Eleventh Amendment immunity for the official capacity claims raised against them.\nDefendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the issue will be granted.\n\nB. Eighth Amendment\n\nThe Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment\nobligates jail authorities to provide medical care to inmates. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 103 (1976); Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). Plaintiff\nclaims that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment because he \u201cwas punished for wearing medically\nauthorized sunglasses\u201d and \u201cthe glasses were taken from him, and Defendants were\naware that there were medical memos authorizing the use of the glasses at issue\u201d by\nhim indoors. D.I. 150 at 1. Defendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that\nPlaintiff cannot show that his eye condition is a serious medical need, he fails to show\nthat Defendants were deliberately indifferent, and Defendants should not be liable\nbecause they acted reasonably. | need address only the third argument.\n\n\u201c[P]rison officials who act reasonably cannot be found liable under the Cruel and\nUnusual Punishments Clause.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 845 (1994). The\nundisputed material facts establish that both Defendants acted reasonably here. Both\nDefendants asked Plaintiff to remove his sunglasses because prison rules prohibit\ninmates from wearing sunglasses indoors. Both Defendants searched for a medical\nmemo to determine if Plaintiff was allowed for medical reasons to wear sunglasses\nindoors. No such memo existed at the time of the incidents in question. Memos\n\nauthorized Plaintiff at that time to wear solar shields, not sunglasses. Cf. Martin v.\n\n8\nHedgpeth, 2015 WL 2266486, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 14, 2015) (distinguishing tinted\nglasses from solar shields).\n\nIn addition, Stanford was unaware that Plaintiff had an eye condition or light\nsensitivity. Brady-Downes knew that Plaintiff has been prescribed solar shields, but not\nsunglasses, for indoor use. And, both Defendants reasonably relied upon information\nprovided to them by medical staff. Non-medical prison officials are generally justified in\nrelying on the expertise and care of prison medical providers. Matthews v.\nPennsylvania Dep't of Corr., 613 F. App\u2019x 163, 170 (3d Cir. 2015). Also, both\nDefendants gave Plaintiff the option to replace the sunglasses with solar shields.\nPlaintiff, by his own admission, refused those offers and continued to wear the\nsunglasses.\n\nNotably, Plaintiff did not ask Defendants for medical attention at the time of either\noccurrence. (With regard to the Brady-Downes incident, Plaintiff did not seek medical\nattention until three days later.) Nor is there record evidence that either Defendant had\nreason to believe that Plaintiff would incur substantial risk of serious harm if he did not\nwear sunglasses or if he wore solar shields instead of sunglasses. In short, no\nreasonable jury could find that either Defendant acted unreasonably during the incidents\nin question. Both Defendants were aware that Plaintiff was flouting prison rules, and\nboth reached out to medical personnel before issuing Plaintiff disciplinary reports.\n\nPlaintiff submitted a sworn statement in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion. (D.I.\n151 at 1-5) An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion for summary\njudgment must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible\n\nin evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters\n\n9\nstated.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). In supporting a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe\naffiant must ordinarily set forth facts, rather than opinions or conclusions.\u201d Maldonado\nv. Ramirez, 757 F.2d 48, 51 (3d Cir. 1985). \u201cAn affidavit that is \u2018essentially conclusory\nand lacking in specific facts\u2019 is inadequate to satisfy the movant\u2019s burden.\u201d /d. (citations\nomitted).\n\nPlaintiff states in the declaration that he \u201cspoke to Sgt. Stanford about the\nmedical necessity of [his] glasses on multiple occasions prior to\u201d the April 1, 2019\nincident. But even if that were the case, in light of the JTVCC\u2019s ban on wearing\nsunglasses indoors, it would have been reasonable for Stanford to reject what Plaintiff\ntold him and rely instead on the memo that authorized Plaintiff to wear solar shields and\non the JTVCC medical staff who told Stanford that Plaintiff was allowed for medical\nreasons to wear solar shields, not sunglasses.\n\nPlaintiff also relies on a March 30, 2019 medical note as evidence that Standard\nwas aware of a medical memorandum. The note states, \u201cPatient has security memos\nlocated in ichrt. Security staff made aware.\u201d (D.I. 150-1 at 57) The note, however,\ndoes not identify a particular correctional officer, and provides no other facts to support\nthese statements, some of which are conclusory.\n\nPlaintiffs declaration further states that Brady-Downes did not verify Plaintiffs\nmedical memo status; that he spoke to Brady-Downes on several occasions about his\nmedical condition and the need for glasses; and that after the confiscation Plaintiff\nsubmitted several sick calls for headaches due to the lack of glasses. (D.I. 151 at 1-5)\nPlaintiff again relies upon the March 30, 2019 medical note to support his statements.\n\nThe note was entered several days after the March 25, 2019 incident and does not\n\n10\nrefute other documents that Brady-Downes contacted medical staff at the time of the\nMarch 25, 2019 incident. In addition, the statements do not contain a bases for the\nfacts asserted, are conclusory, and are not supported by the record.\n\nFinally, although a medical memorandum allowed Plaintiff to wear sunglasses\nand solar shields indoors, it was not issued until after the two incidents at issue and,\ntherefore, is not relevant. Nor is it relevant that the disciplinary report issued by Brady-\nDownes that resulted in Plaintiff's finding of guilt was later reversed. The Court looks at\nthe events as the time they occurred. For both incidents Defendants issued disciplinary\nreports based upon the fact that Plaintiff was not allowed to wear sunglasses indoors,\nrefused orders to remove them, and continued to wear them.\n\nBased upon the record evidence, no reasonable jury could find that Defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs serious medical needs or that Defendants\nacted unreasonably. Therefore, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion for summary\njudgment on the Eighth Amendment claim.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion for summary\n\njudgment.4 (D.I. 142)\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\n4 | will not address the issue of qualified immunity given that summary judgment is\nappropriate on other grounds.\n11\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nDEVIN L.
