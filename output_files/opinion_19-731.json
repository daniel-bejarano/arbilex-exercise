C2B, CLAUDE BLANDIN , \nBRUNO BLANDIN , PATRICK BLANDIN , \nARNO LEONI, and JOHN DOE \nDEFENDANTS 1-10, \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 19-731-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nIn his Report & Recommendation (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 56), 1 the Magistrate Judge \nrecommends that I GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-PART Defendants ' motion to dismiss and \nstrike (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 42). Specifically , he recommends that I grant Defendants ' motion \nto dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants and deny the motion in \nall other respects. In the same Report (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 56 at 32), the Magistrate Judge \nDENIED Plaintiff's motion for jurisdictional discovery (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 45). \nDefendants ECB, AVC, and C2B object to two of the Magistrate Judge's findings: (1) that \nZausner has standing to bring this action, and (2) that Zausner stated a claim for breach of the \nStock Pledge Agreement. (D.I. 216). Zausner objects to two of the Magistrate Judge's findings: (1) \nUnless otherwise specified , citations to docket entries herein refer to Case No. 19-731-\nRGA-CJB. Pursuant to an Order signed by the Magistrate Judge on February 2, 2022, in C.A. \nNo. 20-1769-RGA-CJB, \"all future filings [in this matter] shall be made in the lead case only, \nCase No. 19-731-RGA-CJB. \" \n1 that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Individual Defendants , and (2) that Zausner has \nnot made the prima facie showing required to be permitted to take jurisdictional discovery from \nthe Individual Defendants . (D.I. 217). The objections are fully briefed. (D.I. 216, 217, 220, 221) \nI consider the challenged recommendations de novo.2 \nDefendants ' First Objection \nDefendants object to the finding that Plaintiff has prudential standing to bring this action, \narguing, \"The SPA contains an anti-assignment clause prohibiting ZNHC from assigning its rights, \nby operation of law or otherwise , without the written consent of ECB USA and Atlantic \nVentures. \" (D.I. 216 at 2) (emphasis in original). Defendants argue Zausner became ZNHC's \nsuccessor via a \"merger effected under the Delaware merger statute,\" and, \"Under Delaware law, \na merger is an 'assignment by operation of law.\"' (Id. at 2-3 ( citing MI'A Canada Royalty Corp. v. \nCompania Minera Pangea, S.A. de C. V, 2020 WL 5554161, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 16, 2020)). \nTherefore , Defendants argue, the anti-assignment provision of the SPA, which states, \"Neither \nparty may directly or indirectly assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this \nAgreement , by operation of law or otherwise , without the prior written consent of the other party,\" \nprecluded a transfer of ZNHC's enforcement rights to its successor , Zausner. \nI disagree. \nI agree with the Magistrate Judge that the first sentence of the SPA's \"Assignment \" \nprovision , \"This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto \nand their respective successors, heirs, legal representatives and permitted assigns,\" makes clear \n2 I consider Plaintiff's objection to the non-case-dispositive motion for jurisdictional \ndiscovery under a \"clearly erroneous or ... contrary to law\" standard. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). \n2 that the parties intended to grant the parties' \"successors \" enforcement rights with respect to the \nSPA, merely by virtue of their being the parties' successors. (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 39 Ex. 1 ,r \nXII.4). This successors ' enforcement right is derived from the SPA itself, not from the assignment \nof rights \"by operation of law\" that accompanies a merger. See Corp. Exp. Office Products , Inc. v. \nPhillips, 847 So.2d 406,415 n.6 (Fla. 2003) (noting, under Florida law, \"the rights of the merged \ncorporation become those of the surviving corporation \"). That the provision also grants \nenforcement rights to \"permitted assigns\" implies the parties intended to distinguish successors \nfrom permitted assigns. As the Magistrate Judge points out, there are many ways besides a merger \nfor rights to be assigned from the parties to a third party, either \"by operation of law\" or otherwise . \n(C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 56 at 9-10). \nEven if Delaware law were controlling , 3 Defendants ' argument that MFA Canada is \ndispositive on this issue of contract interpretation would still be unpersuasive . Unlike Section XII.4 \nof the SPA, the relevant provision of the Agreement at issue in MFA Canada begins with an anti\u00ad\nassignment clause prohibiting assignment \"by operation or law or otherwise ... without the prior \nwritten consent of each other party,\" and then states, \"Subject to the preceding sentence,4 this \nAgreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and \ntheir respective successors and assigns.\" MFA Canada Royalty Corp. v. Compania Miner a Pangea, \nS.A. de C. V, 2020 WL 5554161, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 16, 2020) (emphasis and footnote \n3 It is not. I find it is clear from the SPA's choice of law provision that Florida law governs \nthe instant dispute. (20-1769 , D.I. 39 Ex. 1 ,r XII.5 (\"This Agreement shall be governed by, \nconstrued and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida applicable to \ncontracts made and to be wholly performed within such State.\")). \n4 The Court in MFA Canada notes, \"The use of 'sentence' instead of 'sentences ' in [the \nrelevant provision] likely is a drafting anomaly.\" MFA Canada, 2020 WL 5554161, at *5. \n3 added). In MFA Canada, the anti-assignment clause unambiguously curtailed the successors ' \nenforcement right granted by the Agreement. Here, that is not the case. \nFor these reasons, in addition to the reasons articulated by the Magistrate Judge in his \nReport and Recommendation, Defendants ' First Objection is OVERRULED . \nDefendants' Second Objection \nDefendants object to the finding that Plaintiff stated a claim against ECB and AVC in \nCounts II and IV for (1) breach of the Stock Pledge Agreement , and (2) breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the Stock Pledge Agreement. \nDefendants argue the Magistrate Judge \"rewrite[ s ]\" portions of the Stock Pledge \nAgreement in finding that, by alleging that ECB and AVC caused SFI to enter into an insolvency \nproceeding that rendered the Collateral essentially worthless, Plaintiff had stated a claim for breach \nof Section 8 of the Stock Pledge Agreement . (D.I. 216 at 7). \nI disagree. \nSection 8 of the Stock Pledge Agreement prohibits Defendants from doing anything to \n\"dispose of ... any of the Collateral or any interest therein except as expressly provided for herein \nor with the prior written consent of the Secured Party.\" (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 39-1, Ex.Cat 4). \nDefendants claim, \"There is no allegation that [ECB]/AVC ever did anything to interfere with the \nCollateral -the shares of SFI.\" (D.I. 216 at 8). This is simply not true. As the Magistrate Judge \nnotes, Plaintiff specifically alleges in its complaint that, by causing SFI to enter the insolvency \nproceeding, ECB andAVC \"destroyed, dissipated and disposed of the value of Zausner's security \ninterest in 90% of the shares of SFI.\" (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 56 at 26-27 (citing C.A. No. 20-\n4 1769, D.I. 39 ,r 108)). By alleging ECB and AVC took actions to render the Collateral worthless , \nPlaintiff has sufficiently alleged a breach of the Stock Pledge Agreement. \nDefendants ' entire argument relating to Count IV is based on its contention , \"there is no \nunderlying breach of the Stock Pledge Agreement. \" (D.I. 16 at 9). Because, for the reasons stated \nabove, I agree with the Magistrate Judge's finding that Plaintiff has successfully alleged a breach \nof the Stock Pledge Agreement , I also agree that Defendants ' challenge to the allegations of a \nbreach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing also fails. \nFor these reasons, Defendants ' Second Objection is OVERRULED . \nPlaintiff's First Objection \nZausner objects to the Magistrate Judge's finding that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction \nover the Individual Defendants , arguing, \"the Individual Defendants meet the foreseeability prong \nof the 'closely related' test, such that they are bound by the [SPA]'s forum selection clause, and as \nsuch, Zausner has established that this Court has personal jurisdiction over the Individual \nDefendants. \" (D.I. 217 at 1). \nZausner argues that I found this Court had personal jurisdiction over Savencia S.A. under \nthe \"closely related\" test, and therefore, this Court must also have personal jurisdiction over the \nIndividual Defendants who, Zausner argues, \"were much more actively involved than Savencia \nS.A. was in negotiating and executing the SPA.\" (Id. at 2-3) (overemphasis in original). This \nargument is utterly unpersuasive. In finding this Court had personal jurisdiction over Savencia, I \nadopted in full the Magistrate Judge's finding that \"Savencia affirmatively sought transfer of venue \n5 to this court pursuant to Section 1404(a), and thereby consented to personal jurisdiction in \nDelaware. \" (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 135 at 17, adopted in full, D.I. 141). Individual Defendants \nhave not similarly consented to personal jurisdiction in this District. \nZausner makes no other substantive arguments in support of its objection. Therefore , I \nadopt the Magistrate Judge's reasoning in full supporting his finding that this Court does not have \npersonal jurisdiction over Individual Defendants. Plaintiff's First Objection is OVERRULED. \nPlaintiff's Second Objection \nZausner makes no additional substantive arguments in support of its second objection, that \nthe Magistrate Judge erred in finding Plaintiff has not made the prima facie showing of personal \njurisdiction required for the Court to permit Zausner to conduct jurisdictional discovery. Instead, \nZausner makes speculative arguments , suggesting jurisdictional discovery is necessary for it to \nmake its prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction. (D.I. 217 at 3-6). As the Magistrate Judge \nexplains, that is not the law in the Third Circuit. To be entitled to jurisdictional discovery , a plaintiff \nmust make a \"required threshold showing\" by \"present[ing] factual allegations that suggest 'with \nreasonable particularity ' the possible existence of the requisite 'contacts between [the party] and \nthe forum state.\"' Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. v. Step Two, 318 F.3d 446, 456 (3d Cir. 2003). I find, for the \nreasons articulated by the Magistrate Judge in his Report and Recommendation , Plaintiff has not \ndone that here. \nTherefore , Plaintiff 's Second Objection is OVERRULED. \nThe Report & Recommendation is ADOPTED . The motion to dismiss (C.A. No. 20-\n1769, D.I. 42) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART. The Claims against Individual \n6 Defendants are DISMISSED for lack of personal jurisdiction. The objection to the denial of the \nmotion for jurisdictional discovery (C.A. No. 20-1769, D.I. 45) is OVERRULED. \nEntered this Z'i day of March, 2022. \n7 "}
