No. 20-1695-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \n1. Background. Plaintiff Jermain Jefferies, who appears pro se, filed this \nemployment discrimination action pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \namended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e. (D.I. 1) Plaintiff resides in Pennsylvania and he was \nemployed by Defendant at its place of business in Pennsylvania. (Id. at 1-2) Before \nthe Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss for improper venue or, in the alternative to \ntransfer venue. (D.I. 6) The motion is unopposed. \n2. Discussion. Employment discrimination claims are governed by Title \nVll's venue statute, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3), which provides in pertinent part that: \nSuch an action may be brought in any judicial district in the State in which \nthe unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in \nthe judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such \npractice are maintained and administered, or in the judicial district in which \nthe aggrieved person would have worked but for the alleged unlawful \nemployment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such \ndistrict, such an action may be brought within the judicial district in which \nthe respondent has his principal office. \nId. at 20003-5(f)(3}. Title Vll's venue provisions are exclusive. See Emrick v. \nBethlehem Steel Corp., 624 F.2d 450,453 (3d Cir. 1980}; Kabacinski v. Bostrom \n1 Seating, Inc., 98 F. App'x 78, 82-3 (3d Cir. 2004). Filing a lawsuit in an improper \nvenue is not necessarily fatal to its claims as this Court has discretion to transfer the \nmatter to proper venue. \n3. As Defendant correctly states, there is no basis for venue in this Court. \nThere is no dispute that Plaintiff was employed by Defendant in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania , he complains of employment discrimination that occurred in Philadelphia , \nand witnesses , evidence, and records relating to Plaintiff's employment are located \neither in Philadelphia or at Defendant's principal office in Atlanta, Georgia. (D.I. at 1-3; \nD.I. 1-3 at 3-6; D.I. 8 at 2) Defendant is correct that proper venue lies in the United \nState District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \n4. Venue does not properly lie in the District of Delaware. The Court \ndeclines to grant Defendant's motion dismiss the complaint. Instead, it will grant \nDefendant's alternative motion to transfer. \n5. Conclusion . For the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny \nDefendant's motion to dismiss; (2) grant Defendant's motion to transfer venue; and (3) \ndirect the Clerk of Court to transfer this action to the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania . A separate order shall issue. \nDated: March 7, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n2 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJERMAINE JEFFERIES , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, \nDefendant. : Civ. No. 20-1695-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this Seventh day of March 2022; \nIT IS ORDERED that: \n1. Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED. (D.I. 6) \n2. Defendant's alternative motion to transfer venue is GRANTED. (0.1. 6) \n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to TRANSFER this action to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania . \n4. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE this case. \n!J-l i7' fuJudge "}
