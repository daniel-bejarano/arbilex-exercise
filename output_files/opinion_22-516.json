NEWMAN,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 516-RGA \n      : UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  :        :   Defendant.    : \n \n Shantell  D. Newman , New Castle , Delaware .  Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n  December  9, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4).  She commenced this action on April 22, 2022.  \n(D.I. 2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff states that her \u201cfreedom was stole\u201d  when \ndocuments were \u201c faked \u201d in order to \u201cwrite B onds\u201d and \u201ccollect interest.\u201d  (D.I. 2 at 4).  \nShe alleges the \u201ccharges were made up.\u201d  ( Id.).  Plaintiff also wants \u201cfreedom out of \nbondage.\u201d  ( Id. at 5).  She alleges her rights were stolen and given to others, she was \nnever given any information about  her birth certificate or social security num ber and \n\u201cthis strawman -Corp wasn\u2019t [her] will.\u201d  ( Id.).  Plaintiff wants the nation to \u201coperate in love \nand peace.\u201d  ( Id.).   \n Plaintiff seeks 100 billion dollar s and reparations from slavery.  ( Id. at 7).  \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening  \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept 2 \n all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, h er \npleading is liberally construed and her  Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyer s.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94.    \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims  for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not 3 \n dismissed, however, for imperfect statements  of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id . at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause t hey are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is pl ausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n The United States is Defendant   Defendant  is immune from suit.   It is well \nestablished that an action against the United States cannot be maintained unless the United States waives its sovereign immunity.  United States v. Mitchell , 445 U.S. 535, \n538 (1980).  A waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.  Id . (citing United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969)).  \u201cI t is \naxiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction. \u201d  United States v. Mitch ell, 463 \nU.S. 206, 212 (1983).   Accordingly, the Complaint will be dismissed.   \n  4 \n  CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (iii).  Amendment is futile.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 516-RGA \n      : UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  :        :   Defendant.    : \n \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 9th day of  December , 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that:  \n1.
