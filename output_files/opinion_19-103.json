INTRODUCTION\nThe defendant, Kimberly Sponaugle (\"Ms. Sponaugle,\" \"Sponaugle,\" \"Defendant,\" or\n\"the Defendant\"), was indicted hy a grand jury sitting in the District of Delaware on one count of\nwire fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. On December 15, 2021, after a seven-day trial, a\njury convicted her. (See D.I. 93-99) (\"Trial Tr.\") Later that month, the Court met with counsel\nto discuss issues relating to sentencing. (See D.I. ICQ) After obtaining the parties' preliminary\nviews on certain likely issues that would need to he resolved in cormection with calculating the\napplicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"Sentencing Guidelines,\" \"Guidelines,\"\n\"U.S.S.G.,\" or \"SG\"), and after the Court expressed concern as to whether the trial record would\nhe sufficient to allow it to make the necessary determinations, the Court subsequently presided\nover four days of additional proceedings, at which both parties called witnesses to the stand to\nprovide evidence; presented other testimony from victims of Ms. Sponaugle's crime and from\nindividuals who could speak to her character; and provided oral argument. (See D.I. 119, 122)\n(\"Sent. Tr.\")'\nOn March 3, 2022, the United States Probation Office (\"Probation Office\" or \"USPO\")\nfiled a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"). (D.I. 109) On April 25, 2022, the Probation\nOffice submitted a revised PSR, which included the parties' extensive written arguments\nregarding the Guidelines calculations. (D.I. 115)\n' There are four sentencing hearing transcripts. (See D.I. 119-22) Some of them re-use the same\npage numbers. Hence, the Court uses the following convention to refer to the sentencing\ntranscripts: March 10, 2022 is volume \"A;\" March 11, 2022 is \"B;\" April 4, 2022 is \"C;\" and\nApril 28, 2022 is \"D.\" Accordingly, citations to the sentencing hearing transcripts are in the\nfollowing format: \"[Witness Last Name] Sent. Tr. [volume letter] at [page number].\"\n1Having considered the now-extensive record created at trial and dnring the subsequent\nhearings relating to sentencing, as well as all written submissions made in connection with\nsentencing (see, e.g., D.I. 105,106), the Court herein rules on Ms. Sponaugle's objections to the\nPSR and sets out the Guidelines range it will apply in connection with the forthcoming\nsentencing. Before doing so, the Court first provides background information, including a\ndiscussion of All About Women, PA (\"AAW\") and Ms. Sponaugle's role in the practice,\nfindings on pertinent aspects of the culture of AAW, and a description of the investigation, trial,\nand sentencing proceedings to this point. The Court also addresses what is \"necessarily implied\"\nby the jury's verdict finding the Defendant guilty and what, therefore, the Court must accept as\ntrue for purposes of sentencing.\nII. BACKGROUND^\nA. AAW And Ms. Sponaugle's Role In The Practice\nAAW is an obstetric and gynecological healthcare practice that was founded as a\npartnership in 2001 by several doctors. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 404, 502)^ With the doctors\nfocused on providing healthcare to women m the community, AAW needed someone else to\nhandle the business aspects of the practice. (See D.I. 73 at 4; McCracken Trial Tr. at 406)\nInitially, the doctors had assistance from Steve McBride, then-partner Dr. McBride's father, who\nwould write checks and help with the books. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 501-02) At some point,\nTom Mazzello served as practice manager; he was terminated after two years, when Mr.\n^ All of the factual findings throughout this Opinion are supported by at least a preponderance of\nthe evidence. Fact findings necessarily implied in the jury's guilty verdict are supported by\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n^ All citations to the trial transcripts (D.I. 93-99) are in the format: \"[Witness Last Name] Trial\nTr. at [page number].\"McBride caught him allegedly stealing from the practice. (McCullough Trial Tr. at 685-87)\nAfter that, Mr. McBride again provided assistance, continuing to do so until Dr. McBride left\nAAW. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1233-34,1240)\nIn 2005, the partners hired Ms. Sponaugle to serve as AAW's practice manager. (See\nD.I. 73 at 4; McCracken Trial Tr. at 408) She was hired as an employee, not a partner, and\nremained a non-partner employee at all times she was with AAW. (See D.l. 73 at 4; McCracken\nTrial Tr. at 431) Little effort was made to define Ms. Sponaugle's duties at the time of her hiring\nor thereafter. (McCullough Trial Tr. at 691-92,697-98)\nIn 2006, soon after the partners hired Ms. Sponaugle, AAW became a subsidiary of\nChristianaCare, a regional healthcare system. (See D.I. 73 at 4; McCracken Trial Tr. at 412) As\nrequired by ChristianaCare, in this period outside accountants reviewed and audited AAW's\nfinancial practices. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 413)\nIn 2012, AAW separated from ChristianaCare and reverted to being a private practice.\n(See D.I. 73 at 4; McCracken Trial Tr. at 414) From that point on, and for the remainder of Ms.\nSponaugle's tenure, there was minimal independent oversight of AAW's finances, although the\ndoctor-partners assumed otherwise. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 415,418, 505; McCullough Trial\nTr. at 684-85)\nMs. Sponaugle's role at AAW expanded significantly over time. Her title evolved from\n\"practice manager\" to \"director\" and eventually \"CEO\" of the practice. (McCracken Trial Tr. at\n410) In time, Ms. Sponaugle was responsible for managing the practice's day-to-day operations,\nincluding scheduling, finances, human resources, payroll, overseeing 65 employees,\ncommunicating with vendors, and recording and paying bills. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 410;\nSponaugle Trial Tr. at 1274-76)\n3Prior to working at AAW, Ms. Sponaugle had earned an MBA with a specialization in\nhealthcare management, but she had no education in or experience with bookkeeping or\naccoimting. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1224-29,1236) She was given responsibility for AAW's\naccounting but received little training in QuickBooks, the program Ms. Sponaugle's predecessors\nhad set up and used to track AAW's receipts and expenditures. (McCullough Trial Tr. at 692-94;\nSponaugle Trial Tr. at 1247) Julie Morgan, an accountant, gave Sponaugle a short introduction\nto QuickBooks, lasting maybe \"five minutes.\" (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1247) No one at the\npractice formally defined Ms. Sponaugle's accounting-related duties; the doctors simply\nassumed she had an adequate background to perform these duties. (McCullough Trial Tr. at 691-\n95)\nAs Ms. Sponaugle's role at AAW expanded, her compensation increased. When she was\nhired in 2005, her annual salary was $60,000. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 517) The following year,\nshe was given a raise to $65,000. (Jd.) In 2007, she received another raise to $68,000. {Id.) Her\nnext raise came two years later, when her annual salary went up to $78,000. {Id.) Then in 2010,\nher salary increased yet again to $88,000. {Id.) At the same time, she also started receiving a\nmonthly vehicle allowance of $600, the same amount the doctor-partners received. {Id. at 518)\nIn 2011, Ms. Sponaugle received another raise, making her salary $100,000 a year. {Id.\nat 517-18) She also became entitled to a quarterly bonus equal to five percent of her base salary\n($5,000) each quarter, contingent on AAW's financial performance during that quarter. {Id. at\n518) For a few years, Ms. Sponaugle collected these bonuses. {Id. at 522-23) Then, in or\naroimd March 2014, when she began the process of separating firom and ultimately divorcing her\nhusband, she stopped taking the quarterly cash bonuses, under circumstances - and with\nresulting consequences - that are discussed thoroughly below. {Id. at 521-22; Sponaugle Trial\n4Tr. at 1283; see also infra at Part IV.D.5)\nB. AAW's Culture\nCertain features of the culture at AAW are pertinent to understanding how Ms. Sponaugle\nwas able to engage in her fraudulent scheme, how it went undetected for so long, and how the\nCourt is finding that the government failed to prove the extent of the fraud was anywhere near\nwhat the government (and AAW) alleged. The Court believes the characteristics of the culture\ndescribed in this Opinion are not disputed - although their impact is.'^ In any event, the Court's\nfindings regarding AAW's culture are strongly supported in the record, by at least a\npreponderance of the evidence.\nMs. Sponaugle testified, Drs. McCracken and McCullough agreed, and the Court finds\nthat the culture at AAW was \"incredibly generous,\" in the sense of monetary generosity and also\nin that the doctors, providers, other employees, and Ms. Sponaugle were deeply involved in one\nanother's lives. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1287-88; see also McCullough Trial Tr. at 641-42;\nMcCracken Sent. Tr. A at 205-07) AAW took special care to celebrate its employees through\nregular events like spa days, company parties, birthday celebrations, and special recognition\nweeks, all paid for at the expense of the business itself, and typically planned by Ms. Sponaugle\nas part of her job duties. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1288-93; Sponaiagle Sent. Tr. B at 192;\nMcCracken Sent. Tr. A at 206-07) For employees' important life events and milestones, such as\nretirements, graduations, baby showers, and weddings, AAW often provided gifts, including\nThe government agrees that the culture at AAW is relevant to the issues in dispute in this\nlitigation. {See generally Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 120 (\"[W]e [i.e., the government and FBI]\nlearned a lot about All About Women from the very beginning and the nature or the culture of\nthe practice.\"); id. at 136 (explaining that at start of investigation FBI was \"trying to leam the\nculture of the practice\"))\n5jewelry, as well as refreshments and food. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 604; McCullough Trial Tr.\n641-42; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1292-93; DXIS)^\nAAW's generosity extended to making contributions to charitable events, such as Toys\nfor Tots and walks to raise awareness of, and funds for, breast cancer research and treatment.\n(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1306-09) Ms. Sponaugle played a crucial role in these efforts as well.\nFor example, for an annual breast cancer walk in Philadelphia, Ms. Sponaugle was responsible\nfor renting a bus for all of the AAW-related participants, purchasing refreshments to serve on the\nbus, serving those refreshments, and cleaning up the bus afterwards. (Id. at 1306-08; Hoffinan\nSent. Tr. B at 12) She also helped the practice make donations, including of toys and clothes, to\ncharities. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1308-09)\nThe partners also contributed to employees' trips or other personal expenses, like home\nrepairs. {Id. at 1288) On at least one occasion the partners gave $2,000 towards an employee's\nDisney honeymoon trip. (Id. at 1288; McCullough Trial Tr. at 770; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at\n188,205-06; DX24)\nThe partners and the practice were particularly generous to Ms. Sponaugle, who by all\naccounts worked extremely hard at her job and whom the partners consistently rated as an\noutstanding employee. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 522-23; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1276) Examples\nabound in the record and the Court will list only some. The doctor-partners bought Ms.\nSponaugle Christmas and birthday gifts. (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 217-18) In 2009 or 2010,\nAAW paid for Ms. Sponaugle to take her then-husband and children to DisneyWorld for a week.\n^ Citations to Defendant's trial exhibits are in the format \"DX[number] at [page number].\"\nCitations to Defendant's sentencing hearing exhibits are in the format \"Def. Sent. Ex. [number]\nat [bates page number].\"(Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 225) In 2012, the practice paid for Ms. Sponaugle to take her family to\nGreat Wolf Lodge, an indoor water park. (McCullough Trial Tr. 671-72, 676; Sponaugle Trial\nTr. at 1383-84; DX23A) In 2015, the practice paid for Ms. Sponaugle and her then-husband to\ntravel to Mexico, in hopes the getaway would help them reconcile and preserve their struggling\nmarriage. (McCracken Trial Tr. 450-51; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1392; see also McCracken Sent.\nTr. A at 212-13,247,252) In 2016, the doctors sent Ms. Sponaugle to Canyon Ranch, a spa in\nMassachusetts, to \"refresh\" herself after she officially separated from her husband. (Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1402; McCracken Sent Tr. A at 142-43) One of the partners. Dr. McCracken, sent\nSponaugle a text message saying \"1 want you to think of this as an annual ritual,\" which\nconfirmed Ms. Sponaugle's impression that AAW would pay for an aimual trip to a spa (or to\nGreat Wolf Lodge, as a less expensive substitute). (Def. Sent. Ex. 31; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at\n142-43; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B. at 232) After her divorce, on at least one occasion, the practice\npaid for Sponaugle to hire a photographer to take pictures of herself and her children. (See\nMcCracken Sent. Tr. A at 213)\nThanks to AAW's enormously supportive and generous ciilture, Ms. Sponaugle\ndeveloped close relationships and friendships with its parmers, practitioners, and employees.\n(See, e.g., McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 242-44; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1509; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B.\nat 171-76) On multiple occasions. Dr. McCullough allowed Ms. Sponaugle and her family to\nuse her beach house in Avalon, New Jersey. (McCullough Trial Tr. at 721-22; Sponaugle Trial\nTr. at 1403) Ms. Sponaugle and some of the partners went together to a Taylor Swift concert in\nPhiladelphia. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 447) At other times, Ms. Sponaugle and at least some of\nthe doctors (and often their families) attended an Orioles game, a cookout party, a One Direction\nconcert, a Maroon 5 concert, and a company picnic together. (See, e.g., Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B.\n7at 171-76; see also Def. Sent Ex. 28)\nAnother facet of AAW's culture was that the practice was not particularly careful about\nhaving, or following, policies relating to financial expenditures. In connection with this case, the\nlack of enforceable controls was most evident in relation to the use of credit cards issued by (and\npaid for by) AAW to its partners and Ms. Sponaugle. While there was an employee handbook,\nAAW lacked clear written policies or guidelines regarding the use of the company credit cards.\n(Smith Trial Tr. at 871-73; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1249; McCracken Sent. Tr. A. at 44-45,232)\nAAW provided company credit cards primarily for the holders of the cards to use to pay\nfor gas and car maintenance expenses. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 426-29) Other business\nexpenses, like supplies or conference fees, could also be put on the card and charged to the\npractice. {Id. at 427-28) AAW did not have clear policies as to the amoimts that could be\ncharged to employees' AAW credit cards for these types of expenses. (Smith Trial Tr. at 873;\nSponaugle Trial Tr. at 1249-50; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 44-45) While AAW permitted its\npartners and employees who were on call at the hospital to use their company credit cards to pay\nfor car maintenance, that meant only \"routine maintenance\" or \"minor\" repairs, but what was\n\"routine\" or \"minor\" was undefined (and largely unenforced). (McCracken Trial Tr. at 426-29,\n559-60; Smith Trial Tr. at 864-65; Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1167-68) Given the lack of clear\npolicies, as well as the tremendous amount of trust the doctors placed in Ms. Sponaugle, on\nmany occasions when Ms. Sponaugle notified the partners that she put a personal charge on her\ncompany credit card, she was told to not worry about it. {See, e.g., McCracken Trial Tr. at 436;\nsee also Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1538-39)\nAt its peak, AAW had three offices, in Christiana, Pike Creek, and Glasgow. (Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1294-95) At this time, Ms. Sponaugle was involved in purchasing appliances, decor,\n8and other items needed for remodeling. (Jd.; McCulldugh Trial Tr. at 828) Ms. Sponaugle was\nalso expected to purchase supplies for the offices and staff, including keeping the doctors'\npersonal spaces stocked with their preferred snacks, drinks, and paper products. (Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1295-96) Ms. Sponaugle paid for all these supplies, as well as gifts, celebrations, and\nfurniture, with her company credit card. {Id.)\nFor the undersigned Judge, as a neutral, outside observer who has now had the benefit of\nobserving the testimony of many of the partners and Ms. Sponaugle (at length), it has been\ndifficult - and often impossible - to discem what credit card charges were authorized and what\ncharges were not. The Court suspects that in most employment contexts, this would not be a\nhard task: if a purchase is for a purely personal non-business-related item, it is not authorized; if\na boss told an employee something like \"you've been working hard, your marriage is on the\nrocks, you should take a vacation,\" the boss would not be thereby offering to pay for the trip.\nBut the record here shows that on many occasions Ms. Sponaugle was expressly permitted to\ncharge personal items to her AAW credit card, and on other occasions the practice paid for Ms.\nSponaugle to take vacations and other trips. It also demonstrates a lack of clear, enforceable\npolicies as to what was permitted to be charged on the company credit card. These findings have\ncontributed substantially to the Court's conclusions as provided throughout this Opinion.\nC. The Investigation And Prosecution\nOn February 26,2018, Ms. Sponaugle gave notice to AAW that she was going to be\nresigning from her position as CEO. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 418; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1502;\nsee also D.I. 73 at 5 (government pretrial memo suggesting it would prove \"the defendant\nabruptly announced that she was quitting her job at AAW\")) By this date, Ms. Sponaugle had\naccepted a position at another medical practice, located in the same building as AAW's primary\n9office. So Ms. Sponaugle arranged a meeting with the partners to inform them she would be\nleaving AAW. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1505-06) According to Ms. Sponaugle, the partners'\nreactions included shock, anger, and sadness. {Id. at 1506) Ms. Sponaugle told them that, even\nafter leaving AAW, she would remain available to assist with the transition to a new practice\nmanager over the following three months, including by offering to return to AAW's office to\nhelp a new person leam the role. {Id. at 1511; see also McCracken Sent Tr. A at 188)\nGiven Ms. Sponaugle's impending departure, the partners realized they would need to\ncover her responsibilities themselves, at least xmtil they were able to hire a replacement.\n(McCracken Trial Tr. at 461) Dr. McCracken took on temporary responsibility for handling\nAAW's finances. {Id.) To prepare for this role. Dr. McCracken asked Ms. Sponaugle to provide\nher access to AAW's credit card statements, bank records, and other financial information. {Id.\nat 458-59) Upon reviewing the statements. Dr. McCracken and the other partners became\nconcemed with many of the charges they saw that Ms. Sponaugle had charged to the practice.\n{Id. at 464) Dr. McCracken and some of her partners consulted with AAW's outside accountants\nat Stephano Slack LLC regarding what they found in the credit card statements and in\nQuickBooks. {Id. at 464-58) They discovered that Ms. Sponaugle had long been using her\nAAW credit card to purchase personal items and had apparently hidden these charges by\nmischaracterizing them in her entries in QuickBooks. (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 23,199)\nOver the ensuing days, the doctors gathered more information and consulted an attomey.\n{Id. at 199) Then, on March 8,2018, before her late-February resignation had become effective,\nAAW terminated Ms. Sponaugle for cause. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 544-45; Sponaugle Trial Tr.\n10at 1513-14)^ The termination occurred in a meeting Ms. Sponaugle had been told to attend so\nshe could explain how to use QuickBooks to Dr. McCracken. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1513)\nWhen Ms. Sponaugle arrived in the conference room, she foimd not just Dr. McCracken but all\nof AAW's partners, along with an attorney she had never met and Ralph Cetrulo, AAW's outside\naccountant, with whom Ms. Sponaugle had worked in keeping track of AAW's finances. {Id. at\n1513-15)\nThe attorney told Ms. Sponaugle she was being terminated for cause based on her\nunlawful use of her AAW credit card. {Id. at 1515) Despite having no notice of the true\npurposes of this meeting, and with no warning whatsoever that she was suspected of\nwrongdoing, Ms. Sponaugle had an immediate explanation for what the attorney was alleging.\nShe stated she had used her AAW credit card to make personal purchases in lieu of taking cash\nbonuses to which she would otherwise have been entitled, as the practice had agreed she could\ndo (so she said) because of her pending divorce proceedings. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1515;\nTermination Video at 3:50-4:43)^\nThe lawyer told Ms. Sponaugle she needed to turn over her cellphone, collect her\npersonal items from her office, and then leave the premises. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1514;\nTermination Video at 3:25-45) Her access to AAW's computer systems was shut off.\n(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1514) She was promptly escorted to her office to pack her belongings\n\u00ae While the Indictment alleges a fraud scheme that ran imtil on or about March 12,2018, it\nappears that the date of Ms. Sponaugle's termination was March 8,2018. {See Sponaugle Trial\nTr. at 1521; Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1104; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 197; see also Cucuzzella Trial\nTr. at 1207)\n^ The \"Termination Video\" is a recording made by Dr. Goshow-Harris during the March 2018\ntermination meeting; the defense played it during the sentencing proceedings. {See, e.g.,\nSponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 141-42)\n11and then a constable walked her out of the building and to her car. {Id. at 1515-17)\nThe AAW partners also filed a police report. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 544-45; see also\nWilson Trial Tr. at 376, 383) After an initial investigation by the Delaware State Police, the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") took over the case in the summer of 2018. (Wilson\nTrial Tr. at 349; D.I. 73 at 5-6) Among other investigative tasks, the FBI interviewed the doctors\nand sought to corroborate what they told the FBI. (Wilson Trial Tr. at 349-51) Investigators\ncollected information from TD Bank, where AAW had accounts, and from Groupon, Amazon,\nBJ's Wholesale, and Delmarva Power, and then analyzed the data in an effort to determine which\npurchases were authorized and which were not. {Id. at 354-57,370) The FBI conducted\ninterviews and acquired emails, messages, and other forms of communications as further aids to\ntheir analysis. {Id. at 371) Eventually, the FBI and United States Attorney's Office held a\n\"reverse proffer\" session with Sponaugle and her attorney, at which the government outlined its\ncase and shared some of its evidence; the government did not, however, hear any of Ms.\nSponaugle's explanations or her defense before deciding to charge her. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at\n1599-1602)\nOn August 15,2019, more than 18 months after she had been terminated, a federal grand\njury returned a one-count indictment, charging Ms. Sponaugle with wire fraud imder 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1343. {See generally D.I. 2; see also Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1521,1602-03) The Indictment\nalleges that Sponaugle devised and engaged in a six-year scheme to defraud AAW. Specifically,\nthe Indictment alleges that the scheme began on or about January 23,2012 and continued until\napproximately March 12, 2018. {See D.I. 2 at 2) The scheme involved Ms. Sponaugle using her\nAAW credit card to make personal purchases, paying the bills for her AAW credit card with\nfunds from AAW's bank account, and disguising her personal expenditures in AAW's financial\n12accounting system. {Id. at 1-2) The Indictment states that Ms. Sponaugle put over 2,100\nunauthorized charges on her AAW credit card, corresponding to total fraudulent expenditures of\napproximately $322,652. {See id. at 2)\nD. Trial\nThe Court held a pretrial conference on November 17,2021. The government had\npreviously filed a trial memorandum, which outlined the government's theory of the case and\npreviewed the evidence to be presented at trial. {See generally D.I. 73) The government did not\nidentify any particular niunber of fraudulent transactions, or an amount of fraudulent loss, it\nintended to prove.\u00ae\nAt trial, the government started its opening statement by telling the jury it would prove\nthat Ms. Sponaugle misused her AAW credit card at least 3,000 times. {See Trial Tr. at 309; see\nalso id. at 310-11,316,318-19) The AUSA said those \"3,000 swipes\" resulted in \"over a quarter\nof a million dollars\" in fraudulent charges on Ms. Sponaugle's AAW credit card. {Id. at 309; see\nalso id. at 310, 311 (\"himdreds of thousands of dollars\"), 316,319) Defense counsel, in his\nopening statement, countered that Ms. Sponaugle \"believed m good faith that the purchases that\nshe was making\" on her AAW credit card were authorized by the practice. {Id. at 320) Defense\ncounsel further explained that Ms. Sponaugle \"believed in good faith that she was permitted to\nrecoup the $20- to $30,000 per year that she did not take\" - that is, the cash bonuses she had\npreviously received - by making personal expenditures on her AAW credit card. {Id.) He also\ntold the jury that the defense would show that many of the 3,000 swipes referred to by the\ngovernment were authorized by the AAW partners. {See id. at 321)\n\u00ae The memorandum states generally that Ms. Sponaugle stole \"hundreds of thousands of dollars,''\nwithout specifying an estimate of loss or particular fraudulent credit card charges. (D.I. 73 at 2)\n13During trial, the government called seven witnesses: FBI Supervisory Special Agent\nJoshua Wilson, Dr. Alice Diane McCracken, Dr. Helen McCullough, Dr. Regina Smith, Ralph\nCetrulo, Kathy Storm, and FBI Forensic Accountant Michelle Hoffinan (\"Accoxmtant Hoffinan,\"\n\"Ms. Hof&nan,\" or \"Hoffinan\"). Special Agent Wilson and FBI Forensic Accoimtant Hoffinan\ntestified to the FBI's involvement in the investigation and, in particular, how Ms. Hoffinan\nanalyzed Ms. Sponaugle's purchases and determined which ones were imauthorized. {See\ngenerally Trial Tr. at 345-95,1029-1186) Drs. McCracken, McCullough, and Smith testified\nabout their work at AAW, AAW's culture, and how they discovered and assessed Ms.\nSponaugle's personal charges on the company credit card. {See generally id. at 404-563, 582-\n630,631-854, 855-81) Mr. Cetrulo, who was AAW's tax accountant, and Ms. Storm, another\naccountant who works with AAW, testified about their understandiag of AAW's accoimting\npractices, including the minimal oversight and lack of auditing. {See generally id. at 882-971,\n971-1028)\nThe defense put on an extensive case at trial as well. The defense called Dr. Anthony\nCucuzzella, Dr. Ann Kim, Dr. Scott Roberts, Carla Sayer, and Diane McWilliams as character\nwitnesses, who testified to Ms. Sponaugle's reputation for being honest, trustworthy, and\nlaw-abiding at work and in her community. {See generally id. at 1193-1222,1323-68,1469-76)\nThe defense also called Michele Allen, an employment attorney who had represented Ms.\nSponaugle after her termination from AAW. Ms. Allen described how her office had\ncommunicated with AAW's counsel in an attempt to work through the issues that led to Ms.\nSponaugle's termination, imtil she learned that AAW was not interested in negotiating. {See\ngenerally id. at 1616-23) The core of the defense case was Ms. Sponaugle's testimony on her\nown behalf, which lasted for more than a full day. {See generally id. at 1222-1322,1370-1454,\n141477-1614) Among other things, the Defendant explained her understanding of what she was\nauthorized to purchase and why she used her AAW credit card for personal items in lieu of\nreceiving her bonuses from October 2014 to her termination in March 2018.\nAfter all the evidence had been presented, the Court instructed the jury on the elements of\nwire fraud. First, the jury needed to find beyond a reasonable doubt that \"Kimberly Sponaugle\nknowingly devised a scheme to defraud or to obtain money or property by materially false or\nfraudulent pretenses, representations or promises.\" (Trial Tr. at 1666) On this first element, the\nCourt explained that the government was not required to \"prove every misrepresentation charged\nin the indictment,\" but rather it was \"sufficient\" if the government proved \"one or more of the\nmaterial misrepresentations.\" {Id. at 1668) The jiiry could not convict the Defendant unless all\njurors unanimously agreed \"as to at least one of the material misrepresentations.\" {Id.)\nSecond, the jury needed to find beyond a reasonable doubt that \"Kimberly Sponaugle\nacted with the intent to defraud.\" {Id. at 1666) An \"intent to defraud\" means \"to act knowingly\nand with the intention or the purpose to deceive or cheat.\" {Id. at 1670) The Court explained\nthat if Ms. Sponaugle acted in \"good faith,\" that would be \"a complete defense\" to the charge of\nwire fraud because it would be \"inconsistent with her acting with an intent to defiraud.\" {Id. at\n1678) For example, if Ms. Sponaugle \"made an honest mistake or had an honest\nmisimderstanding about whether and when she was authorized to put personal purchases on her\nbusiness credit card, then she did not act with an intent to defraud.\" {Id.)\nThird, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that \"in advancing, furthering, or\ncarrying out the scheme, Kimberly Sponaugle transmitted any writing, signal, or sound by means\nof a wire, radio, or television communication in interstate commerce ....\" {Id. at 1670) In\nconnection with this element of the offense, the Court further instructed: \"The government and\n15the defendant have agreed that the following fact is true: wire transfers made from All About\nWomen's business checking account to pay off the defendant's All About Women credit card\nthroughout the time period of the Indictment travelled in interstate commerce.\" {Id. at 1670)\nFinally, the Court explained that the \"loss amoimt, or the total amount of unauthorized\nexpenses, is not an element of wire fraud,\" so the jiiry did \"not need to agree on a total loss\namount to find the defendant guilty of wire fraud.\" {Id. at 1667)\nIn its closing argument, the government repeated its assertion that Ms. Sponaugle \"made,\nultimately, over 3,000 personal purchases, totaling well over a quarter of a million dollars,\" on\nher AAW credit card. (Trial Tr. at 1682) The government also reiterated that the jury was not\nrequired to \"decide exactly how much money the defendant ultimately stole.\" {Id. at 1685)\nRather, the government told the jury that it only had to \"agree on one time that she acted\" to\nimplement her scheme to defraud. {Id.)\nIn his summation, defense counsel argued that Ms. Sponaugle \"believed in good faith,\nbased upon her discussion with the physicians, and based upon her tenure at All About Women,\nthat she was permitted and authorized to use her [business] credit card for personal\nexpenditures.\" {Id. at 1703) According to the defense, those expenditures were intended to\nmake up for bonuses averaging about $21,000 a year, which Ms. Sponaugle did not take while\nshe was going through divorce proceedmgs. {See, e.g., id. at 1721-25) In the defense's view,\nbecause she did not have an intent to defraud, she could not be guilty of wire fraud. {See id. at\n1703, 1750-53)\nIn rebuttal, the government again emphasized that the jury did not \"need to decide on a\nfinal dollar amount that [Ms. Sponaugle] spent in order to find her guilty.\" {Id. at 1764) The\nAUSA also repeated that the jury had to agree on \"the three elements of the offense\" for only\n16\"one example of [Ms. Sponaugle] buying something personal and hiding it in QuickBooks.\" {Id.\nat 1766)\nAfter deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the single count of wire firaud.\n{See generally D.I. 89)\nE. Sentencing Proceedings\nOn December 17,2021, two days after trial concluded, the Court met with counsel in\nchambers to discuss how to proceed toward sentencing. {See generally T>.I. 100) The Court\ndiscussed with the parties their \"positions on the loss amoimt that will drive the sentencing\nguidelines range\" and \"whether the government intends to seek a sentence that would include\nimprisonment.\" {Id. at 2) When it became clear that there were disagreements between the\nparties on these matters, the Court moved the discussion into the courtroom and put its thoughts\non the record. {See id.) Among other things, the Court stated:\n... I wanted to have this discussion for my benefit to\nunderstand if there was agreement or disagreement on... what\ntype of sentence might be appropriate and... how to get to\ndetermine what the right sentence might be....\n[I]t seems clear to me there is a disagreement. ...\n... [I]n terms of loss amoimt, ... I think there [are] some\ncomplicated possibly legal and certainly I think factual issues\nabout the loss amount. ... I recognize the jury found guilt beyond\na reasonable doubt, and that the standard of proof at sentencing\nwill be lower, will only be a preponderance of the evidence, but the\nburden will be on the government to prove by a preponderance of\nthe evidence the loss amount.\nAnd then we talked about imprisonment. And I said, this is\nmy view as of today, that I am not at all certain that this is a case\n17where I will conclude that prison is warranted.\nNow, I say that also with the recognition, as I hope i[s]\nclear to counsel, that I will have an open mind. I don't have all the\ninformation that 1 will have after a sentencing hearing. There may\nbe victims who want to be heard. There may be evidence that is\nrelevant conduct that I did not hear at trial. There may be evidence\nthat was presented at trial that didn't necessarily make the impact\non me that it will when I focus as a fact-finder at a sentencing\nhearing. And I have no idea what the guidelines are going to be in\nthe end after whatever proceedings we have and whatever\narguments and whatever findings I make.\n{Id. at 5-6)\nOn January 24 and February 8,2022, the parties filed memoranda with their views on\nvarious issues relating to sentencing. (D.I. 105 & 106) The Court held a status teleconference\nwith the parties on February 11,2022, at which the government agreed that the Court is not\nlimited to the record created at trial as the basis for making findings of fact related to sentencing.\n{See Feb. 11,2022 Tr. at 12-13) (\"Feb. 11 Tr.\") Subsequently, the Court held evidentiary\nhearings on March 10 and 11 and April 4,2022. (D.I. 119,120,121) The parties filed\nobjections to the Probation Office's PSR and later, on April 25, the Court received another\nversion of the PSR. (D.I. 109,115) On April 28,2022, the Court heard victim statements and\ncharacter references and then heard oral argument on the objections to the PSR and other legal\nissues relating to sentencing. (D.I. 122)\nAs part of its sentencing submissions, the government provided detail on allegedly\nfiraudulent check purchases that, in its view, needed to be included in the total loss amount as\nrelevant conduct. (D.I. 105 at 17) The government had not presented the checks to the jiuy as a\nbasis for conviction. {See Feb. 11 Tr. at 28) (AUSA stating: \"All the jury heard about those\nchecks was ... an example of a check. .. But we didn't discuss it at length because it's relevant\n18conduct for sentencing.\") In particular, the government pointed to checks Ms. Sponaugle wrote\non the AAW business checking accoxmt for allegedly unauthorized personal purchases totaling\n$16,145. {Id.\\see also D.l. 109 at n.l) The government later updated the amount of\nunauthorized check payments to $16,266. (See D.l. 116 Ex. 1)\nOver the course of the sentencing proceedings, the government called Dr. McCracken\nand FBI Forensic Accountant Hoffman, both of whom took the witness stand, were placed imder\noath, and were examined by an AUSA, defense counsel, and the Court. The Defendant took the\nstand again and, likewise, was placed under oath and questioned by her attomey, by the\ngovernment, and by the Court. The defense also called to the witness stand Special Agent\nWilson and private investigator Richard Kilmon. All of these witnesses provided evidence the\nCourt relies on in this Opinion in making the necessary factual findings relating to the\nSentencing Guidelines and, ultimately, the appropriate sentence for Ms. Sponaugle.\nThe Court also heard from niimerous victims and character witnesses. These individuals\nwere permitted to speak from the podium (not the witness stand) and were not placed under oath\nand were not examined by counsel or the Court.^ The following victims, all of whom were\nassociated with AAW, provided statements: Dr. Joanne Goshow, Dr. McCullough, Dr. Natalie\nChavez, Dr. Molly Larkin, and Dr. McCracken. The following character witnesses provided\nstatements on behalf of Defendant: Dr. Tony Cucuzzella, Dr. Nancy Kim, Dr. Ann Kim, Dustin\nMoore, Carla Sayer, Diane McWilliams, Edward Henderson, and David Byrd.\nAt the conclusion of the April 28 hearing, the Court advised the parties that it intended to\nissue an Opinion addressing the pending objections to the PSR and setting the Guidelines range\n^ This is the Court's standard procedure for hearing from victims and character witnesses in\nconnection with a sentenciag.\n19it would use as the starting point for determining the appropriate sentence for Ms. Sponaugle.\n(Sent. Tr. D at 182) This is that Opinion. In the coming weeks, the parties will submit\nadditional sentencing memoranda. (See D.I. 105,106,124) A sentencing hearing is scheduled\nfor August 31,2022 at 10:00 a.m.\nThe Court fully recognizes that the sentencing proceedings in this case were unusual in\nmultiple respects, most prominently in their length. In no other case has the Court found it\nnecessary to hear more than a few hours of evidence in relation to disputed sentencing issues;\nfour days of sentencing hearings, particularly after a trial (as opposed to a guilty plea), are, for\nthe undersigned Judge, imprecedented. Yet, under the atypical circumstances presented to the\nCourt - and especially given the way the government chose to charge and litigate this case -\nthese extensive proceedings were necessary.\nFor reasons imclear to the Court, the Indictment does not identify even a single credit\ncard purchase transaction as being allegedly fraudulent. Instead, in the sole count of the\nIndictment, the grand jury alleges that the scheme to defraud was executed via the bank transfers\nMs. Sponaugle engineered; that is, the draws on AAW's checking account, by which AAW\nfunds were used to pay the AAW credit card bills. Had the government, instead, included\nmultiple counts of fraud, and in each one identified a specific purchase transaction or category of\npurchases as fraudulent, the Court (and the parties) would have entered the sentencing phase of\nthe case with a far soimder basis on which to assess the amount of damages. Charging decisions,\nof course, are within the broad discretion of the prosecutors, and it is not the Court's role to\nquestion the exercise of that discretion. The point, instead, is that the government's exercise of\nthis discretion can have serious consequences for sentencing, including, as in this case, the\n20imposition of substantial burdens on the Court, the Defendant, the victims, and even on the\ngovernment itself.\nDue to the choices the government made in litigating this matter, the guilty verdict does\nnot necessarily imply (i) that any specific purchase transaction was foimd by the jury to be\nfraudulent; (ii) that any number of purchase transactions, other than one, was foimd by the jury to\nbe fraudulent; or (iii) any loss amount, other than a nominal amount, due to the Defendant's\nfraud. As a result, the Court approached sentencing facing the following circumstances:\n- Knowing that the Defendant is guilty of a six-year fraud scheme that definitely\ninvolved at least one unauthorized credit card purchase and may have involved up\nto 2100 (or more) fraudulent purchases beyond that, but with no way to know\nwhich transaction or transactions the jury found fraudulent;\n- Having no help from the jury verdict as to the amoimt of loss, as the verdict form\nsought only a general verdict (i.e., a finding of guilty or not guilty) based on\ninstructions that the amount of loss was not an issue the jury need decide;\n- Learning that the government's position was that \"the loss amount compelled by\nthe jury's verdict included each of the defendant's personal, not specifically\nauthorized, purchases on her business credit card throughout the six-year fraud\nscheme\" (D.I. 113 at 1) - that is, all 2100-plus transactions;\n- Learning as well that the government would contend it has and/or could prove a\nloss amoimt of approximately $250,000, would advocate for a Guidelines Range\nof 57-71 months, and would ask the Court to incarcerate the Defendant, perhaps\nfor a long time (D.I. 100 at 2);\n- Being made aware that the defense's position was that no more than a single,\nunidentifiable credit card transaction was all the fraud that was necessarily\nimplied by the verdict (D.I. 106 at 3,14) and, of course, that the defense would\nargue for a lower Guidelines range and a sentence of no imprisonment;\n- Recognizing that the burden of proof was on the government, to prove the\npurported fraud loss by a preponderance of the evidence; and\nThe necessary implications of the verdict are discussed at length in the next section. See infra\nPartm.\n21Concluding, regrettably but unavoidably, that the Court would need a great deal\nof help from the parties - and, likely, need to hear a great deal of additional\nevidence - to make findings of fact, including credibility determinations, in order\nto resolve the multitude of material disputes the parties were presenting with\nrespect to the Sentencing Guidelines and, ultimately, the sentence.\n(See generally Feb. 11 Tr. at 3) (Court describing difficult situation before it)\nBefore turning to the resolution of the many challenging legal and factual issues\npresented by this case, the Court must address a letter it received from the U.S. Attorney's Office\nduring the sentencing proceedings. Both the filing and the contents of the letter are perplexing.\nBecause the letter might be read as suggesting that the Court engaged in unfair, and possibly\ngender-biased, questioning of the witnesses, and because the victims are entitled to an\nexplanation of what the Court was trying to accomplish with its examination,^^ the Court will\nrespond here to the letter.\nDr. McCracken testified at the first day of the sentencing proceedings (March 10) and\nwas examined by an AUSA, by defense counsel, and by the Court. (See McCracken Sent. Tr. A\nat 8-270) No doctor testimony was provided on the second day (March 11). Before the third day\nof the proceedings (April 4), the government wrote to advise the Court that the government\nAt least one victim-witness. Dr. McCracken, echoed the government's letter in her April 28\nvictim impact statement given in open court;\nAnd I was asked why the partners and I didn't just talk to Kim and\nwork it out. Frankly, as a victim, the questions and the manner in\nwhich they were asked were disparaging, and the experience as a\nwhole was infuriating. But I would do it 20 times again if it meant\nthat Kim would never be able to steal from another person.\n(McCracken Sent. Tr. D at 42) The Court does not discovmt these feelings, regrets that Dr.\nMcCracken experienced them, and understands that making the Court's perspective transparent\nin this Opinion may not help. Nevertheless, the Court is confident that any review of the record\nwill confirm that all the witnesses, including Dr. McCracken, were treated fairly.\n22would \"not call additional victim-witnesses\" because it could not do so \"without compromising\nits obligations imder the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771\" (\"CVRA\" or \"Act\").\n(D.I. 113 at 1) In the letter, the government invokes its duty imder the CVRA to use its \"best\nefforts to see that crime victims are ... accorded the rights\" set forth in the Act, including the\n\"right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" (D.I. 113\nat 2) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a)(8)) The government asserts that \"the questioning endured by\nDr. McCracken,\" from defense counsel and the Court, illustrates that other victims, if called to\nthe stand, could be \"expose[d]. .. to far-reaching credibility attacks and the suggestion that they,\nas victims, have somehow acted wrongly,\" thereby \"violating] the government's obligations to\nthese victims under the CVRA.\" (D.I. 113 at 2)\nThe Court well understands that the law requires the United States Attorney's Office to\nsupport victims, including by furthering their participation in the prosecution and sentencing\nprocess. See CVRA \u00a7 3771(a). Yet, while a victim is fiilly entitled to participate, to be heard,\nand to be treated with respect and dignity, that does not compel the Court or a jury to accept and\nagree with everything a victim contends. Consistent with due process and federal practice, any\nwitness called to the stand by a prosecutor to provide evidence to the factfinder as a basis for\nAlthough a defendant has no right under the Confrontation Clause or Due Process Clause to\ncross-examination during sentencing, see United States v. Green, 718 F. App'x 141,143 (3d Cir.\n2018), that does not necessarily bar a victim (or a defendant or anyone else) from choosing to\ntestify under oath and subjecting themselves to cross-examination, see United States v. Vazquez,\n532 F. App'x 277,279-80 (3d Cir. 2013) (evaluating adequacy of representation and finding it\nconceivable that defendant's attorney chose to permit defendant's testimony imder oath and\nsubject to cross-examination dtiring sentencing). See also United States v. Brown, 810 F. App'x\n105,108 (3d Cir. 2020) (permitting defendant to cross-examine victims at trial); Green, 389 F.\nApp'x at 148-49 (finding no error when District Court questioned victim as to preferred sentence\nand then imposed different sentence).\n23resolving a fact dispute is subject to cross-examination. See United States v. Owens, 484 U.S.\n554, 561 (1988) (\"Ordinarily a witness is regarded as subject to cross-examination when he is\nplaced on the stand, under oath, and responds willingly to questions.\") (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also United States v. Brown, 810 F. App'x 105,108 (3d Cir. 2020) (permitting\ndefendant to cross-examine his victims at trial).\nNothing in the CVRA, nothing cited by the government, and nothing the Court has foiond\nin the law obligates or even permits the Court to rely on untested testimony to resolve fact\ndisputes in favor of the government and then rely on those findings to deprive a crimioal\ndefendant of her liberty. This is all the more true in the instant case, in which the government\nrelies on Accountant Hoffinan, who in tum relied so heavily on the doctors' statements as to\nwhat transactions were and were not authorized. {See infra Part rV.D.2.C)\nNor can the government have been surprised that Dr. McCracken was subject to\nquestioning by defense counsel and the Court. At the February 11 status teleconference, defense\ncounsel advised the government that at the upcoming hearing \"there's going to be some\ncredibility issues with Dr. McCracken as well.\" (Feb. 11 Tr. at 6)^^ On the same call, the Court\ntold the parties it had completed an initial review of the written submissions relating to\nsentencing and found they \"reveal numerous factual disputes, particularly about loss amount,\nwhich will be material to determining the appropriate sentencing guideline; and on which not\nonly do I expect live testimony will be necessary on the assumption that the government still\nCounsel specifically mentioned that he might seek to question Dr. McCracken on issues\nrelating to certifications she made to the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a topic\ncalled out by the government's letter. (See Feb. 11 Tr. at 6) There can have been no surprise to\nthe government that this topic would be explored again at sentencing.\n24wishes to attempt to meet its burden of proof with respect to the loss amount, but / also expect to\nhave questions for whatever witnesses\" testify. (Id. at 3-4 (emphasis added); see also Sent. Tr.\nA at 6 (reminding parties that the Court would be examining witnesses))\nThere was no objection from the government to the Court's plan to examine witnesses or\nany reference at all to the CVRA imtil after two full days of sentencing proceedings had been\ncompleted. The Court ultimately examined, at length, all three of the key witnesses who\nprovided evidence during the sentencing proceedings - Dr. McCracken, Accountant Hoffinan,\nand Ms. Sponaugle - taking advantage of the opportunity to elicit direct, helpful evidence to aid\nthe Court in imdertaking the difficult tasks of assessing credibility, resolving fact disputes, and,\neventually, arriving at a fair and appropriate sentence.\nThe government's letter contains the following description of the Court's examination of\nDr. McCracken:\nThe Court, for its part, asked whether [i] Dr. McCracken believed\nthe circumstances of the defendant's termination were incredibly\ntraumatic for the defendant, and [ii] repeatedly suggested the\ndecision to report the defendant's fraud to the police was\npremature, and that [iii] the All About Women partners should\nhave tried to \"work out the situation\" by speaking with the\ndefendant. The Court also asked Dr. McCracken [iv] whether the\npartners responded to the defendant's resignation with \"anger,\nsadness, madness and crying,\" and [v] later asked her to confirm\nthat the practice was made up entirely of women. The government\ncannot ask additional victims to face such questioning in light of\nits obligations xmder the CVRA.\n(D.I. 113 at 2) (internal numbering added)\nAny suggestion of impropriety in this selective summary - that the Court was unduly\nfocused on gender and the emotional status of witnesses, that the Court treated Dr. McCracken in\na disrespectfiil manner, and that the government could not risk subjecting additional victims to\n25the same inappropriate treatment - is unfounded. As the transcript reveals, most of the questions\nhighlighted in the letter were asked as part of the Court's effort to assess the credibility of the\nDefendant, a crucial prerequisite to the Court's resolution of the many relevant factual disputes\nleft imanswered by the jury's general verdict. The Defendant had testified to certain points at\ntrial, and Dr. McCracken was the first fact witness with whom the Court could attempt to\nconfirm or deny aspects of that testimony. Accordingly, as the Court expressly told Dr.\nMcCracken at the begummg of its examination of her, \"[sjome of the things I'm going to ask you\nare based on what she [i.e., Sponaugle] testified to at trial... [a]nd I want to understand as best I\ncan whether you agree or disagree with them.\" (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 187; see also id. at\n186-87 (\"I recognize that you and your colleagues are victims here, and I understand from your\ntestimony how you feel. But as you probably understand, I have an important job I have to do.\nUltimately, I have to make a decision about the right sentence for Ms. Sponaugle. ... And so in\nthat regard I want to understand as best as I can what happened and what yom perspective is.\"))\nAn example of this relates to one of the topics identified in the block quote above from\nthe letter (i.e., what the Court marked as [iv] above). During trial, Ms. Sponaugle was asked if\nshe had \"observe[d] any reactions\" from the partners when she told them she was resigning firom\nthe practice. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1506) Her answer was that there were \"lots of reactions.\nThere was anger, there was sadness, there was, you know, crying and madness, and I was -1\ndon't know what I was expecting.\" (Jd.) (emphasis added) The Court, as part of its effort to\nunderstand if Ms. Sponaugle was truthful - in this specific instance and more generally - asked\nDr. McCracken about this testimony:\nTHE COURT: Now, she testified that the responses\nfirom the partners ranged or included anger, sadness, madness and\ncrying; is that true?\n26THE WITNESS: I don't recall any -1 don't recall any\ncrying.\nI'm sure there were a flood of emotions, but I don't recall\nany, like, responses that I would say would be exaggerated.\n(McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 191) By omitting all context, the government's letter creates the false\nimpression that the undersigned Judge made up the phrase \"anger, sadness, madness, and crying\"\nand was idly inquiring into the doctors' emotions. In fact, the Court was asking the witness\nabout the veracity of the Defendant's testimony and using the Defendant's own words to do so.^''\nThe same is trae of other quotes the letter seems to suggest made the Court's questions\ninappropriate. Compare Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1514 (Defendant testifying \"[i]t was incredibly\ntraumatic\" to be escorted to her office and told to pack up her belongings) with McCracken Sent.\nTr. A at 202 (Court asking: \"She testified that it was incredibly traumatic, did - do you have a\nview on whether it was incredibly traumatic to her?\");'^ compare also Sponaugle Trial Tr. at\n1275 (\"I also was in charge of all 65 or so employees and managing the day to day that went\nwith managing 65 employees. And we were all females. So it was 65 female employees as well,\nand everybody had, you know, life challenges.\"); id. at 1291 (\"[W]e were an office of 60, 65\nwomen.\") with McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 218 (Court asking: \"Ms. Sponaugle testified that all,\nshe said, 65 employees, I think, at the practice were women, but however many employees you\nhad, were they all women?\"). As is clear from the record, all the Court was doing here was\nproviding the government's witness the opportunity to challenge the reliability of the\nThe Court inadvertently switched the Defendant's phrase \"crying and madness\" and asked\nabout \"madness and crying.\"\nThis testimony relates to topic [i] in the block quote from the letter, as reproduced earlier.\nThis testimony relates to topic [v] in the block quote from the letter, as reproduced earlier.\n27Defendant's testimony.\nThe letter also criticizes the Court for inquiring multiple times about why the partners\nconcluded so quickly (in a matter of days after a 12-year working relationship) that Ms.\nSponaugle had committed a crime (topic [ii] in the government's letter, as noted above) and why\nthey did not give her an opportunity to explain herself (topic [iii] above). The Court did so not to\naccuse the victims of wrongdoing but, rather, to help the Court assess key components of the\ndefense's theory of the case. The defense had long maintained that the doctors in the practice\nwere so upset at Ms. Sponaugle's resignation decision (which came barely more than a week\nbefore the practice then decided to terminate her) that they immediately turned on her and,\nthereafter, denied that they had approved all sorts of generous arrangements which they had, in\nreality, approved. As defense counsel explained at a sidebar during the trial:\n... [M]y position is everjdhing was very smooth until she\nannounced she was leaving. She indicated there was sadness, there\nwas anger, there was surprise.\nPart of my theory is going to be there was some anger and\nthere was a rush to judgment based on this anger because she left\nthem in such a position.\n(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1507-08; see also Trial Tr. at 1733 (defense closing argument))\nAs with so many other issues, the jury was not asked to vote on whether this defense\ntheory had merit; the guilty verdict does not necessarily imply a rejection of it. The jury could\nhave easily concluded both that Ms. Sponaugle occasionally exploited AAW's generosity and\nthat the AAW partners intentionally misrepresented the extent of this exploitation.'^ Because of\nAs noted elsewhere, while the Court finds (as it must) that Sponaugle exploited AAW's\ngenerosity, the Court does not find that the partners intentionally misrepresented the extent of the\nexploitation. See, e.g., infraVdxtWl.\n28the way the government charged and tried this case, which left almost all of the factfinding work\nrelating to calculation of the loss amount to the sentencing process, and because so much of the\ndispute for purposes of sentencing rests in the \"gray areas\" between clearly authorized and\nclearly unauthorized expenditures, the Court required a wide-ranging set of sentencing\nproceedings to obtain the evidence it needed to make very difficult decisions.\nIt was for these reasons that the Court asked Dr. McCracken how quickly she and the\nother doctors had decided Ms. Sponaugle had done something wrong and whether they had\ntalked to her about their concerns. (See, e.g., McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 196-98; see also id. at\n201 (asking whether Defendant was given opportunity to explain herself at termination meeting))\nThe Court went on to acknowledge that the doctors' reaction had \"confused\" the Court. (See id.\nat 198) Rather than remain silently confused and risk making a decision based on a\nmisperception or error, the Court used its examination to leam more from the government's\nhand-picked, first-hand witness. She explained:\nTHE WITNESS; ... [I]t to us, was so - it was so\nobvious, there was no other explanation. All the partners were,\nyou know - we just were shocked. We were upset. We were\nappalled. We were, you know, blaming ourselves.\nI was blaming myself for not following my intuition, I\nthink, months before that and getting the data before that....\nAnd we were more concerned about, like, tipping her off\nand her hiding more or doing other things that we were just like\nwe're going to collect whatever information, we're going to get all\nour ducks in a row. We had to get our electronic health record\npersonnel to make sure that when we terminated her we could\nchange all the passwords immediately. You know, we were trying\nto, at that point, protect ourselves.\n(Id. at 198-99)\nThe Court returned to this topic near the end of its examination, noting it was \"striking to\n29me how much faith and confidence and trust and friendship and interrelated business\nrelationships\" existed between the doctors and the Defendant, but \"then within a two-week\nperiod after she says she's leaving, without talking to her[,] all of you collectively decide or\ncome to understand she's been stealing from [you] maybe all of this time.\" (Id. at 242) Dr.\nMcCracken's response included a respectful remark that this was \"probably not a fair\ncharacterization\" {id. at 242-43) and then the following:\nI don't believe Kim joined our practice with the intent to\nsteal from us.\n[But] I think that psychologically she got to a point where\nshe has justified it in her own mind that this is all okay and that\nI'm doing that because I deserve it and I'm doing it because,\nwhatever, the partners would want me to have it.\n... [W]hen I chose to get that information prior to her\nleaving - like, at that time we were still fiiends with her.\n... And so when we did get that log-in information and I\nsat there in my kitchen with Dr. Chavez and looked at that\ninformation, I mean I wanted to vomit. I was like this cannot be\nhappening, I cannot believe that this is happening. Because we\nstill - like even at that point, we still were like we trusted her.\nAnd from our perspective at that point, we wanted to\nprotect ourselves and protect the practice. And so we felt the best\nway to do that was gather all of the information that we can then\nlet Kim know that... she's terminated because of this information.\n{Id at 244-45)\nThe Court found these answers credible. The Court is entirely convinced that Dr.\nMcCracken and the other doctors see the events of this case in just the manner she described.\nBut this makes it all the more difficult to fathom why the government believes the Court should\n30not have asked these questions (the answers to which help the government), and how the\ngovernment can have concluded that the Crime Victims Rights Act would have been violated if\nthe government had called additional victims to provide more evidence (which may have also\nhelped the government).^\u00ae\nIn all events, the Court assures the victims that, consistent with their rights under the\nCVRA, their testimony and their views have been - and will continue to be - carefully and\nrespectfiilly considered by the Court.\nni. NECESSARY IMPLICATIONS OF THE JURY'S GUILTY VERDICT\n\"[A] guilty verdict, not set aside, binds the sentencing court to accept the facts necessarily\nimplicit in the verdict.\" United States v. Boggi, 74 F.3d 470,478-79 (3d Cir. 1996). \"When a\ncase involves a general verdict, establishing that the verdict necessarily determined any\nparticular issue is extremely difficult.\" United States v. Raia, 993 F.3d 185, 194 (3d Cir. 2021).\n\"A general verdict does not disclose whether the jury rejected all or only part of [defendant's]\ntestimony.\" Id. at 195. \"Whether a fact is 'necessarily implicit in the verdict' is a different\ninquiry from deterniining which facts the jury most likely believed.\" Id.\nAs applied here, the government argues that the jury verdict necessarily implies that the\njury found the Defendant committed all of the fraud alleged in the Indictment. (See D.l. 105 at\n9-12) That is, according to the government, the Court must find all of the following:\n(i) the Defendant's fraudulent scheme ran for at least six years, from January 2012 through\nThe government has the burden of proof at sentencing and it was for the government to decide\nwho to call to the witness stand and who not to call. The government's heavy reliance on\nhearsay - that is, its choice to convey to the Court the other doctors' recollections only by having\nDr. McCracken testify as to what those doctors told her - greatly undermined the probative value\nof the government's evidence. This reality is described fully below. {See infra Part rV.D.3)\n31March 2018; (ii) the Defendant always acted with an intent to defraud and never acted in good\nfaith, with respect to any of the approximately 3,000 credit card charges at issue; and (iii) in\nexecution of that scheme, the Defendant used her AAW credit card for personal expenditures,\nwithout authorization, those approximately 3,000 times, resulting in loss attributable to her fraud\nof around $250,000.i' (See, e.g., D.1.105 at 9-12)\nThe Court agrees with the government that the jury verdict necessarily implies the jury\nunanimously concluded that Ms. Sponaugle's fraudulent scheme lasted for six years. Based on\nthe Indictment, the verdict form charged Sponaugle with \"Wire Fraud from on or about January\n23,2012, through on or about March 12,2018.\" (D.I. 87)^\u00b0 The jury is presumed to have\nfollowed the Court's jury instructions, including the instruction that in order to convict the\nDefendant the jury had to unanimously agree that she committed all of the essential elements of\nwire fraud, which expressly includes having a scheme to defraud for the period set out in the\nIndictment. (See Trial Tr. at 1653-81 (jury instructions); D.I. 2 at 2) Accordingly, the jury's\nverdict necessarily implies that Ms. Sponaugle's fraudulent scheme lasted from about January\n2012 through March 12,2018.\nFrom this, the government argues: \"Because the jury found the defendant guilty of a six-\nyear scheme, and necessarily rejected the defendant's good faith arguments, every personal\npurchase on the defendant's credit card, except those explicitly authorized, are properly included\nAs noted in several places in this Opinion, the government's estimate of the loss amount\nattributable to fraud has fluctuated over tune. (See, e.g., infra IV.D.2.a)\nThe verdict form contained a single question, asking the jiuy: \"As to Coimt I, charging the\nDefendant with Wire Fraud from on or about January 23,2012, through on or about March 12,\n2018, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, we find the Defendant,\" followed by spaces to enter\nGuilty or Not Guilty. (D.I. 89)\n32in the loss amount at sentencing.\" (D.I. 105 at 10) Here, the Court disagrees. While the jury\nnecessarily found that the scheme existed for six years - that is, the Defendant had figured out by\nJanuary 2012 how to put an unauthorized purchase on her AAW credit card and have AAW pay\nfor it, and she continued to have the capability of doing the same through her last day at AAW in\nMarch 2018 - it does not necessarily follow that the jury also determined that she executed that\nscheme every day (or even more than once) or that she maintained a fraudulent intent each and\nevery day (or even more than one day) over the course of the six-year period. The verdict does\nnot necessarily imply that the jury found that Ms. Sponaugle never acted in good faith with\nrespect to any of the allegedly fraudulent transactions. Nor does it necessarily imply that the jury\nfoimd all of the allegedly fraudulent transactions were actually fraudulent.\nThe Court instructed the jury that in order to find Ms. Sponaugle guilty of wire fraud, the\njurors all needed to agree that she \"acted with the intent to defraud.\" (Trial Tr. at 1666) The\nCourt further instructed the jury that if it found Ms. Sponaugle acted in good faith, including\nbased on mistake, then she did not act with fraudulent intent and could not be convicted. (See\nTrial Tr. at 1678) The government argues that the jury's verdict necessarily rejected her good\nfaith and mistake arguments, given their inconsistency with the jury's determination that Ms.\nSponaugle \"acted with the intent to defraud.\" (D.I. 105 at 12)\nThe Court disagrees. Neither the law nor the Court's instructions to the jury required the\njury to make an \"all or nothing,\" \"up or down\" conclusion. Instead, the jury was entirely free to\ndecide that some of the allegedly fraudulent credit card transactions between 2012 and 2018\nwere fraudulent while others were not fraudulent. Likewise, the jury was free to find that for\nsome of the allegedly fraudulent transactions the Defendant acted with an intent to defraud while\nfor others, and perhaps many or even most, she acted with good faith, genuinely believing she\n33was authorized to put the charge on her AAW card (though maybe being mistaken on that point).\nSee Raia, 993 F.Sd at 195 (\"A general verdict does not disclose whether the jury rejected all or\nonly part of [a defendant's] testimony\nIn this regard, it bears emphasis that, as has already been noted, the Court instructed the\njury it could convict Ms. Sponaugle based on finding just a single transaction to be fraudulent, a\npoint the government made to the jury in both its closing argument and rebuttal. The Court\ninstructed the jury: \"It is sufficient if the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that one\nor more of the alleged material misrepresentations were made in furtherance of the alleged\nscheme to defraud.\" (Trial Tr. at 1668) (emphasis added) Based on this instruction, the\ngovernment argued to the jury ^'you have to agree on one time that she acted on\" her plan. {Id.\nat 1685 (emphasis added); see also id. at 1766) (arguing jury need agree only on \"one example of\nher buying something personal and hiding it in QuickBooks\")) The government's post-trial\ninsistence that the jury necessarily found all 2,100 or more transactions to be fraudulent sits\nuneasily next to its repeated invitations to the jury to convict Ms. Sponaugle based on as little as\na single instance of fraud.\nThe Court further instructed the jury that the loss amount is \"not an element of wire\nfraud\" and, hence, the jury did \"not need to agree on a total loss amount.\" (Trial Tr. at 1667)\nThe Court agrees with defense coimsel:\nThis was a case that dwelled in the gray area between what\nSponaugle understood and what the AAW partners understood\nregarding Sponaugle's authorized use of her corporate credit card\nover many years in the complete absence of any memorialized and\nwell-defined set of rules governing the use of the card by AAW.\n(D.1.106 at 15)\n34Accordingly, the govemment argued to the jury that it need not \"decide exactly how much\nmoney the defendant ultimately stole\" or \"decide on a final dollar amount\" that Defendant\nwrongfully expended. {Id. at 1685,1764) In light of these instructions and arguments, it cannot\nbe that the jury's verdict necessarily implies any particular loss amoimt - notwithstanding the\ngovernment's wholly unpersuasive argiiments to the contrary.\nFor its position, the govemment relies on United States v. Ali, 508 F.3d 136,141,151 (3d\nCir. 2007), in which the Third Circuit vacated a defendant's sentence and remanded for\nresentencing after the district court \"quarrel[ed with]... the duration of the fraudulent scheme\nand thus the appropriate loss amoimt associated with that scheme[;]\" the district court also\ndeparted downward, based on intent, when calculating the loss amoimt. In the instant case, the\nCourt is not committing similar errors. The Court accepts that the scheme to defraud lasted for\nsix years; the Court is not (at this point) addressing downward departures. More importantly, as\nexplained above, under the circumstances presented here, no particular loss amount follows from\na finding as to the length of the scheme.\nHere, the Court will, as the law requires, hold the govemment to its burden and apply the\npreponderance of the evidence standard to determiae the loss amount. In doing so, the Court is\ngiving fiill effect to the findings that are necessarily implied by the jury's verdict. But for all\nother facts, the Court is making its own findings based on its own evaluation of whether the\ngovemment has met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\nIt is impossible to discem from the general verdict which specific act or acts the jury\nunanimously agreed were executions of the Defendant's six-year scheme. See Raia, 993 F.3d at\n194. In the Court's view, the jury may well have - and, given how this case was tried, and given\nthe Court's findings throughout this Opinion - determined that as few as one, two, or a handful\n35of fraudulent transactions occurred, at various times during the six-year scheme. Regardless of\nthe nrimber of transactions the jury unanimously found fraudulent, it is impossible to tell from\nthe verdict which one or more specific transactions these were; thus, no credit card purchase was\nnecessarily the one (or among the ones) the jury decided was fraudulent. The Court defers to the\njmy's findings that the Defendant did not always act in good faith, and that she had a\nlongstanding scheme to defraud which she executed at least one time. But the jury was not\ninstructed, and common sense does not dictate, that the jury made an all-or-nothing\ndetermination on good faith, number of fraudulent transactions, or amount of loss attributable to\nfraud. The verdict is entirely consistent with finding she acted in good faith sometimes (perhaps\nmost of the time) and in bad faith on only a few occasions.\nFinally, a word on credibility. The Court asked the parties whether it was permitted to\nmake its own assessment of witness credibility for purposes of sentencing or whether, instead, it\nis required to make a presumption as to what the jury thought of credibility and then be bound by\nthose presumed findings. Both parties agreed that, in this context, the Court is permitted to make\ncredibility determinations, particularly concerning who to believe in connection with specific\ntransactions that were not litigated before the jury. For instance, the following colloquy occurred\nwith one of the AUSAs:\nCOURT: Do I, as the sentencing judge at an evidentiary\nproceeding, get to make credibility determinations or is it the\ngovernment's view that those determinations have already been\nmade by the jury?\nAUSA; Your Honor, of course it's within the Court's\npurview to make credibility determinations. However, those\ndeterminations can't infringe upon factual findings that are\nnecessarily implicit from the jury's verdict. So to the extent that\ntwo different witnesses contradicted each other on the subject\nmatter that really goes to the heart of the jury's verdict, I think that\n36decision has already been made. But if Your Honor is discussing,\nfor example, specific transactions for which there's documentation\nin that gray area that we were just discussing, I think that is\ncertainly an appropriate use of the Court's discretion.\n(Feb. 11 Tr. at 12-13)\nWith respect to credibility, all that is necessarily implied by the verdict is that the j\\uy did\nnot find the entirety of Ms. Sponaugle's testimony to be credible. On at least one transaction\n(and potentially, but iinknowably, many more), the jury had to have found that she acted with\nfiraudulent intent and not in good faith. The Court is boimd to accept that the jury disbelieved at\nleast some small portion of what Ms. Sponaugle testified.\nAs with the transactions, however, there is no way to identify the specific point(s) on\nwhich the jury determined Ms. Sponaugle was not being truthfial. Accordingly, the Court has\nfound it necessary to make credibility determinations relating to all of the fact witnesses who\ntestified before it, as the parties agreed the Court is free to do.^^\nThe Court believes that the jury may have found Ms. Sponaugle credible on many points\nthat were in dispute and may well have found that she committed fraud on only a few occasions.\n^^See also United States v. Moment, 750 F. App'x 68,71 (3d Cir. 2018) (rejecting argument that\nDistrict Court erred in making determination of drug quantity - an issue on which government\nbore burden - during sentencing, adding \"[f]ar from usurping the jury's authority to make\ncredibility determinations, the District Court properly acknowledged different evidentiary\nstandards in different contexts\"); United States v. Merlino, 349 F.3d 144,159 (3d Cir. 2003)\n(explaining that sentencing judge did not have to accept all of witness' testimony for purposes of\nsentenciag; \"a court is not bound by testimony simply because it came from a witness the jury\nbelieved in some - or, indeed, more than some - respects\"); United States v. Haut, 107 F.3d 213,\n221-23 (3d Cir. 1997) (rejecting District Court's \"theory that a trial court is empowered to make\ncredibility determinations 'for sentencing purposes'\" when in aid of making downward departure\nnot authorized by Guidelines, but adding that \"when the severity of the sentence is calibrated to a\nfact that was related to the court by an Loherently suspect witness [such as an addict-informant],\nthe court can take the credibility of the witness into account at sentencing\") (citing United States\nV. Miele, 989 F.2d 659 (3d Cir. 1993)).\n37As explained throughout this Opinion, the Court - having observed Defendant testify at length at\ntrial and then observed her provide additional lengthy testimony during the sentencing\nproceedings, including imder examination from the Court - found Ms. Sponaugle to be highly\ncredible on almost every point now at issue in connection with sentencing. This credibility\nfinding, which the Court is free to make, has impacted the Court's assessment of whether the\ngovernment has met its burden of proof, particularly with respect to the amount of loss.\nOther conclusions concerning what is necessarily implied by the jury's verdict, and what,\ntherefore, the Court must accept as true for purposes of sentencing, are included throughout this\nOpinion.\nrV. OBJECTIONS TO THE PSR\nOnly the Defendant objected to the March 3,2022 version of the PSR. (See D.I. 109)\nBoth parties' written arguments relating to the objections, as well as the USPO's views, are\ncontained in the Probation Office's April 25,2022 revised version of the PSR. (See D.I. 115 at\n18-33) The Court heard argument on these objections as part of the April 28 sentencing\nproceedings. Below the Court sets out its rulings and reasoning with respect to the objections.\nA. The Defendant Abused A Position Of Trust\nSentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.3 provides: \"If the defendant abused a position of public or\nprivate trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or\nconcealment of the offense, increase [the offense level] by 2 levels.\" Pursuant to this Guideline,\nthe PSR recommends adding two levels to Defendant's offense level (see D.I. 115 at 7), which\nthe government supports (see id. at 28-29). Initially, Defendant did not oppose this two-level\nenhancement. (See D.I. 106 at 3) However, by the conclusion of the proceedings relating to\nsentencing. Defendant objected, although only weakly. (See, e.g., Sent. Tr. D at 134-35)\n38The Guidelines explain that this enhancement applies to a position of public or private\ntrust that is \"characterized by professional or managerial discretion\" because individuals in such\npositions \"ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision.\" SG \u00a7 3B1.3 cmt. n.l; see also\nUnited States v. Douglas, 885 F.3d 124,133 (3d Cir. 2018) (en banc) (\"[W]hen determining if\nthe defendant occupied a position of trust, we will ask whether the defendant had the power to\nmake decisions substantially firee firom supervision based on (1) a fiduciary or fiduciary-like\nrelationship, or (2) an authoritative status that would lead his actions or judgment to be\npresiunptively accepted.\"). The enhancement applies only if the position of trust \"contributed in\nsome significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense.\" SG \u00a7 3B1.3\napp. n. 1. This requirement is met if, for example, the position of trust makes \"detection of the\noffense or the defendant's responsibility for the offense more difficult.\" Id.\nThe government has established, by well more than a preponderance of the evidence, that\nDefendant abused her position of private trust - that is, her role as CEO of AAW. Specifically,\nMs. Sponaugle was entrusted by the partners of AAW with overseeing and managing all of\nAAW's finances, including paying the practice's credit card bills and keeping track of each\npartner's contribution to the profits and expenses of the practice. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 410,\n420-21) The doctors, imderstandably, wanted to focus their time on providing treatment to the\nthousands of patients who entrusted AAW with their medical care. To ensure the doctors had\ntime to be doctors, they turned all management responsibility over to Defendant. While\nDefendant consistently received outstanding reviews for her performance as CEO,^^ and the\nSee McCracken Trial Tr. at 522-25 (\"Q: And would it be fair to say that she commonly and\nconsistently got top marks as far as her routines with outstanding performances?

Defendant could not\nhave devised and implemented her firaudulent scheme without being in a position of private trust\nwithin AAW. Accordingly, Defendant's abuse of her position as CEO significantly facilitated\nthe commission of her offense, warranting application of the two-point enhancement.\nThe government further argues that Defendant abused her position of trust to conceal her\noffense. The Court finds that the government failed to prove this contention by the required\npreponderance of the evidence.^^ It is true that several of AAW's partners testified, at trial and at\nthe sentencing proceedings, that Defendant was the only person at AAW with access to the\npractice's credit card statements, bank accoimt statements, and internal QuickBooks records.\n(See, e.g., McCullough Trial Tr. at 730; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 90) The jury's guilty verdict\ndoes not \"necessarily imply\" that the jury found the government proved concealment beyond a\nreasonable doubt Instead, the jury merely had to find that at least one credit card transaction\nthe Defendant charged to AAW was unauthorized (making the false representation that it was\nDuring Ms. Sponaugle's tenure, the practice grew from five to 17 providers, to three offices,\nand to about 60 total staff. (McCullough Trial Tr. 704-05) (\"Q: And during the time Kim was at\n[AAW], is it fair to say that the practice experienced successful growth? A: We did.\");\nSponaugle Trial Tr. at 1259,1297)\nThe weakness of the government's evidence of concealment is discussed more fully later in\nthis Opinion. (See infra Part IV.D.7.e)\nWhen instructing the jiuy, the Court stated that concealment was not an element of the\noffense, but that \"concealment of material facts ... may constitute false or fraudulent\nstatements\" in connection with a \"scheme to defraud [that] was carried out by making false or\nfraudulent representations.\" (Trial Tr. at 1668)\n40authorized), whether or not she took steps to conceal such transaction(s).\nNevertheless, for the reasons set out in this section, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's\nobjection and will add the two points for abuse of a position of trust.\nB. The Government Failed To Prove Defendant Perjured Herself\nSentencing Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1, \"Obstructing Or Impeding The Administration Of\nJustice,\" provides:\nIf (1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted\nto obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to\nthe investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense\nof conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the\ndefendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B)\na closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.\nApplying this Guideline, the Third Circuit has explained that a defendant \"who testifies under\noath at trial commits peijury within \u00a7 3C1.1 if he [1] gives false testimony [2] concerning a\nmaterial matter [3] with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of\nconfusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\" United States v. Napolitan, 762 F.3d 297,312 (3d Cir.\n2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[T]he application of the obstruction of justice\nenhancement for peijury based on facts implicit in a guilty verdict have involved testimony that\nall but stated an element of the offense.\" Raia, 993 F.3d at 194, see also United States v. Gray,\n942 F.3d 627, 630,632-33 (3d Cir. 2019) (upholding enhancement for peijury where defendant\ntestified he did not have gun and was then convicted of unlawful possession of firearm); United\nStates V. Johnson, 320 F.3d 139,144,153-53 (3d Cir. 2002) (upholding enhancement where\ndefendant testified that drugs did not belong to him and was then convicted of possession with\nintent to distribute drugs).\nThe PSR recommends applying this enhancement based on Ms. Sponaugle's testimony\n41that she believed \"with [her] whole heart\" that she could use her company credit card for\npersonal purchases in lieu of her bonus payments. (See D.L 115 at 5) The government joins in\nthe USPO's position and also broadens the bases for application of this enhancement, arguing\nthat Ms. Sponaugle's testimony regarding her personal purchases on the company credit card,\nher QuickBooks mis-categorizations, and her statements proclaiming her innocence at the\nsentencing hearings were inconsistent with the jury's verdict. (See id. at 21-24) Defendant\nobjects to application of this Guideline on the basis that her testimony was not false, material,\nand willfiil and is also not irreconcilably inconsistent with the jury's verdict. (See id. at 18-21)\nThe Court finds that the government did not prove, by the requisite preponderance of the\nevidence, that this Guideline is applicable. The record, as a whole, does not support the\ngovernment.\nDefendant writes, persuasively in the Court's view:\nan obstruction ofjustice enhancement should not apply since the\nverdict cannot be interpreted as a complete rejection of Ms.\nSponaugle's testimony given the very general way the offense\nconduct covering over 2,100 credit card transactions was alleged in\nthe Indictment and since, as per the Court's Final Jury Instructions,\na single unauthorized transaction proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was sufficient to support a ^ding of guilty as to the Wire\nFraud charge. The jury's verdict cannot be interpreted as a blanket\nrejection of all of Sponaugle's trial testimony regarding what she\nclaimed was her good faith use of her AAW corporate credit card\nto offset her quarterly, Christmas, and summer bonuses that she did\nnot take when going through her divorce.\n(D.1.106 at 3-4)\nMs. Sponaugle's testimony that she \"believed with [her] whole heart, that... [she] could\nbe using the credit card for [her] personal purchases in lieu of receiving bonus money\"\n42(Sponaugle Trial Tr. 1312) was not necessarily false testimony Her statement does not state\nan element of the offense and does not necessarily conflict with the jury's verdict. Instead, the\njury could have believed that she acted in good faith in taking her bonus money through personal\ncredit card expenditures, but foimd an intent to defraud in relation to the amounts exceeding a\nreasonable calculation of her bonuses. Additionally, or alternatively, the jury could have found\nthat the only fraud Defendant committed was in the 2012 through October 2014 period, before\nshe stopped taking bonuses (i.e., that she only executed the scheme one or more times, all prior\nto October 2014, and thereafter maintained the scheme but never executed it). If that was how\nthe jury viewed the evidence, then it would follow that the jury believed that Ms. Sponaugle\nbelieved, with her whole heart, that she could put personal charges on her credit card instead of\ntaking bonuses for a large portion of her scheme (i.e., after October 2014).\nMs. Sponaugle testified at great length, at both the trial and at the sentencing\nproceedings. Her testimony stretches over approximately 733 transcript pages. {See Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1222-1322,1370-1469,1477-1614; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 155-252; Sponaugle\nSent. Tr. C at 6-306) Of this, 167 pages were cross-examination by the government and another\n48 were examination by the Court. {See Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1524-1600; Sponaugle Sent. Tr.\nC at 143-214,218-38,244-92) On many, many points, Ms. Sponaugle had credible, plausible,\nand persuasive explanations. {See, e.g., infra \u00a7 rV.D.2.e) While it is true that on a few occasions\nAs explained in further detail below, the Court finds that Ms. Sponaugle reasonably believed\nshe was authorized to use her AAW credit card to charge approximately $70,000 of personal\nexpenses during the period she was not taking cash bonuses. {See infra Part IV.D.5)\n43she denied ail wrongdoing, and in that respect could be found to have denied one or more of\nthe elements of the offense she was foimd guilty of, the manner in which this case was tried (i.e.,\nthe government claimed thousands of fraudulent transactions but told the jury, consistent with\nthe jury instructions, it need only find a single instance of fraud) coupled with the extent (and\noverall credibility) of her testimony, lead the Court to find that the government failed to prove it\nis more likely than not that she had a willful intent to provide false testimony.\nAt bottom, the Court is firmly of the view that Defendant's testimony was not intended to\n\"obstruct\" or \"impede\" justice but, rather, to explain her generally reasonable view of events to\nthe factfinders. Her denial of guilt does not amoimt to pequry. The jury's verdict does not\nnecessarily imply that Defendant peijured herself at trial. The jury necessarily found that\nDefendant conceived of a scheme to defraud AAW and executed that scheme on at least one\noccasion. The jury was not required to - and there is no reason to believe it did - make a\nsingular, globally-applicable assessment of the totality of her testimony. Nor did the jury need to\nfind that she lied, so long as the jurors found (as they are presumed to have done) she had an\nintent to defraud and executed a scheme to defraud on at least one occasion.\nFor these reasons, the Defendant's objection to enhancement of her offense level based on\npeijury is SUSTAINED.\nC. The Government Failed To Prove The Offense \"[Rjesulted In Substantial\nFinancial Hardship\" To Any Victim\nSentencing Guideline \u00a7 2B1.1 provides that if the offense \"resulted in substantial\nfinancial hardship to one or more victims, increase [the offense level] by 2 levels,\" and if it\nAt the sentencing hearing, Ms. Sponaugle testified \"I didn't steal any money,\" \"I was not\ntrying to hide it. I never tried to hide a penny of it,\" and \"I didn't know I was doing a dam thing\nwrong. I would have never done it.\" (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 230-35)\n44\"resvilted in substantial financial hardship to five or more victims, increase [the offense level] by\n4 levels.\"\nIn determining whether the offense resulted in substantial financial hardship to a\nvictim, the court shall consider, among other factors, whether the offense resulted\nin the victim (i) becoming insolvent; (ii) filing for bankruptcy under the\nBankruptcy Code; (iii) suffering substantial loss of a retirement, education, or\nother savings or investment fund; (iv) making substantial changes to his or her\nemployment, such as postponing his or her retirement plans; (v) making\nsubstantial changes to his or her living arrangements, such as relocating to a less\nexpensive home; and (vi) suffering substantial harm to his or her ability to obtain\ncredit.\nSG \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n.4(F). \"[VJictim\" includes both \"individuals\" or \"partnerships\" who sustained\n\"any part of the actual loss determined.\" Id. at app. n.l. \"Actual loss\" includes \"the reasonably\nforeseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\" Id. at app. n.3(A)(i). To determine\nif one or more victims suffered a \"substantial financial hardship,\" the district court draws\ninferences based on a variety of facts to construe the loss \"relative to each victim.\" United States\nV. Paulson, 871 F.3d 261,268-69 (3d Cir. 2018).\nThe government argues that the four-level enhancement applies because AAW and each\nof the six AAW partners are victims. {See D.I. 115 at 25-27; D.I. 116 at 2-3)^^ The PSR agrees\nwith the government. Defendant objects, responding that no enhancement is warranted since\nAAW is the only victim and even AAW did not suffer substantial financial hardship. {See D.I.\n115 at 24-25) Based on the record, the Court finds that no enhancement has been proven to\napply because the offense did not result in substantial financial hardship to any potential victim,\nregardless of whether AAW is the sole victim or whether the six partners also count as victims\nThere were different numbers of partners at different times; six is the number of partners\nAAW had over the course of Sponaugle's fraudulent scheme between 2012 and 2018. {See D.I.\n115 at 26) (identifying six partners at AAW during Ms. Sponaugle's fraud scheme)\n45for purposes of this Guideline.\nUnder the Guidelines, a business entity and its owners can count as separate victims if\neach sustains part of the actual loss. See, e.g.. United States v. Kennedy, 554 F.3d 415,418-23\n(3d Cir. 2009) (recognizing that individual beneficiaries of 34 accounts from which defendant\nstole could potentially each he victims, but finding they were not because each was reimbursed\nfor any loss); see also United States v. Scarfo, 2022 WL 2763761, at *50 (3d Cir. July 15,2022)\n(rejectidg as \"spectacularly wrong\" argument that shareholders were not victims, where evidence\ndemonstrated that shareholders were deprived of normally expected payments).\nHere, the Court need not decide the question of whether AAW and its partners count as\nvictims for purposes of SG \u00a7 2B1.1 because the enhancement would not apply iu either event.\nWhether AAW alone is the victim or whether the six partners (alone or with AAW) are victims,\nthe enhancement only applies if the offense resulted in \"substantial financial hardship to a\nvictim.\" SG \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n.4(F). Determining whether \"substantial financial hardship\" exists\n\"is subject to the usual - and significant - degree of discretion afforded a district court during\nsentencing.\" United States v. Paulson, 871 F.3d 261,268 (3d Cir. 2017); see also generally\nConcepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. , 142 S. Ct. 2389 (2022). The government failed to\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that Ms. Sponaugle's offense resulted in substantial\nfinancial hardship to AAW or to any of its partners.\nDr. McCracken testified that the partners had to decrease their salaries in 2016 and 2017,\nand subsequently had to stop paying themselves a salary in 2019 - all of which she attributed to\nMs. Sponaugle's fraud and failure to pay AAW's debts. (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 19-21) Dr.\nMcCullough provided a letter to the Court (D.I. 127; see also McCullough Sent. Tr. D at 8-16)\ncontending that Defendant's fraud destroyed the practice's solvency and deprived her of\n46hundreds of thousands of dollars. Similarly, at the podium (not under oath and, therefore, not\nsubject to cross-examination), in victim impact statements, Drs. Goshow, Larkin, and Chavez, as\nwell as again McCullough and McCracken, alleged that Ms. Sponaugle's actions caused AAW to\nnearly collapse and come to the brink of bankruptcy.^\u00ae\nWhile the Court respects that the victims of Ms. Sponaugle's fraud believe that her\ncriminal conduct caused all of this financial harm, the record does not support them.^^ The\ngovernment failed to prove that AAW's business troubles were caused by Sponaugle's fraud.^^\nInstead, there is a complete mismatch between the scale of the alleged fraud - even on\nthe government's most ambitious assessment - and the size of AAW. The greatest amount of\nfraud the government has ever alleged (as far as the record reveals) was approximately $350,000\nThe Court makes no fihding on the doctors' further contention that Ms. Sponaugle's fraudulent\nconduct impacted the healthcare AAW was able to provide its patients. (See generally Sent. Tr.\nD at 7-10) Even if tme, this would not constitute \"substantial Randal hardship\" to AAW or the\npartners. In saying all this, the Court is not at all minimizing the profoimd, non-fimancial impacts\nof Ms. Sponaugle's fraud. (See, e.g., McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 240 (\"[I]t affected us in ways\nbeyond just the money.\"); id. at 255 (\"It's changed how we practice medicine. It's changed how\nwe trust people. It's changed how we hire... new employees.\")) For purposes of the SG\n\u00a7 2B1.1 analysis, however, all that matters is the financial harm. See SG \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n.3\n(explaining that \"loss\" is defined in terms of \"pecuniary harm,\" meaning \"harm that is monetary\nor that otherwise is readily measurable in money,\" and \"does not include emotional distress,\nharm to reputation, or other non-economic harm\").\nThe jury's verdict does not necessarily imply any finding that Defendant's fraud caused any\nsubstantial financial hardship, to AAW or any of its partners.\nIt is not even clear that the government tried to prove that Sponaugle's fraud had a large\nfinancial impact on AAW (or its partners). The government expressly represented that it was\nneither adopting nor endorsing all of the allegations made by AAW, its former partners, or any\nother victim. (See, e.g.. Sent. Tr. D at 171) The government's argument for substantial financial\nhardship appears, instead, to tum on the absolute dollar amount of the loss (with no context for\nthe amount of revenue flowing through AAW), which the government's final position for\nsentencing was $241,893.89 for AAW as a whole. (See D.I. 116 Ex. 1)\n47over six years. (See Hof&nan Sent. Tr. C at 104) While the Court is not persuaded that that the\namount of loss attributable to the fraud is nearly this much (see infra Part IV.D.7), even if it\nwere, $350,000 - while obviously a great deal of money - was not a big enough loss to tum\nAAW from a thriving financial success to a nearly bankrupt calamity. To be more precise, the\ngovernment failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an average annual loss from\nfraud of around $60,000 for each of six years truly threatened to bring down AAW.\nEvidence in the record shows that AAW's monthly expenditures were close to $550,000,\nor roughly $6.6 million each year. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 135; see also GX2a-q^^) Annual\nrevenues appear to have been in the $7 million range. (See Trial Tr. at 333; see also GX2a-q) It\nis difficult to imderstand how Sponaugle's alleged additional, unauthorized spending of $60,000\nfor each of six years, when added to the $6.6 million the practice was legitimately expending\neach year, could have resulted in any substantial financial hardship to AAW. The government\ncertainly did not prove any such impact on AAW.\nThe argument for application of this enhancement is further undermined by the presence\nof alternative, plausible explanations for the negative financial performance (at times) of AAW.\nPrincipally, most of the adverse results identified by the doctors followed Ms. Sponaugle's\ndeparture from the practice. If the practice suffered financial harm because its longtime CEO\nleft, and because the duties she performed had to be performed by others (who maybe were not\nas good at these tasks as Defendant was), that harm would not be attributable to fraud. Similarly,\nthe doctors fault Ms. Sponaugle for leaving large bills unpaid and complain that hundreds of\nthousands of dollars of invoices were due (or overdue) soon after her March 2018 termination.\n\"GX\" citations are to the government's trial and sentencing exhibits.\n48(See, e.g., McCracken Sent. Tr. A 20-21; McCuIlough Sent. Tr. D at 11 (\"We would ultimately\ndetermine that she had left us with approximately $350,000 of unpaid invoices.); Chavez Sent.\nTr. D at 18-19; Larkin Sent. Tr. D at 24) But financial harm that resulted from merely deficient\njob performance by Ms. Sponaugle would not be attributable to fraud.^\"^\nThere is also a failure of proof with respect to how any losses suffered by the partners\nindividually could have amounted to substantial financial hardship to any of them. Assuming it\nis fair to treat the (at most) $350,000 over six years as loss to each of six partners,^^ nothing in\nthe record supports a finding that the loss of an average of approximately $60,000 by each\npartner over a period of six years - equal to an average annual loss of around $10,000 per partner\n- constituted or caused a substantial financial hardship to any of the doctors. The limited\nevidence in the record about the doctors' salaries and net profits as partners strongly suggests\nthat a loss of income of $10,000 per year - while a terribly unfortunate loss that no one should\nhave to suffer - was not a substantial financial harm to any of them. (See, e.g., GX2a-q) No\nevidence was presented to the effect that any of the partners suffered the kind of financial harm\nidentified in the note accompanying the Guideline: insolvency or bankruptcy, \"substantial loss\"\nAdditionally, Ms. Sponaugle testified that AAW's income declined when the providers\ndecided to work fewer hours, particularly after obtaining more flexibility when AAW became\nindependent from ChristanaCare in 2012. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 126-30,137-40) This could\nexplain some of the income issues the doctors experienced even prior to discovering Ms.\nSponaugle's fraud. The Court need not make a finding on this point.\nIf the Court were to find that AAW suffered a loss of $350,000, the Court could not\nsimultaneously find that the six partners collectively suffered the loss of the same $350,000.\nThat would be double counting. See United States v. Moore, 315 F. App'x 16,18 (9th Cir. 2008)\n(\"To avoid double-counting, the individual account owners and the banks who reimbursed them\ncannot both be victims on the basis of the same stolen funds.\"); see also United States v. Nathan,\n188 F.3d 190,210-11 (3d Cir. 1999) (finding District Court erred by double coxmting loss to Air\nForce for cancelled settlement agreement and re-procurement). Since the government's efforts\nto support the victim enhancement fail on other grounds, the Court need not reach this issue.\n49in a retirement or other type of savings or investment fund, harm to the ability to obtain credit, or\nthe need to make substantial changes to employment, retirement, or living arrangements. While\nthe note's list is not exhaustive, see SG \u00a7 2B1.1 (stating that Court \"shall consider, among other\nfactors, whether the offense resulted in\" the six listed items), no evidence was presented of any\nsimilar type of substantial financial harm suffered by any of the doctors that was attributable to\nMs. Sponaugle's fraud.^\u00ae\nAccordingly, the Defendant's objection to the victim enhancement of SG \u00a7 2B1.1 is\nSUSTAINED.\nD. The Loss Amount Proven By The Government Is Between $40,000 And $95,000\nThe biggest factor in calculating the applicable Guidelines range is the amount of loss\nattributable to Defendant's fraud. The government's position is that it proved at least\n$241,893.89 of loss, which would translate into an additional 10 points to Defendant's offense\nlevel. The PSR agrees with the government. Defendant's position is that she is responsible for\nno loss, so no points should be added to her offense level.^^\nAt trial, the jury saw evidence of each partner's \"column,\" a complex system (designed by Mr.\nCetrulo) through which Ms. Sponaugle was to track the partners' quarterly allocated receipts and\nexpenses. {See, e.g., McCracken Trial Tr. at 430-31; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 62, 65-66;\nCetrulo Trial Tr. at 940-42; Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1438-40) There was some evidence that a\nmischaracterization in QuickBooks of a Sponaugle unauthorized personal expense could end up,\nwrongly, as an expenditure from one of the partners' columns, causing a financial loss to that\ndoctor. {See, e.g., Hofi&nan Trial Tr. at 1045-46; Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 135-36; Sponaugle\nSent. Tr. C at 264,266-68; GX109) The government did not attempt to prove this type of direct\nfinancial loss to individual partners based on specific transactions and does not argue it as a basis\nto support application of the Guideline. {See D.I. 115 at 25-27)\nPer the PSR, Ms. Sponaugle contends she made personal expenditures on her AAW credit card\nof $99,345.44, which should be offset by her unpaid bonuses, which in her view exceeded that\namount, resulting in a zero loss. {See D.I. 115 at 29)\n50A great deal of evidence concerning the loss amount was presented at trial and, even\nmoreso, during the evidentiary portions of the sentencing hearings. For the reasons explained\nbelow, the Court has concluded that the amount of loss proven by the government by the\nrequisite preponderance of the evidence is between $40,000 and $95,000.\n1. Applicable Legal Principles\nThe government \"bears the initial burden of proving loss by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\" United States v. Lacerda, 958 F.3d 196,214 (3d Cir. 2020). Based on the record, the\nCourt must calculate the loss amount \"associated with the crime of conviction and any relevant\nconduct that was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.\" Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \"While this does not have to be an exact figure, it must be a\nreasonable estimate.\" Id', see also All, 508 F.3d at 145; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n.3(C).\n2. The Court Did Not Find Accountant Hoffman's Analysis Persuasive\nThe government's position on the amount of loss it believes it proved is based largely on\nFBI Forensic Accoimtant Michelle Hoffman's analysis.^^ The Court did not find Ms. Hoffinan's\nanalysis persuasive, for reasons that are detailed below.\na. Hoffman's analysis was inconsistent, resulting in lower\nloss amounts each time she obtained more information\nIn the Indictment, the government charged Ms. Sponaugle with wire fraud leading to a\nloss of at least $322,652. (D.I. 2 at 2) At trial, the government alleged during its opening and\nclosing statements that the loss amount was \"well over a quarter of a million dollars.\" (Trial Tr.\nThe government also made the legal argument that the full amount of loss it is advocating for\nsentencing purposes is necessarily implied in the jury's guilty verdict. {See, e.g., D.I. 105 at 9-\n12) As already explained, the Court has rejected that contention. {See supra Part III)\n51at 309,1738) With further review after trial, the govermnent reduced its proposed total loss\namount to $241,893.98, of which $230,160.54 was from unauthorized credit card purchases and\nan additional $16,266 was from checks written from AAW's bank account. (See D.I. 115 at 6,\n29)^^ Accountant Hoffinan conceded that the amount of loss she found had dropped by nearly\n$100,000 over the course of the prosecution. (See Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 110; see also id. at 121\n(\"[OJbviously my number has gone down tremendously ....\")) She also admitted that as more\nevidence became available to her, the amount of loss she identified continually got smaller. (See\nid. at 106)\nWhile it is appropriate for the government to refine its analysis over time, and it is to\nAccountant Hoffinan's credit that she reduced her loss amounts as additional evidence persuaded\nher to do so, the constantly shrinking nature of her loss amount ultimately undermined the\nCourt's confidence in the loss amount the government is currently advocating. The government\nhas effectively conceded that it failed to prove what Ms. Hoffman expressly testified to before\nthe jury, and what the AUSAs expressly and repeatedly argued to the jury - that the loss from\nDefendant's fraud was \"well over a quarter of a million dollars.\" (Hof&nan Trial Tr. at 1082,\nThe government removed from its post-trial loss calculations an additional $4,532.65 for\nrepayments Sponaugle had made to AAW. (See D.I. 115 at 6,29; see also GX3) Ms. Sponaugle\ntestified that she repaid AAW $2,000 for mattresses and televisions she put on her AAW credit\ncard because she did not want those expenditures (for the home she was setting up after\nseparating from her ex-husband) to appear on her personal credit card statement. (See Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1426-27; see also GX3) She repaid AAW for this large expense because, she said,\nshe \"didn't want to take that big lump-sum off of my big line item, off my line amount,\" which\nthe Court understands to mean she did not want to use that much of her bonus at that point in the\nyear and for that expense. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 261) She also repaid the practice for an\nOlive Garden dinner with her ex-husband's aunt, feeling it was iuappropriate to charge this to\nAAW. (See Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1543-44) She elaborated that she had put this charge on her\nbusiness card because she did not have her personal card with her that day and she had\nreimbursed AAW for it because she did not want to use her bonus money towards this expense.\n(Id. at 1544, see also Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 262)\n521096-97,1171; Trial Tr. at 309-10,316,319 (opening); Trial Tr. at 1682 (closing)) Based on all\nthat has occurred in this case, it is the Court's expectation that, if more time were devoted to the\nloss analysis going forward, and if more evidence could be developed, the loss amount Ms.\nHof&nan would opine to would continue to drop; in other words, the pattern that has been\nobserved to this point in the process would continue.\nAll of this has led the Coint to conclude that while Ms. Hoffinan's most recent analysis\ncan reasonably be taken as a starting point, her (i.e., the government's) alleged loss amount is, as\ndiscussed below, substantially too high and, considering the totality of the record, unproven.\nb. Hoffman's analysis was not conservative, as it should\nhave been\nAccountant Hof&nan told the jury, and the Court, that her analysis of the extent of Ms.\nSponaugle's fraud was \"conservative.\" (Hoffman Trial Tr. at 1082; Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 286)\nShe explained that conservative meant giving the Defendant the benefit of the doubt \"whenever\nthere's a benefit of the doubt to be given.\" (Hoffman Sent. Tr. B at 106,108) She added that\n\"it's always important to be conservative\" because \"we want to be fair; fair to the victims in\ndetermining an actual loss amount and just fair in general of not overestimating something or\ngoing above and beyond.\" {Id. at 107)\nThe Court agrees with Accountant Hoffinan that a conservative analysis is appropriate\nhere, for the reasons she gave. Unfortunately, however. Accountant Hoffinan's analysis is not\nconservative. Rather, it is aggressive, in at least the following respects, all of which are further\ndescribed in ensuing sections:\n53(i) if the doctors said from the start of the investigation that a charge was not\nauthorized, and they persisted in that view, then Accountant Hoffinan\nalmost always treated the charge as not authorized;'^\u00ae\n(ii) if the only evidence about a charge (after all these years, and with thousands\nof transactions to evaluate) was the word of the doctors and the conflicting\ntestimony of the Defendant, the charge was almost always treated by\nAccountant Hoffinan as unauthorized;''^\n(iii) if there was no written communication (in the form of a text, electronic\nmedical record (\"EMR\"), or email), and no doctor had a specific\nrecollection of authorizing a particular charge, it was not authorized;''^\nSee, e.g., Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 128 (\"And when it was marked unauthorized by the doctors, I\nsided with the doctor saying this is not authorized.\"); id. at 129 (\"THE COURT: You've sided\nwith the doctors on that? THE WITNESS: Yes. THE COURT: Why?

And if we couldn't find evidence to support that it was\nauthorized, then it would remain an unauthorized expense.\").\nSee, e.g., Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 119-20 (\"THE COURT: This is where I'm getting lost, I\nthink, is how could the nature of the purchase tell you anything about whether it was something\nthat the doctor specifically authorized or not? I understand how it could tell you whether it's\noffice related versus personal, but part of the defense here is even personal stuff up to some\namount was authorized, so how does ['it is] obviously personal in nature['] tell you it cannot\npossibly be authorized? THE WITNESS: I guess I disagree. I did not have that same impression\nthat personal items up to a certain amoimt were authorized.\").\n''\" See, e.g., Hof&nan Sent. Tr. C at 372 (\"Q. ... And then you indicated that - for some of the\nthings such as ... the home decor and fumishings, things of that nature, that a lot of [weight]\nwas put into where it was shipped, either it was, I guess, fi:om Amazon and depending on where\nit was shipped, whether it was shipped to the practice office or it was shipped to Ms. Sponaugle's\nhome in Maryland; is that correct? A. The Amazon, that's correct. Q. Oh, for the Amazon one.\nSo is it fair to say, then, if it was shipped to Ms. Sponaugle's home, it was classified as being a\npersonal expenditure as opposed to an authorized business expenditure? A. We would look at\nthe type of item that it was and if we could clearly see that - but I wouldn't say it was - but,\nyeah, I guess that would be accurate. I would say the majority of things shipped to her home are\nin the unauthorized category.\").\n55further explained below/^\nc. Hoffman relied too heavily on the doctors' views, and\ngave extra weight to their initial conclusions\nIn determining which purchases were authorized or not, Accountant Hof&nan consulted\nthe doctors at AAW for their recollection and \\mderstanding of what was permitted. She largely\nrelied on the doctors' views. (See, e.g., Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 371 (Hoffinan agreeing she \"had\nto trust them,\" adding that what doctors told her \"made sense\"); Hoffman Sent. Tr. B at 109\n(Hoffinan agreeing she relied on \"what the victims are saying to us\")) She also placed weight on\nwhether the doctors told her from the very beginning of the investigation that the charge was\nunauthorized. (See Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 128)\nUnder the circumstances, Hoffinan relied too heavily on the doctors' views - and her\ndecision to do so renders her analysis aggressive, not conservative, with respect to the loss\ncalculation. Time and again, the doctors' recollection (or, more often, lack of recollection)\nturned out to be contradicted by Sponaugle's more clear recollection. (See generally McCracken\nSent. Tr. A at 241-42) (\"THE COURT: Is it possible, in your opinion, that you and your partners\ndon't remember every time that you would have authorized a purchase on the credit card by Ms.\nSponaugle? THE WITNESS: Yes, I'm sure our memory is not 100 percent. Collectively, I\nthink, we do very well.\") On these disputes, there was almost never any documentary evidence\nto support the doctors' position, while there was on many occasions some \"doctunentary\" (to\ninclude electronic mail, text messages, and EMRs) corroboration for Ms. Sponaugle's position.\nIn the Court's view, a truly conservative analysis would have given the Defendant the benefit of\nBy contrast, Sponaugle, both at trial and at sentencing, presented a \"conservative\" analysis of\nthe amoxmt of loss caused by her alleged fraud. (See infra Part rV.D.4)\n56the doubt on most or all of these disputes.''^\nThe Court's reasons for these conclusions do not include any finding that the doctors\nhave ever been intentionally untruthful, at any point during the investigation, prosecution, trial,\nor sentencing proceedings. Instead, the Court believes that due to the massive number of\ntransactions, the lengthy amount of time the fraudiilent scheme existed, and the time that passed\nbetween the events at issue and the testimony of the doctors, their recollections turned out to be\nmistaken on a not insubstantial number of occasions. More importantly, under the\ncircumstances, Hoffinan's (and the government's) heavy reliance on the doctors' recollections,\nparticularly on transactions Ms. Sponaugle expressly contested, often with documentary\nsupport, contributes to the Court's findings that Ms. Hoffinan's analysis was not conservative\nand, consequently, that the government failed to meet its burden of proof by a preponderance of\nthe evidence with respect to much of the alleged loss amount.\nA related issue is the great weight Accountant Hoffinan placed on how the partners treated\nthemselves. That is, when she saw Sponaugle doing something (i.e., charging something to the\npractice) that the partners did not do, she was pretty sure that meant what Sponaugle did was not\nauthorized. (See, e.g., Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 148) (observing, in course of opining that AAW\nchecks used to pay Sponaugle's taxes were imauthorized, \"doctors' taxes were not paid out of the\ncompany\") A major part of Sponaugle's defense was that she was treated like a partner, a\ncontention the partners and the government vigorously challenged. The Court is persuaded that\nthere is some significance to whether something Sponaugle spent AAW money on is something\nthe partners also spent AAW money on; where the Defendant was doing the same thing as the\npartners it seems more likely that she was authorized to do so. But this is merely one factor and\nit is far from dispositive. There is no reason that one or more of the partners could not have,\nregularly or occasionally, authorized Sponaugle to do something that the partners themselves did\nnot do. (See generally Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 149) (acknowledging partners could decide\ncompany would pay taxes for some individiials and not for others) Moreover, Ms. Sponaugle\nwas truly in a \"category of one\" at AAW: not a partner, but also not an ordinary employee, as\nshe managed the finances of the practice and she, alone, was a business partner of the doctors\n(and therefore a partial owner of one of the locations in which AAW operated).\n57The extra emphasis on transactions the doctors found from the start were imauthorized is\nalso unwarranted. The doctors' initial investigation was just that; a first effort to assess whether\nMs. Sponaugle had defrauded the practice. It was not a systematic, thorough, professional\nanalysis of the amount of loss. For example, during her initial review of statements of purchases\nfrom BJ's, Dr. McCracken did not examine any emails or text messages if it was \"obvious\" to\nher that something was \"imauthorized.\" (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 234-37) Dr. McCracken\nalso did not examine the office EMRs, an internal messaging system {see id. at 237), for any\ntransactions she evaluated, even though these messages could have provided evidence that a\nparticular charge was authorized. The methodology Dr. McCracken employed was entirely\nappropriate, given the limited purposes for which she was undertaking this effort.\"^^ After years\nof litigation, however, and with the now extensive record of AAW's culture - including the\ndoctors' generosity - and the trust placed in Ms. Sponaugle, it is now clear that, with significant\nfrequency, charges that at first seem \"obviously\" personal - such as cigars, trips, and purchases\nmade in Maryland - were actually likely authorized; or, at nimimum, the government has failed,\noften, to prove that these transactions were not authorized, {^ee infra \u00a7 lV.D.2.e)''^\nThe Court is not suggesting that the doctors had an obligation to be more thorough in their\nanalysis at any time. It was not their job, as victims of criminal activity, to conduct an\ninvestigation. Under the circumstances - as busy doctors who were in the process of losing and\nthen terminating their CEO, after discovering they had been victimized by her - the amount of\nwork the doctors did in cormection with the investigation is quite extensive, and admirable. The\nCourt's findings are based on the government's failings, not those of the doctors.\nMs. Hoffinan further opined that there was no room for Ms. Sponaugle to be confused as to\nwhich purchases she was permitted to make and which she was not. (See Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at\n71) The Court disagrees. Given especially AAW's culture of generosity and its lack of written\npolicies governing use of the company credit card, there was plenty of room for confusion - or\nwhat the parties have also referred to as \"gray areas.\"\n58d. Hoffman largely assumed that if a personal transaction\nwas not expressly authorized in writing or hy a doctor's\nspecific recollection, it was unauthorized\nHoffinan further assumed that if she could not identify a specific, written authorization\nfor a personal transaction, then the transaction was not authorized, unless the doctors specifically\ntold her that the transaction was authorized. (See, e.g., Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 138-39; id. at 59\n(\"If [the doctors] have no recollection and they say it was not authorized, that was our\ndetermination.\")) Based on the record before the Court, this is an unfounded assumption.\nNo one testified that Defendant, as AAW's CEO, had to consult all of the partners (or\neven one) with respect to every financial decision she made, or even every charge she put on her\ncompany credit card. Instead, she had wide discretion and the doctors' trust. (See D.I. 105 at\n19) (government arguing Sponaugle \"had the power to make decisions substantially fi:ee firom\nsupervision,\" as she \"was trusted and made financial decisions for AAW with little to no\nsupervision\") From this it follows that she did not need an express authorization for every\nfinancial transaction she undertook. Ms. Hoffinan's assumption to the contrary is not grounded\nin the record.\nMoreover, it is quite possible that many or most authorizations given to Ms. Sponaugle\nwere not in writing (email, text message, or EMR). Ms. Sponaugle testified, credibly, that\nauthorization for a personal charge was often given in casual discussion with one or more partner\nand other authorizations were implicit in the authority delegated to Ms. Sponaugle. (Sponaugle\nSent. Tr. B at 241) Ms. Sponaugle's testimony is well-supported by the record and is more\npersuasive than Hoffinan's aggressive assumption that the lack of a paper trail meant a particular\ntransaction was likely fraudulent.\n59e. Exemplary transactions demonstrating flaws in Hoffman's analysis\nThe reasons the Court has foimd Accountant Hof&nan's estimate of the loss amoimt\nunpersuasive are included throughout this Opinion. The Court now provides selected specific\nexamples which illustrate flaws in her analysis.\ni. Gas station expenses\nAccoimtant Hof&nan noticed many days on which Ms. Sponaugle had two different\ncharges at a gas station. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. B at 25) (\"[W]e identified numerous duplicate gas\npurchases on the same day.\") She explained that this issue first arose in \"the original approach\nthat Stefano Slack and Dr. McCracken and Dr. Chavez came up with,\" and those individuals\n\"felt gas expenses were authorized\" but \"there were instances where she was charging purchases\nat a gas station twice in the same day.\" {Id. at 124) For purposes of determining a loss amount,\nMs. Hoffinan treated the larger of the two same-day transactions as authorized - recognizing that\nMs. Sponaugle was permitted to charge gas on her company credit card - but always treated the\nsmaller of the two same-day transactions as imauthorized. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. A at 291;\nHof&nan Sent. Tr. B at 124-126) She did so despite having no receipts for these transactions and\nhaving no direct evidence as to what Ms. Sponaugle was purchasing at the gas stations.\n(Hof&nan Sent. Tr. A at 291; Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 125) Instead, Hof&nan treated these\namounts as imauthorized largely because they had always been treated as unauthorized firom the\ntime of AAW's earliest analyses. Hoffinan decided to be \"consistent\" with the doctors' own\napproach \"because it made sense. It was reasonable.\" (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 124)\nMoreover, Hof&nan could think of no good reason for having two gas station charges on\nthe same day, making it clear to her that at least one of the two same-day transactions had to\nhave been fraudulent. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. A at 125 (noting Defendant \"didn't live that far away\n60from All About Women [such] that she would be needing to fill up multiple times a day\");\nHoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 402) Ms. Hof&nan speculated that on what might be called \"double gas\ndays,\" one transaction might be for gas and the second might be for a purchase of food at a\nconvenience store associated with a gas station. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. B at 25) (\"[TJhere was a\npattern of maybe a larger purchase at a gas station and then a smaller [transaction]. .. maybe a\n$30 purchase, which one would assume was for gas and then a $10 purchase on the same day,\nwhich... one might assume was walking into a convenience store and grabbing coffee or a\nbreakfast sandwich or something.\") Based on this reasoning, Ms. Sponaugle was tagged with\n$1,926 of loss for purposes of sentencing. (See id. at 24-25)\nWhen Ms. Sponaugle was asked about the \"double gas\" purchase transactions, she had\nnot just one but two explanations, both of which strike the Court as entirely plausible and\ncredible. First, Ms. Sponaugle recalled that there were occasions when her tank would be low on\ngas and she would be rushing to work in the morning, so she would stop and put a few gallons of\ngas in the tank - to ensure she would get to work on time - and then on the way home, when not\nfaced with a similar time constraint, she would stop again and fill the tank. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr.\nB at 214) Second, Ms. Sponaugle recalled putting gas in her car before dropping it off for\nservice, then driving a loaner car during the day and later filling up the loaner car so she could\nreturn it full. (M at 213-14)\nThe government presented no evidence to contradict Ms. Sponaugle's explanations. To\nthe contrary, Ms. Hoffinan admitted she did not know whether Ms. Sponaugle's testimony\nregarding loaner cars was accurate or not. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 403) She had not even talked\nto the doctors about this issue. (Id.)\nThe Court finds that the government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n61that the gas station purchases made on days when Ms. Sponaugle charged more than one gas\nstation visit to her AAW card were unauthorized.\n11. BJ's/TargetAValmart\nMs. Hoffinan made assumptions about days on which she found multiple transactions at\nBJ's, Target, and Walmart. It was Ms. Hof&nan's opinion that when Ms. Sponaugle went to one\nof these stores more than once in the same day, at least some of the charges she made in the store\nmust be unauthorized and fraudulent. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 390) If she saw an office-related\nitem purchased from one of these stores and on the same day saw non-office-related items\npurchased from the same store, she assumed that the non-office-related item could not have been\nauthorized. {Id.)\nRelatedly, it appears that sometimes Ms. Hoffinan fovmd both business-related and\npersonal items on the same BJ's, Target, or Walmart receipt, and when she did so she generally\nassumed the personal items were imauthorized. At the same time, however, she also conceded\nthat in some such instances Ms. Sponaugle had probably inadvertently placed the personal items\nin the wrong pile at the store and, therefore, likely did not have an intent to defraud with respect\nto these purchases. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 390-91) (\"Q; Not an intent to try to fraudulently\npurchase something that you weren't entitled to purchase? A; Probably not.\")\nIf Ms. Hoffinan were to have taken a truly (and appropriately) conservative approach, she\nwould have given Ms. Sponaugle the benefit of the doubt and not treated any of these purchases\nas unauthorized. The Court finds that the government did not prove by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the purchases from BJ's, Target, and Walmart were imauthorized.\niii. Breast cancer walk\nAAW was an active participant in the aimual Komen Breast Cancer Walk in Philadelphia.\n62(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1306-08; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 181-83) Ms. Sponaugle led the\npractice's efforts in connection with this event. She arranged to rent a bus in which to transport\npractitioners (and sometimes their daughters) as well as employees and patients of the practice.\nShe also purchased, served, and cleaned up large quantities of food and refreshments on the bus.\nShe ordered t-shirts for the participants. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 127) Ms. Sponaugle, and often\nher daughter, also registered for and participated in the walk. Ms. Sponaugle placed all of these\nexpenditures on her AAW credit card. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1308; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at\n182; Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 127-28)\nBecause the doctors with whom the FBI was working acknowledged that almost all of\nthese expenses were authorized. Accountant Hoffinan treated nearly all of them as authorized. In\nHoffinan's view, \"it makes sense for an OB/GYN office to support breast cancer awareness.\"\n(Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 127)''\u00ae\nBut she did not deem all of the expenses associated with the breast cancer event to be\nauthorized. Instead, she concluded that $91.80 out of approximately $1,000 of expenditures\nwere unauthorized. {Id. at 126-28) Specifically, she excluded registration charges which she\nconcluded were \"clearly a personal signup for four individuals\" and, particularly, were for (at\nleast) Sponaugle and her daughter. {Id. at 12,126-28) Ms. Hoffinan found that \"none of the\nother doctors or practitioners were charging their personal signups for this walk on the [credit]\ncard.\" {Id. at 12-13) Accordingly, Hoffinan concluded \"it wasn't the culture of the practice\" to\npay for the registrations. {Id. at 128)\nSponaugle testified, however, that she was authorized to have the practice pay for her\nMs. Hoffinan generally relied on her \"own experience\" as to \"what would be reasonable in an\noffice setting\" or a \"doctor's office setting.\" (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 108)\n63registration and her daughter's. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 183) She asserted that when she\nregistered an AAW provider and the provider's child, the practice would pay. {Id. (\"I would pay\nfor all the providers, we would pay for the provider if they went and their children.\"); see also id.\nat 179-80 (noting that signups for other years had been marked as authorized)) She added that\nshe had to discuss the registrations with, for example. Dr. McCullough because \"I had to get the\ninformation from her daughter to register her daughter and herself.\" (Id. at 184) Sponaugle also\nintroduced photographs of herself and Dr. McCullough (among others) at a breast cancer walk.\n(Def. Sent. Ex. 28-16,28-17)\nThus, the record reveals a dispute of fact as to whether Ms. Sponaugle was authorized to\ncharge the cost of her and her daughter registering to participate in a breast cancer walk in which\nMs. Sponaugle was organizing the practice's involvement. On this dispute, the government\npresented no evidence to contradict Ms. Sponaugle's testimony - other than the word of\nAccovmtant Hoffinan. Ms. Hoffinan made clear that \"when it [i.e., the registration expenses] was\nmarked unauthorized by the doctors, I sided with the doctors saying this is not authorized.\"\n(Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 128) Ms. Hoffinan completely rejected the possibility of innocent\nmisunderstandings (see id. at 122) (\"I don't believe there was a confusion. ... I don't believe\nthere was confusion on Ms. Sponaugle's part for what she was doing.\"), yet another reason her\nconclusions were neither conservative nor persuasive. The Court finds the government did not\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that the payment of the registration fees was\nunauthorized.\niv. Gifts from the practice purchased by Sponaugle\nMs. Hoffinan treated as imauthorized, and therefore as loss attributable to fraud, $587.42\ncharged on Ms. Sponaugle's AAW credit card for purchases of food while she was on trips, such\n64as candy, cookies, and popcorn. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. B at 21) For instance, when Ms. Sponaugle\nwent to Hershey Park, she would bring back chocolates for the office. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at\n194; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 272) It appears to be rmdisputed that the purchased items at issue\nended up in the office and were made available to all AAW employees to enjoy.\nMs. Sponaugle testified, credibly, that she put these purchases on her AAW credit card\nbecause she was authorized to buy snacks and gifts for the practice. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at\n1296; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 194) She considered these purchases to be a gift from the\npractice to all employees, and her acquisition of them on behalf of the practice was part of her\nduty to keep the office stocked with snacks. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 272-73)^\u00b0 In other words,\nthese were perks provided by AAW (at the expense of its doctor-partners) to its employees, and\nMs. Sponaugle was merely the mechanism of provision - she made the purchase and brought the\ngoodies to the office, chargiug the expense to AAW.\nTo Ms. Hoffinan, however, these purchases were imauthorized and should he treated as\nloss for sentencing purposes. In her view, instead of being work treats provided by AAW to its\nemployees, these were personal gifts fi-om Ms. Sponaugle to her coworkers. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr.\nB at 21,131-34) Ms. Hoffinan suggested that Ms. Sponaugle was taking credit for generously\nproviding these items and that employees perceived them as gifts from her personally and not the\npractice, all \"[bjecause they were purchases made ... while she was on a specific vacation.\"\n(Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 132) Ms. Hoffinan reached this conclusion based on what the doctors\ntold her and \"on the whole,... life experience, common sense ... [wjhen it's a personal gift\nSimilarly, Ms. Sponaugle identified instances in which she purchased gift cards on her AAW\ncredit card for use as gifts from AAW, such as for a wedding or different office events.\n(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1315,1408)\n65from yourself, I don't believe the practice should pay for it.\" {Id. at 133) Ms. Hoffinan also\nfound added significance in the fact that the doctors had said from the beginning of the\ninvestigation that these transactions were not authorized, stating: \"again, if the doctors say it is\nunauthorized from the get-go, that tells me that they didn't feel she should be buying this type of\nstuff on her company credit card.\" {Id. at 132)\nThis distinction - between a gift to staff from AAW, procured by its CEO and properly\npaid for by the practice, and an expression of Ms. Sponaugle's personal generosity toward her\ncoworkers, and therefore an expense for which she should personally bear the cost - is subtle, at\nbest. This was not a matter Ms. Sponaugle ever talked to the doctors about. (Sponaugle Sent.\nTr. C at 272-77) Nor did any doctor testify about it. Given everything in the record about the\nculture of AAW and Ms. Sponaugle's role in the practice, it was entirely reasonable for her to\nbelieve she could make these sorts of purchases at the expense of AAW. At a nainimum, a\nconservative, persuasive loss analysis would not treat these expenditures as imauthorized. The\ngovernment failed to meet its burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that these\npurchases should count as loss attributable to fraud,\nv. Cigars\nMs. Hoffman identified cigar purchases made on Ms. Sponaugle's AAW credit card as\nunauthorized, based on statements like Dr. McCracken's that \"we do not buy cigars for our\npatients or their husbands.\" (McCracken Trial Tr. at 494) Ms. Sponaugle, however, did not\npurchase cigars for patients or their husbands. Instead, she testified, credibly, that her then-\nhusband helped install a security clock at one of the AAW offices, and thereafter the doctors told\nher to buy him some cigars as \"a token of appreciation.\" (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1304) In\nanother instance, one of the doctors consulted Ms. Sponaugle's then-husband about cigars and\n66decided an extra one should be purchased for the then-husband to thank him. (Id. at 1305)\nWhen asked about these occurrences, the doctors did not remember them, but they also had no\ndocumentary or other evidence to contradict Ms. Sponaugle's recollection. (McCullough Trial\nTr. at 683,852)\nMs. Sponaugle's testimony and recollection on these points were more credible than\nthose of the doctors.^' Ms. Hoffinan offered no persuasive reason for accepting the word of the\ndoctors over the word of Ms. Sponaugle on the issue of cigars, stating \"in this specific example,\na straight-up dispute, it was marked imauthorized from the very beginning, so I just left it as\nunauthorized.\" (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 129) When asked whether that was conservative, even\nDr. Hoffinan admitted \"[i]n this instance, I don't - probably not.\" (Jd.)\nA truly conservative analysis would give Ms. Sponaugle the benefit of the doubt on\ndisputes like these. Ms. Hoffinan's contrary approach is not conservative, and not persuasive.\nThe Court finds that the government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\ncigar purchases were fraudulent.\nvi. Parking\nMs. Hoffinan initially identified parking charges in Wilmington as unauthorized.\n(Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1153) At trial, Ms. Hoffinan told the jury that these charges would have\nbeen treated as authorized if they were incurred iu connection with Ms. Sponaugle traveling to a\nWilmington courthouse to assist with a medical malpractice trial, but Ms. Hoffinan counted\nThis should not be surprising. The long ago purchases were of far more consequence in Ms.\nSponaugle's life than in the lives of the busy doctors, whose involvement in the transactions\ntypically consisted of (at most) a fleeting moment of conversation or a message or email. Ms.\nSponaugle, by contrast, not only had the interaction with the doctor but then also made the\npurchase, entered it into QuickBooks, and distributed the items purchased (here, the cigars to her\nhusband). In the Court's view, she is far more likely than the doctors to remember the practice\nbuying her husband (now ex-husband) a thank-you cigar.\n67some parking charges as fraudiilent because the doctors marked them as vmauthorized. {Id. at\n1153-54) Then Ms. Sponaugle testified at trial that the charges identified by Hoffman were, in\nfact, incurred in connection with a trial. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1389-91) Thereafter, at the\nsentencing proceedings, Ms. Hof&nan modified her analysis and began to treat certain Colonial\nParking expenses as authorized - but still she considered other miscellaneous parking expenses\n(at different times and places) to be not authorized. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 346-47) Ms.\nSponaugle then testified again and explained that these other Wilmington parking charges would\nalso have been related to work, incurred either in connection with meeting with AAW's lawyers\nor other work events. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 210) When, still later in the proceedings, Ms.\nHoffman was asked about these remaining \"unauthorized\" parking charges, she stated that she\nhad taken the doctors at their word on this point, without any further investigation; she\napparently did not think any additional analysis was necessary, given that only \"a very small\namount\" of money was involved. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. C at 377-78)\nAgain, the Court found Ms. Sponaugle's explanation of the parking charges to be\ncredible. Other than the doctors' say-so, the government offered no evidence to counter her\ntestimony. Given the state of the record, a conservative analysis would not have treated these\nparking charges as unauthorized. The government has failed to prove by a preponderance of the\nevidence that these charges should be included in the loss amount.\nvii. Home security system\nMs. Sponaugle testified that when, after separating from her then-husband, she moved\ninto a new home, the doctors discussed paying for installing a security system at that home, and\neventually decided to gift the security system to her. (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 98,222-24; see\nalso Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1286) Ms. Sponaugle recalled talking to Dr. McCullough about the\n68office buying the security system. (Jd.) She also introduced into evidence a text message in\nwhich Dr. McCullough wrote to Dr. McCracken; \"2 thoughts. She wants security ... installed at\nnew house? No idea what they run, but could we pay for install?\" (Def. Sent. Ex. 34 at A-0293)\nDr. McCracken did not recall this discussion. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 622) Having nothing\nmore than Dr. McCracken's lack of recollection, Ms. Hoffinan decided the doctors must not have\napproved the purchase, and treated the security system charge as imauthorized. (Hoffinan Sent.\nTr. C at 373-74)\nThe Court found Ms. Sponaugle credible on this point. Her testimony was at least\npartially corroborated by the text message between the two doctors. By contrast, the government\ncould point to no documentary evidence on its side and its witness. Dr. McCracken, did not\n(imderstandably) recall approving this transaction all these years later. The Court finds that the\ngovernment did not meet its burden and, hence, the Court will not include these amoimts in its\nloss calculation.\nviii. Non-Delaware purchases or deliveries\nAccountant Hoffinan further assumed that \"the majority of things shipped to\n[Sponaugle's] home\" was unauthorized. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. C at 372) She treated nearly all\npurchases and deliveries not made to the office as loss attributable to fraud. (Hoffinan Trial Tr.\nat 1137) Hoffinan had to admit, however, that in reviewing, for example, Amazon purchases\nshipped to Ms. Sponaugle's Maryland home, Hoffinan often did not have any additional\nAgain, this should not be surprising. The purchase of a security system for her own home, at a\ndifficult time in her personal life, was undoubtedly far more important - and memorable - to Ms.\nSponaugle than it was to the doctors, who were being characteristically generous to and\nsupportive of their CEO but could have easily forgotten this particular purchase.\n69docvimentation (beyond the charges themselves) to enable her to verify whether a purchase was\nauthorized.

C at 372)\nMs. Sponaugle testified, credibly, that she would buy things in bulk for the practice,\nincluding when they were on sale or she was in a BJ's, and she would make these purchases at\nall different times, including during weekends at home in Maryland. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at\n1310-11) Similarly, Ms. Sponaugle testified that \"lots of things were shipped to my home for\nwork.\" (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 191) The government presented no persuasive evidence to the\ncontrary, only Ms. Hoffinan's rmsupported speculation.\nThe Court finds that the government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the purchases made outside of Delaware, or purchases shipped to Ms. Sponaugle's Maryland\nhome, were fraudulent.\nis.. Additional unproven categories\nThe Court could go on. There are nmnerous other categories Ms. Hof&nan deemed to be\nunauthorized expenses that the Court does not believe the government proved, by a\npreponderance of evidence, were unauthorized (or imauthorized to the extent the government\ncontends).^^ This already-lengthy Opinion would stretch far longer were the Court to describe.\nCompare, e.g., \"Travel - Hotel after Xmas Party (not approved by owners)\" (D.I. 116 Ex. 1 at\n2) with McCullough Trial Tr. at 821-22 (testifying Defendant stayed overnight after cleaning up\nafter party and McCullough woxxld have authorized paying for hotel stay if she had been asked);\n\"TraveWacation - CES Wedding NY\" (D.I. 116 Ex. 1 at 2) with Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1409-11\n(Defendant explaining she attended wedding as representative of AAW as a \"business duty,\"\nsince the doctors \"pretty much told me, why don't you, you know, go on behalf of us, if you can\ngo\"); \"TraveWacation - Phoenix trip extra-curricular with companion on trip\" (D.I. 116 Ex. 1 at\n2) with Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1591-92 (\"Every time you go on a conference, normally they\nallow one kind of offsite show or excursion or something like that, yes....

Rather than doing so, the Court will take an\nadditional 25% deduction off of Ms. Hoffinan's maximmn loss amount, as explained later in this\nOpinion. (See infra Part IV.D.7.d)\n3. The Government's Showing Is Further Weakened By Its\nHeavy Reliance On Hearsay\nThe government's effort to prove its proposed loss amount was further undermined by its\nheavy reliance on hearsay. The government chose to call only one first-hand fact witness. Dr.\nMcCracken, as part of the sentencing proceedings.^'' Instead of calling multiple doctors to\ntestify, the government elected to have Dr. McCracken testify that she spoke to the other doctors\n- including on many of the points Ms. Sponaugle had raised at trial and in connection with\nsentencing - and to have Dr. McCracken tell the Court what the other doctors could and could\nnot recall.^^\nIt is permissible to rely on hearsay in a sentencing proceeding. See, e.g.. Fed. R. Evid.\n1101(d)(3) (providing that Rules of Evidence do not apply at sentencing). Nevertheless, as the\nCourt warned the government (see Feb. 11 Tr. at 9), hearsay is generally less probative and\npersuasive than direct evidence. See Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284,298 (1973) (\"Out-\nof-court statements ... lack the conventional indicia of reliability; they are usually not made\nSayers' deposit on AAW credit card, then received check for that amount from Sayers - which is\nExhibit 39 - and then deposited it along with other checks into AAW bank account).\nWhile several other AAW doctors testified at trial, that was before Ms. Sponaugle's defense\nwas in the record, so these witnesses often did not provide evidence directly responsive to the\nfact disputes raised by the Defendant's testimony. While multiple AAW doctors provided victim\nimpact statements, these statements were not sworn testimony on which the Court can rely in\nresolving fact disputes.\nThe government's decision not to call more witnesses is the subject of the U.S. Attorney\nOffice's letter of March 31, which was discussed in detail above. (See supra Part II.E)\n71under oath;... not subject to cross-examination; and [the declarant] is not available in order that\nhis demeanor and credibility may be assessed. .. .\")\u2022 Among other deficiencies, it is impossible\nto assess the credibility of the out-of-court declarant when her statement is admitted through\nhearsay.\nAn illustrative example of the weakness of hearsay testimony was Dr. McCracken's\ntestimony that none of the partners thought Ms. Sponaugle was going to get a large deferred\nbonus, an issue she spoke to the other partners about in preparation for her sentencing testimony.\n(McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 233-34) Yet the record is plainly shows that at least Dr. McCullough\ndisbelieve that Sponaugle would get a big deferred bonus. (See, e.g., McCullough Trial Tr. at\n664-65, 721-24) When shown a message Dr. McCiillough had sent Defendant in 2016, in which\nDr. McCullough clearly expressed the view that Sponaugle's bonuses were deferred (and not\nwaived forever). Dr. McCracken responded: \"I personally do not agree with the wording of the\ne-mail, but I can't comment on what she [Dr. McCullough] was thinking at that time.\"\n(McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 262; see also id. at 265 (\"[T]hat is not my imderstanding and in\nspeaking with Dr. McCullough and the partners that was not any of our understanding.\")) It may\nbe that Dr. McCullough did not share her true views with Dr. McCracken, or that Dr. McCracken\nis somehow mistaken about what Dr. McCullough told her. The point is, however, that in\nconnection with sentencing, there was no one other than Dr. McCracken to ask about this topic.\nThe government's evidence would likely be far more probative if it did not consist of so much\nhearsay.\n4. Ms. Sponaugle Did Offer A Conservative Analysis Of Loss\nMaking Ms. Hoffinan's failure to conduct a conservative analysis all the more striking is\nthat the Defendant, Ms. Sponaugle, did offer a conservative analysis of loss. That is, Ms.\n72Sponaugle provided a loss analysis that gave the benefit of the doubt to the government, she\nresolved doubts against her own interests. To be clear, while Ms. Sponaugle denied any\nwrongdoing, and contends that AAW owes her money,^^ she also, in the alternative, thoroughly\nanalyzed Ms. Hof&nan's loss analysis. In doing so, Sponaugle frequently agreed that for\npurposes calculating the applicable loss she could accept treating a transaction as unauthorized if\nshe could not be sure that it was authorized. (See, e.g., Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 284-86)\nFor example, the government pointed to a purchase at a Coach store on April 25,2014.\n{See Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1533) Ms. Sponaugle could not recall if it was for a gift for a staff\nmember, which would have been authorized, or a personal purchase, which would have been\nunauthorized; thus, in her annotation of the government's spreadsheet, Sponaugle did not\n\"classify it as a business expense, even though it likely was.\" (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1533-35,\n1609) Sponaugle also identified a $177 purchase at CoCo Cove on May 29,2014 that she\nthought was an authorized trip that the doctors had told her to take, but she kept it as an\nimauthorized purchase in her analysis because she could not be sure. {Id. at 1533-34) Ms.\nSponaugle testified that an August 18,2014 purchase at Dick's Sporting Goods was likely\nauthorized because she had made several purchases at Dick's for work events (e.g., outdoor\ngames for when she hosted a party for AAW's employees), but since she could not remember\nwhat she bought on this exact date she was would treat the purchase as unauthorized. {Id.)\nSimilarly, Ms. Sponaugle testified that purchases at JCPenney ($132 on August 18,2014) and\nIn a sentencing memorandum, the defense argues that $169,372 of the Defendant's credit card\npurchases between 2012 and 2018 were authorized. {See D.I. 106 Ex. A) The defense then\nsubtracted that from the FBI's total loss amount ($239,075 at the time), resulting in a total of\n$69,702 in unauthorized purchases. {Id.) Defendant then identified $105,000 worth of bonuses\nnot taken during her tenure at AAW to argue that AAW owes her $35,297. {Id.)\n73Kohl's ($179 on October 28,2014) could have been gifts for staff or practitioners but, being\nunsure, she treated them \"conservatively not as approved.\" {Id. at 1534-35)\n5. Ms. Sponaugle Reasonably Believed She Was Permitted To\nUse Her AAW Credit Card For Personal Purchases Of Up To\n$20,000 Annually - A Total Of $70,000 - After She Stopped\nTaking Bonuses\nThe Court finds that Ms. Sponaugle reasonably believed she was authorized to spend up\nto approximately $20,000 per year, during the pendency of her divorce proceedings, from\nOctober 2014 to March 2018, when she was not taking cash bonuses.^^ The government failed to\nprove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the contrary.\nMs. Sponaugle's testimony on this point was clear and credible. {See, e.g., Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1283-84,1604-05; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 245-51 (stating that bonuses in this\nperiod \"were taken as the credit card use,\" as doctors \"told me to take it as I need it\")) By\ncontrast, the doctors' testimony on the topic of Ms. Sponaugle's bonuses was inconsistent. Dr.\nMcCracken testified that Ms. Sponaugle had opted to forgo her bonus payments entirely,\nbelieving that Ms. Sponaugle volimtarily took a pay cut of approximately $20,000 annually, in\nexchange for more flexible work hours and work-at-home arrangements. (McCracken Trial Tr.\nat 527) No documentary evidence was presented to support Dr. McCracken's understanding.\nDr. McCullough, however, testified that Ms. Sponaugle had only deferred receiving her bonuses\nuntil after the divorce proceedings were completed. (McCullough Trial Tr. at 664-65,721-24)\nDr. McCullough's recollection was supported, in part, by email messages she wrote Ms.\nBecause the jury was not required to make any finding as to an amoimt of loss, the guilty\nverdict does not necessarily imply that the jiiry rejected Ms. Sponaugle's testimony about being\npermitted to take her bonus amounts in the form of charging personal expenditures on her AAW\ncredit card.\n74Sponaugle in June 2016, asking when she would \"finally take all the bonuses you have deferred\"\nand noting she would be receiving \"a whopper of a back bonus.\" (GX72; see also GX73\n(McCullough asking Sponaugle \"when can you finally take your bonuses that you have deferred\nfor all these years. Time for you to ... sit on a beach, order a margarita.\"))\nIt is undisputed that conversations occmred between the Defendant and the doctors about\nwhat to do with Sponaugle's bonuses in light of the advice she claimed to have received firom a\nfamily law attomey. (See, e.g., McCracken Trial Tr. at 434-35 (\"So Kim came to us when she\nwas going through a separation and divorce and said she was advised by her divorce lawyer that\nshe really couldn't show any additional income because then it meant she would owe him child\nsupport instead of being even or him owing her.\"); id. at 511) There is also no dispute that the\ndoctors agreed to help the Defendant. (See, e.g., D.I. 73 at 7-8) (government pretrial\nmemorandum stating that \"[t]he partners, wanting to find other ways to support the defendant,\nauthorized specific, one-time personal purchases on the defendant's credit card\") (emphasis\nadded) The disputes are only in the details of what was agreed to and, in particular, the extent of\nthe personal charges Ms. Sponaugle was authorized to put on her AAW credit card in the 2014 to\n2018 period. For the reasons provided in this section and throughout the Opinion, the Court\nfinds that the parties agreed that Ms. Sponaugle could charge up to $20,000 annually on her\nAAW credit card, with the resulting bills to be paid at the expense of AAW.\nWhen Ms. Sponaugle's marriage was falling apart, a family law attomey she consulted\nencouraged her to stop taking cash bonuses lest she be required to make child support payments\nto her soon-to-be ex-husband (who she expected would squander the money on himself and not\nuse it for their children). She shared the details of this challenging situation with her employers\n- who were also her close fiiends - and, she credibly testified, they responded m their\n75characteristically generous and supportive manner, by agreeing she could take her bonuses in an\nalternate form. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1604 (\"I had specifically had a conversation with [the\ndoctors] after meeting with my attorney ... to ask if they were okay with that; and... to come\nup with an alternative plan.\"); Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 247 (\"And when I went back to the\noffice, I told [the doctors] that [my attorney]. .. recommended that I stop taking the bonuses and\nto take them alternatively. And [the doctors] told me absolutely, you know, take it as you need\nit.\")) The agreement, she continued, was that she could take her bonuses (which had formerly\nbeen provided in cash) in the form of putting personal charges on her AAW credit card. (See\ngenerally McCullough Trial Tr. at 641-42 (\"There would be times when I specifically would be\nthe one to reach out to her and say, in lieu of a bonus, if you can't take cash, would you prefer to\ndo something else; for example, a trip.\"); see also D.I. 118 (summarizing Dr. McCullough\ntestimony and messages relating to bonuses)) From that point on, it was reasonable for Ms.\nSponaugle to understand that she was authorized to make approximately $20,000 of personal\npurchases on her AAW credit card annually. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1283-84,1604-05)^\u00ae\nConsistent with this understanding, when, in March 2018, without warning, Ms. Sponaugle was\nA $20,000 annual bonus was the number used most consistently at trial. In his closing\nargument to the jury, defense counsel made a brief allusion to adding summer and Christmas\nbonuses, which would bring the amount Ms. Sponaugle was due (and, therefore, could have\nreasonably believed she could have put on the AAW credit cards) closer to $30,000 a year, for a\ntotal of \"$90 to $100,000.\" (Trial Tr. at 1742) Defense counsel's initial sentencing\nmemorandum argues that Sponaugle was entitled to $105,000 in bonuses (see D.l. 106 Ex. A),\nand Ms. Sponaugle testified in support of this same amount at the sentencing hearing (see\nSponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 46-48). For the reasons stated in this section, however, the Court finds\nthat the best estimate of the total bonuses which Ms. Sponaugle reasonably believed she could\nhave charged to her AAW credit card is approximately $70,000 altogether.\n76told she was being terminated, she asked about the \"$60,000, at least,\" that she was owed.\n(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1515; see also Termination Video at 4:38)^^\nMs. Sponaugle had received bonuses of $33,000, $10,000, $20,000, and $20,000 in 2011,\n2012,2013, and 2014, respectively. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 520) Thus, her average annual\nbonus in the period leading up to October 2014 was approximately $20,000. (Id. at 521) For the\n3 Vi year period from October 2014 through March 2018, that is equivalent to an anticipated\nbonus of $70,000.\nThe government and its witnesses agree that from at least 2011 through 2014, Ms.\nSponaugle's bonus structure was that she would be provided a quarterly $5,000 bonus (for a total\nof $20,000 per year), as long as AAW had a net income that quarter. (McCracken Trial Tr. at\n520; McCullough Trial Tr. at 714; Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1090-91; see also Sponaugle Trial Tr. at\n1267-68) Ms. Hoffinan determined that from 2015 to 2017, AAW had only five quarters in\nwhich it earned a profit, making Ms. Sponaugle's potential bonus over that period only, at most,\n$25,000. (Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1096) However, Dr. McCracken testified that for many quarters\nin which AAW earned no net income, the practice still gave Ms. Sponaugle her bonus - even in\nThe Termination Video of the March 2018 meeting at which AAW's lawyer confronted\nSponaugle with the allegation of fraud shows the attorney saying the following to her:\nThe purpose of this meeting is to inform you that your employment\nwith All About Women is being terminated effective\nimmediately. And the reason for the termination is that it has\ncome to our attention that you have used the company's credit card\nwithout authorization multiple times to run up tens of thousands of\ndollars of expenses for personal [indecipherable].\nAs the attomey speaks, Ms. Sponaugle repeatedly says \"okay.\" (Termination Video at\n2:45-3:09; see also Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 216) She explained in Court: \"I didn't even know\nwhat to say. I was completely flabbergasted. ... And I was just like okay. Like, you're asking\nme to not do this and not do that, okay, okay.\" (Sent. Tr. C at 289)\n77qiiarters in which the partners themselves did not take bonuses. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 440-41;\nsee also Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1095,1159; GX95 (showing Sponaugle bonuses in Q4 2012, Q4\n2013, and Q3 2014 despite AAW having negative net income in those quarters); Sponaugle Trial\nTr. at 1270; see generally Smith Trial Tr. at 873-74 (stating that she herself received her bonuses\nabout \"90 percent of the time\")) Thus, the Court finds that Ms. Sponaugle reasonably believed\nthat she was entitled to take the equivalent of $5,000 quarterly bonuses for the period October\n2014 through March 2018, which is essentially 3 V2 years, or 14 quarters, for a total of $70,000.^\"\nUnder these imusual circumstances, and given the culture of AAW and Ms. Sponaugle's\nrole in the practice and her relationship with its partners, the Court is persuaded that Ms.\nSponaugle reasonably believed she was authorized to make $20,000 worth of purchases based on\nher annual bonus structure. In the years prior to her divorce, Ms. Sponaugle's total gross\nearnings were close to $130,000 annually. (See Sponaugle Tr. at 1272-73) Ms. Sponaugle's\nperformance reviews were outstanding. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 522) There is no evidence that\nthe practice sought to reduce her income in or around 2014 through 2018. Instead, it was Ms.\nSponaugle who decided to stop taking cash bonuses, based on advice from her divorce attorney.\nDr. McCracken also testified that \"we often gave a summer and Christmas bonus ... to all of\nour work staff,\" including Ms. Sponaugle. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 519; see also Sponaugle\nTrial Tr. at 1265,1269-70,1613; Smith Trial Tr. at 871-74) Ms. Sponaugle testified that her\nChristmas and summer bonuses were each around $5,000 (Sponaugle Tr. at 1272), but Ms.\nHoffinan and Dr. McCracken testified that summer and Christmas bonuses were often closer to\n$1,000 or $2,000 (Hoffinan Trial Tr. at 1105; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 18). Dr. McCracken\ntestified that two of Ms. Sponaugle's four quarterly bonuses were considered her summer and\nChristmas bonuses. (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 177) Given the lack of clarity as to Ms.\nSponaugle's eligibility for and practice of receiving summer and Christmas bonuses, and\nwhether they were in addition to her four quarterly bonuses, and given that there was only one\nyear in which Ms. Sponaugle received an overall bonus of more than $20,000, the Court\nconcludes that the most appropriate, supported number to use for her bonuses is $20,000\nannually.\n78(See Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1283) That attorney, according to Ms. Sponaugle, told her to take the\nbonuses in some other way. (See id. at 1284) The Court believes the partners, imdoubtedly\nthinking they were helping Ms. Sponaugle in a difficult time - and likely thinking they were\nacting in the best interests of AAW, which at the time was to all appearances benefiting from\nMs. Sponaugle's continued efforts as its CEO - agreed to this arrangement.\nThe Court recognizes that its conclusion may seem at odds with common sense. For\nmost employers, it would be unimaginable for the partners to agree that a non-partner employee\ncould forego cash bonuses, so that they would not show up on her income statements - thereby\nstrengthening her case in an ongoing divorce proceeding \u2014 and instead take an equivalent amount\nof money by charging personal expenses to an employer-issued credit card. But at All About\nWomen, at the time Ms. Sponaugle was CEO, the culture was extraordinarily generous, there\nwere no written policies against such an agreement, and the partners seemed genuinely to care\nfor Ms. Sponaugle and to want to help her through a very challenging time in her personal life.\nTherefore, the Court will treat $70,000 of charges Ms. Sponaugle put on her AAW credit\ncard between October 2014 and March 2018 as bonuses and, therefore, authorized - and not as\nloss attributable to fraud for purposes of sentencing.^^ The government failed to prove its\ncontrary interpretation of the record by the required preponderance of the evidence.\nTo the Court's knowledge, no one associated with this case has been charged with a tax-\nrelated offense, and the forthcoming sentencing for wire fraud presents no occasion for the Court\nto determine whether anyone could or should be so charged. In the course of the sentencing\nproceedings, evidence emerged that appeared to show that Ms. Sponaugle did not report on her\nincome tax returns the $70,000 of bonuses taken in the form of authorized credit card charges.\n(Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 253 (\"The Court: I take it you did not pay taxes on that; is that right?\nMs. Sponaugle: No, I did not claim it because I didn't know I was supposed to claim it.\"); see\nalso D.I. 73 at 9) It is imclear whether she was acting on advice of counsel in this respect. That\nMs. Sponaugle's explanation of her conduct might potentially create tax liabilities and other\npotential legal ramifications, only heightens her credibility in the Court's view. The Court does\n796. The Government Failed To Prove That Any Check Payments\nWere Unauthorized\nAt trial, only a single government witness, Kathy Storm, testified about checks written by\nMs. Sponaugle on an AAW checking account that were allegedly personal in nature. (Storm\nTrial Tr. at 990-91) After trial, for the first time the government identified specific checks and\nspecific amounts that it now contends should be included in the loss amount for purposes of\nsentencing. (D.I. 105 at 17-18; see also Feb. 11 Tr. at 28 (AUSA: \"All that the jury heard about\nthose checks was ... an example of a check... But we didn't discuss it at length because it's\nrelevant conduct for sentencing.\"))\nThere is no dispute that these checks are relevant conduct. See SG \u00a7 IB 1.3 cmt. 5(B)(i)\n(defining \"common scheme or plan\" as acts \"substantially cormected to each other by at least one\ncommon factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar\nmodus operandry, see also United States v. Siddons, 660 F.3d 699, 704 (3d Cir. 2011) (stating\nthat loss amount \"encompasses all relevant conduct that was part of the same course of conduct\nor common scheme or plan\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The issue is whether the\ngovernment has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the checks Ms. Sponaugle wrote\nwere not authorized by the practice. The Court finds that the government has not met its burden.\nThe government alleges that Ms. Sponaugle wrote a total of $16,266 of unauthorized\nchecks from 2012 to 2018 to: the Comptroller of Maryland for her 2016 and 2017 taxes; the\nIntemal Revenue Service for her 2017 taxes; a fiiend, Erika Beard, for Hershey Park tickets;\nJulie Wolfe, for housekeeping services; and LNZ Consulting, for personal coaching. (D.I. 116\nnot believe Ms. Sponaugle would falsely make such statements considering the problematic\nconsequences that could follow.\n80Ex. 1) While the government proved that Ms. Sponaugle wrote these checks, and did so on an\nAAW business checking account (points that are not in dispute), it failed to prove that she was\nnot authorized to do so.\nAs with the credit card transactions, the government relies essentially entirely on the\ndoctors as to what they remember as being authorized,\u00ae^ without documentary corroboration of\nthe supposedly unauthorized character of the checks. It points, as well, to Ms. Hoffman's\nanalysis, which is not based on any deep investigation into the nature of these checks; instead,\nMs. Hof&nan relied on the doctors' statements and their own personal conduct without\ncontacting third parties. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. B at 66-67 (\"Q: Did anyone interview Julie Wolf?\nA: No.\"); id. at 70 (\"Q: We have a dispute as to whether it's authorized or unauthorized. .. and\nthe tiebreaker wasn't reach out to [the recipient of the check]?

[the other partners'] taxes were not being paid out of the practice.\"); id.\nat 148 (\"[T]ypically in a partnership like this, they would pay for all of the taxes of the\ndoctors.\")) For the same reasons already given, the Court is not persuaded by the doctors' lack\nof recollection with respect to the checks or by Ms. Hofftnan's analysis on this point.\nFor example, Ms. Sponaugle testified credibly that she used an AAW check on March 31,\n2016 to pay $395 for Hershey Park tickets, acquiring the tickets in order to have them available\nto provide as awards to AAW employees of the month, a task within the scope of her duties.\n(Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 190-92; see also GX204) The government presented no direct\nSee supra Part IV.D.2.c; see also Hof&nan Sent. Tr.

Dr. McCracken could not remember if\nHershey Park tickets were ever made available to the staff. (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 156-57)\nMs. Hoffinan could not remember if the FBI had ever asked the doctors whether they authorized\npurchasing Hershey Park tickets. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 62-63) In the Court's view, the\ngovernment failed to prove this was an unauthorized transaction. It is not included in the Court's\nloss calculation.\nThe government also failed to prove that the checks written to Julie Wolfe and LNZ\nConsulting were unauthorized. (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 43, 64-66; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 69-\n72,184-90; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 139-43,215-16 (\"I just know that we all used that\nhousekeeper personally at some point, and we paid for it out of our personal money. And that is\nnot something that the practice - that I or the partners ever recall discussing.\") Ms. Sponaugle\ntestified that Ms. Wolfe's cleaning services were a gift firom the practice to her (Sponaugle Sent.\nTr. B at 186), testimony that was corroborated by Mr. JCihnon, a private investigator, who\ninterviewed Ms. Wolfe (see Kilmon Sent. Tr.

Given the totality of the\nrecord, and all the conclusions the Court has drawn throughout this Opinion, the Court finds the\ngovernment did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the checks written by Ms.\nSponaugle to Julie Wolfe were rmauthorized.\nSimilarly, Ms. Sponaugle testified that Dr. McCullough had authorized her to obtain\nMr. Kilmon's testimony about Ms. Wolfe's statements was hearsay, and less probative than\nnon-hearsay.

Ex. 13 at 1; see also DX20 (Zlupko internal records show client as AAW);\nMcCracken Sent. Tr. A at 139) At sentencing. Dr. McCracken, on behalf of all the doctors,\ntestified that none of them authorized counseling, or agreed to pay for it; she characterized Dr.\nMcCullough's email as just \"a referral from Dr. McCullough to call Lani\" because Dr.\nMcCullough thought Zlupko's services \"would be helpful.\" {Id. at 140) Dr. McCullough was\nnot asked at trial about whether she intended to convey to Ms. Sponaugle merely that Dr. Zlupko\nwould be helpful or also that Ms. Sponaugle was so important to the practice, and under such\nstress due to her deteriorating marriage, that AAW would pay for Dr. Zlupko's services. Dr.\nMcCullough did not testify at the sentencing hearing. Ms. Hoffinan did not ask Dr. Zlupko what\nshe knew about whether the practice was supposed to pay for the services she provided to Ms.\nSponaugle; she also failed to identify any evidence to corroborate what the doctors told her.\n(Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 69-75) When weighing all of this evidence, in light of the entire record,\nthe Court finds that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nchecks Ms. Sponaugle wrote to Ms. Zlupko were imauthorized.\nMs. Sponaugle testified that, starting in 2016, she was required to pay quarterly tax\nreturns for iocome she received in connection with her partnership in ISIS Med.^ The tax return\n^ ISIS Med is a medical technology-based company named after an ancient goddess; it was,\ninitially, equally owned by Drs. McCullough, Goshow, Larkin, and McCracken, as well as Ms.\n83associated with this income was sent to Ms. Sponaugle by Ralph Cetrulo, who was both her\npersonal accountant and AAW's accountant, and the return appeared to her to be the business'\ntax retum. (McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 231; Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B at 196-98) Cetrulo had\nregularly prepared the practice's tax returns and sent them to Ms. Sponaugle, and she had\nregularly then paid the practice's taxes with an AAW check. {Id. at 196-98) She had never had\nto file or pay quarterly taxes for herself before but had always paid quarterly taxes for AAW, so\nwhen Cetrulo sent her the paperwork (including payment coupons) for qiiarterly taxes she \"just\nassumed that I had to pay these out of the business, so that's what I did.\" (Sponaugle Sent. Tr. B\nat 197) Because she had never before been a partner in a partnership, and had never seen tax\ndocuments quite like those Cetrulo was sending to her, she did not imderstand they were for\ntaxes she owed personally. {Id.) Under these circumstances - none of which were disproven by\nthe government\u00ae^ \u2014 the Court finds that Ms. Sponaugle had a good faith belief that the tax-related\nchecks she was writing were properly written on AAW's account because she reasonably\nthought she was paying AAW's taxes and not her own. At minimum, a truly conservative\nanalysis of loss would not include these checks (or any of the other checks in Ms. Hoffinan's\nanalysis) as firaudulent.\nThus, again, the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that any\nof the check payments were imauthorized. None will be included in the Court's calculation of\nSponaugle. (McCracken Trial Tr. at 419) ISIS Med also owned a portion of AAW's real estate\nventures, including All About Women Real Estate. {Id. at 420)\nMs. Hof&nan acknowledged that she did not consider the partnership income as being the\nbasis for the tax payments Ms. Sponaugle made using an AAW check; she assumed the check\npayments for taxes were imauthorized only because Ralph Cetrulo said so. (Hof&nan Sent. Tr. B\nat 147-48)\n84the loss amount.\n7. Calculation Of The Loss Amount\nHaving found Accoxmtant Hoffinan's loss calculation analysis aggressive, rather than\nconservative; flawed in other respects, as described above; and largely impersuasive, the Court\nmust now make a determination as to the amount of loss proven by the government. Based on a\nthorough consideration of the entire record, and for reasons described throughout this Opinion,\nthe Court finds that the government has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the loss\namount attributable to execution of Ms. Sponaugle's fraudulent scheme is at least $40,000 but no\nmore than $95,000. The Court reaches this conclusion through the following steps (and\nsupported by the analysis throughout this Opinion): (i) taking Ms. Hoffinan's final loss\ncalculation as a starting point; (ii) subtracting from Ms. Hoffinan's calculation the categories of\nallegedly fraudulent transactions that the government failed to prove were unauthorized, arriving\nat a maximum amount of fraudulent loss of $123,142.62; and (iii) further reducing Ms.\nHoffinan's loss calculation by 25% to account for at least some of the undoubted additional\nimpact of her unsupported assumptions. This results in a total loss amount of no more than\napproximately $92,356.97.\na. Starting point: Ms. Hoffinan's final loss calculation\nAlthough the Court has explained, at length, why it finds Ms. Hoffinan's loss analysis to\nbe flawed and unpersuasive, the Court has not deemed it to entirely lack merit. It is certainly the\nmost comprehensive analysis in the record. It is also the only analysis conducted by a\nprofessional forensic accountant. The Court does not believe it is plagued by bias or bad faith in\nany manner. Also, the way the case was tried to the jury - and largely the way the subsequent\nsentencing proceedings were conducted - essentially treated Ms. Hoffinan's analysis as a starting\n85point. The Court finds it reasonable and appropriate to do so as well.\nb. Specific adjustments to Ms. Hofbnan's analysis\ni. Early period: January 2012 through October 2014\nIn her final analysis, Ms. Hoffinan identified $35,085.63 of \"unauthorized, personal\nexpenses paid for with the defendant's business credit card or checks written from the AAW\nchecking account before she stopped taking bonuses in October 2014.\" (D.I. 116 at 1 & Ex. 1)\nOf this amount, $32,664.63 is for what the government contends are fraudulent credit card\ntransactions. {Id.) The remaining $2,421 is for checks (minus reimbursements from Sponaugle\nto the practice). {Id.)\nAs is evident from this Opinion, Ms. Hoffinan's credit card loss amount includes many\ntransactions the Court has found the government failed to prove, by the required preponderance\nof the evidence, were actually not authorized. Accordingly, the Court is subtracting from Ms.\nHoffinan's calculations the following categories'^ and the following amounts of loss Ms.\nHoffinan found associated with those categories of credit card transactions for the 2012-2014\nperiod:\nBJ's Wholesale - Household Items $421.00\nB J's Wholesale - Misc. Retail Purchases $71.00\nBreast Cancer Walk sign up (Sponaugle personal - no employees charged $91.80\nAAW)\nCigars $29.99\nFood - Candy/Cookies/Popcom, etc. - personal gifts from Sponaugle from $283.00\nvarious trips (not authorized by owners)\n\" All numbers and categories used in the calculations in this section and the next are taken from\nthe government's submission at D.I. 116 Ex. 1. The descriptions given for each of the categories\nwere provided by Ms. Hoffinan.\n86Gas/Convenience Stores - Double charges on same day $386.97\nGroceries - BJ's Wholesale $ 1,460.00\nHome Decor / Furnishings - (misc. purchases by Sponaugle in Maryland & $305.28\nPennsylvania)\nHome Decor/ Furnishings - Amazon (shipped to Sponaugle residence) $ 126.51\nHome Decor/ Fiimishings - BJ's Wholesale (purchased by Sponaugle) $107.00\nTarget - personal statement shows purchases on same day $896.55\nWalmart - personal statement has personal purchases on same day $2,589.58\nParking - Newark / Wilmington / Philadelphia $99.00\nRepair & Maintenance - Lowes / Home Depot (personal statement shows $40.40\npersonal purchase on same day)\nTOTAL $6,890.08\nThe Coiirt's subtractions total $6,890.08. When subtracted from Ms. Hoffinan's loss of\n$32,664.63, this yields a pre-October 2014 maximum proven loss amount due to fraudulent\ncredit card transactions of $25,774.55.^^\nFor the reasons explained above, the Court has found that the government did not prove\nthat any of the checks Ms. Sponaugle wrote on the AAW checking accoimt were fraudulent.\nThe government identified $888.74 worth of purchases for the 2012-2014 period which Ms.\nSponaugle admitted were \"likely personal.\" (D.I. 105 at 14) This conclusion appears to be\nbased on Ms. Sponaugle's conservative analysis of a government-created Excel spreadsheet of\nher credit card charges. (See D.I. 105 Ex. A at line 91 (purchases at China Star, PetSmart, Pizza\nTower, Burger King, and Sushi House marked by Ms. Sponaugle as \"likely personal\"); see also\nSponaugle Trial Tr. at 1533 (admitting that April 23,2012 purchase at PetSmart was not\nbusiness expense)) Reviewing this exhibit, the Court can only identify six purchases that Ms.\nSponaugle noted as \"likely personal,\" totaling $321.61. It is not clear what additional $567.13 of\nunauthorized purchases the government believes Ms. Sponaugle conceded.\n87Therefore, the amoxmt of loss based on checks written in the 2012-2014 period is zero.\nAltogether, then, the Court's estimate of the amount of loss attributable to Ms.\nSponaugle's fraud for the period of January 2012 through October 2014 is no more than\n$25,774.55.\n11. Later period: October 2014 through March 2018\nIn her final analysis, Ms. Hoffinan identified $206,808.56 of fraudulent \"expenses after\nthe defendant stopped taking bonuses.\" (D.I. 116 at 1 & Ex. 1) Of this amount, $197,495.91\nwere, according to the government, in the form of unauthorized credit card charges. (See id.)\nAs explained above, the Court has found that the most reasonable and appropriate loss\nanalysis - one which is conservative and grounded in the entirety of the record, based on what is\nnecessarily implied by the jury's finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and what the\ngovernment proved by a preponderance of the evidence (considering the totality of evidence\npresented at trial and sentencing) - should not treat as loss the $70,000 in cash bonus payments\nthat Sponaugle did not receive during this period of October 2014 through March 2018, when her\nseparation and divorce proceedings were pending. The government failed to prove by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Ms. Sponaugle was not authorized to take the $70,000 of\nbonuses owed to her during this period m the form of personal expenditures placed on her AAW\ncredit card.\nAdditionally, and as already explained in connection with the early period, Ms.\nHoffinan's credit card loss amounts include expenditures that the Court has found the\ngovernment failed to prove were unauthorized, by the required preponderance of the\nevidence. Accordingly, the Court is subtracting from Ms. Hoffinan's calculations the following\ncategories and the following amounts of loss Ms. Hoffinan found associated with those\n88categories for the later period:\nBJ's Wholesale - Household Items $3,241.00\nBJ's Wholesale - Misc. Retail Purchases $550.00\nCigars $157.92\nFood - Candy/Cookies/Popcom, etc. - personal gifts from Sponaugle from $304.42\nvarious trips (not authorized by owners)\nGas/Convenience Stores - Double charges on same day $ 1,539.92\nGroceries - BJ's Wholesale $12,859.00\nHome Decor / Furnishings - (misc. purchases by Sponaugle in Maryland $2,824.79\n& Pennsylvania)\nHome Decor / Furnishings - Groupon (misc. purchases by Sponaugle) $659.50\nHome Decor/ Furnishings - Amazon (shipped to Sponaugle residence) $6009.96\nHome Decor/ Furnishings - B J's Wholesale (purchased by Sponaugle) $ 1,420.00\nHome Security System $399.99\nParking - Newark / Wilmington / Philadelphia $ 15.65\nTarget - personal statement shows purchases on same day $145.69\nTOTAL $30,127.84\nThe Court's subtractions total $30,127.84. Starting with Ms. Hoffinan's loss amount of\n$197,495.91 and subtracting the $70,000 for bonuses and further subtracting the $30,127.84\nidentified above, the Court arrives at a maximum proven loss amount based on fraudulent credit\ncard transactions for the post-October 2014 period of $97,368.07.\nFor the reasons explained above, the Court has found that the government did not prove\nthat any of the checks Ms. Sponaugle wrote on the AAW checking account were fraudulent.\nTherefore, the amoxmt of loss based on checks written in the 2014-2018 period is zero.\n89Altogether, then, the Court's estimate of the amount of loss attributable to Ms. Sponaugle's\nfraud for the period of October 2014 through March 2018 is no more than $97,368.07.\nc. Total maximum loss amount based on Ms. Hoffman's\nanalysis as a starting point\nBy using Ms. Hoffinan's loss calculation as a starting point, the Court finds that the\nmaximum total loss attributable to Ms. Sponaugle's fraud for the entire period of the fraudulent\nscheme - from on or about January 23,2012 through March 12,2018 - is $123,142.62 (i.e., the\nsum of $25,774.55 and $97,368.07).\nd. The Court will reduce the total maximum loss hy 25 percent\nThe Court will not repeat all the flawed and imsupported assumptions built into Ms.\nHoffinan's analysis. (See supra \u00a7 IV.D.2) The Court has partially accounted for those flaws in\nthe categorical reductions from Ms. Hoffinan's loss amount explained above. Nonetheless, the\nCourt is certain that the subtractions it has made are insufficient to fully correct for all that it has\nfound impersuasive in the FBI's forensic accounting in this case.\nBased on its experience presiding over this case, the Court is confident that if it required\nthe parties to devote more time to the task of analyzing the thousands of entries in Ms.\nHoffinan's chart, even Ms. Hoffinan and the government would come to agree that many\nadditional transactions they are presently contending are fraudulent cannot, in actuality, be\nproven fraudulent. The Court is further confident that if it could devote even more time and\nresources of its own to this endeavor then, again, it would identify many more transactions\nincluded in the government's loss amount that simply have not been proven to be fraudulent.\nThe Court firmly believes that if it had the time to fully apply its findings, as set out in this\nOpinion, to each line of Ms. Hoffinan's chart, it would find many, many of those transactions are\n90ones the government cannot prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, are fraudulent.\nAltematively, if the Court undertook the massive task of constructing a loss amount from\nscratch, transaction by transaction, without using Ms. Hoffinan's calculation as a starting point,\nthe Court strongly believes the loss amoimt it would arrive at (starting from something close to\nzero) would be no more than $95,000.\nThe Court is not required to determine the loss amount with exactitude. See Lacerda,\n958 F.3d at 214; Ali, 508 F.3d at 145; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 app. n.3(C) (\"The court need only make\na reasonable estimate of the loss.\"). Nor is the Court required to indefinitely devote the majority\nof its efforts to this single case. Nor, the Court suspects, do either of the parties wish for\nsentencing to be delayed any further while more efforts are put into determining the correct loss\namount.^* Rather, it is in the interests of justice, and judicial economy, that the Court make its\nbest determination as to loss amoimt, sentence the Defendant, and put this case in a posture in\nwhich at least a large measure of finality will result - at which point one or both parties may also\nseek review from the Court of Appeals.\nGiven all of the foregoing, the Court deems it reasonable, appropriate, expedient, and\nwell-supported by the abundant record and the detailed analysis throughout this Opinion, to\nreduce the maximum loss amount using Ms. Hoffinan's calculation as the starting point\n($123,142.62) by 25 percent. While even larger reductions would be well-supported by the\nrecord, the 25 percent reduction is appropriately \"conservative.\"^^ Accordingly, the maximum\ntotal loss amount proven by the government is $92,356.97.\nAs Accountant Hoffinan said of the FBI, \"we don't have the resources or time to review every\nsingle receipt.\" (Hoffinan Sent. Tr. B at 107)\nSome corroboration for the 25 percent figure and its conservative nature is found in the\ncomparison between the credit card loss amount alleged in the Indictment ($322,652) and the\n91e. Additional evidence corroborates a loss of no more than $95,000\nFor purposes of deterrnining the applicable Sentencing Guideline range, it is not\nnecessary to be absolutely precise in the calculation of the loss amount.^\u00ae Instead, the Court\nneeds only to identify the correct range of loss, and then identify the Guideline corresponding to\nthat range. The analysis the Court has conducted, which yields a maximum total loss of\n$92,356.97, falls into the range set out by SG \u00a7 2B 1.1 (b)(1): more than $40,000 but not more\nthan $95,000. Additional evidence corroborates the Court's conclusion that the amount of loss\nattributable to Ms. Sponaugle's fraud is within this range.\nSponaugle testified that her \"conservative\" review of Ms. Hoffinan's tally of\nunauthorized credit card expenses implies a loss amount of no more than around $99,000. (See\nSponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 284-85) (\"Iff did not feel like it was a business expense or I didn't\nknow, I would just not put anything in there [to indicate expenditure was authorized]; therefore,\nif you add them all up, that's going to be $99,000.\") At an earlier point in the sentencing\nproceedings, defense covmsel submitted a memo contending, again based on the Defendant's\nconservative review of the government's loss memorandum, \"the difference between what the\ngovernment alleges was unauthorized and what she contends was authorized or was not proven\nto be unauthorized is $69,702.\" (D.I. 106 at 2-3) (internal emphasis omitted) Similarly, the\ncorresponding amount in Ms. Hoffinan's final analysis ($230,161), which is a difference of\n$92,491 - a 29 percent reduction from the Indictment amount ($92,491 divided by $230,161).\nMore precision is required in order to determine the amount of restitution owed to the victims.\nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A; SG \u00a7 5El.l(a) (\"In the case of an identifiable victim, the court shall -\nenter a restitution order for the full amount of the victim's loss, if such an order is authorized\nunder... [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A].\"). The parties should, based on their review of this Opinion and\nthe law, provide their views on the appropriate amount of restitution the Court should order in\ntheir forAcoming sentencing memoranda.\n92government has argued that even if one believes all that Ms. Sponaugle has said that still\nsupports a loss finding of around $139,271.13 - an amount which is closer to the Court's finding .\nthan it is to the government's position on loss. (See D.I. 105 at 12-15 (arguing that Defendant\ndid not contest this amount of personal, unauthorized purchases); see also D.I. 107 at 13\n(government arguing \"defendant's admission that [certain] purchases were personal is\nimcontroverted evidence as to $100,000 of personal purchases on her credit card\")) These\nnumbers are generally supportive of the Court's conclusion on loss amount.\nMoreover, reviewing the situation holistically, including AAW's culture, the friendships\nthat developed among the Defendant and the doctors, and the trust AAW placed in the\nDefendant, it seems that what happened here is that at some point Ms. Sponaugle began to take\nsomewhat more than she was entitled to, but not an overwhelming amount more. She abused the\ntrust placed in her, and was sloppier with QuickBooks than she should have been, and also failed\n(in the later period of her fraudulent scheme) to keep track of the amounts she was charging to\nher credit card and taking in lieu of bonuses. (See, e.g., Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 251) (\"That\nwas one of my weaknesses. I never kept a log to show what I spent.\") She also failed to keep\nthe partners informed about what she was doing. (See, e.g., Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 248-50)\n(testifying that partners did not tell her expressly to take bonuses on credit card and admitting\n\"clearly they didn't know that I was putting it all on the card\") All of this manifested itself in\nfraud; criminal conduct that was hard for anyone around her to detect.\nNonetheless, the record does not support the government's implicit theory that Ms.\nSponaugle developed an elaborate, ingenious scheme to defraud AAW and carefully cover her\ntracks. She took advantage of a culture in which the doctor-partners constantly told her not to\nworry about particular purchases, encouraged her to take trips and treat herself well (sometimes\n93at the explicit expense of the practice), and in which it was her role to keep the offices well-\nstocked with supplies and employee incentives, to run programs to encourage a good working\nenvironment, and to make AAW a strong contributor to the community. There were no clear\npolicies about what Ms. Sponaugle could and could not place on her AAW credit card and, at\ntimes, she got greedy and exploited the blurry lines.\nAt several points, the government's loss theory is predicated on an unstated - and wholly\nimpersuasive - assimption that Ms. Sponaugle acted carefully and with premeditation to execute\na well-crafted and massive fi:audulent scheme. The government relies heavily on what it\ncharacterizes as mislabeled QuickBooks entries. For example, horse nail polish was categorized\nas \"auto expense\" and her 40th birthday trip was categorized as staff education. (See Hoffman\nTrial Tr. at 315,1045-46) Ms. Sponaugle explained - with substantial credibility, in the Court's\nview - that the QuickBooks system (including at least many of its labels) had been set up before\nshe arrived at AAW, and the system often defaulted to pulling up the same label as a given type\nof expenditure had been classified under a previous time; and she received no real training in\nQuickBooks and did not fully understand how it worked. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1247,1486-87;\nsee also Hofi&nan Sent. Tr. B at 145) The government suggests she hid unauthorized purchases\nin various QuickBooks columns, to conceal her large amount of firaud, when the reality seems to\nbe that she was unorthodox and somewhat careless in how she did her categorization.'^\nMs. Sponaugle further explained that she placed purchases into various QuickBooks categories\nas placeholders when a credit card payment was due, and before she had the final credit card\nstatements, which were needed to correctly categorize some items. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1452-\n53,1491-92) Later, when she had the statements in hand and could confirm what any previously\nunknown purchases actually were, she would reclassify some items into other QuickBooks\ncategories. (Id. at 1491-92, 1495-98,1563-64)\n94Similarly, the government implies that Ms. Sponaugle had meticulous insight into the distinction\nbetween an audit and a reconciliation, a contention that is not home out by the evidence-^^\nThe government's evidence of concealment was weak. While the government insisted\nthat Ms. Sponaugle prevented the doctors from accessing AAW's credit card and bank account\nstatements, the government did not prove these allegations. It is beyond dispute that all of these\nrecords belong to AAW; it is implausible that a phone call (or maybe two or three calls, or at\nworst a visit to a branch office) from one or more of the doctor-partners to these financial\nThe government also made much of the fact that there were no \"audits\" of AAW between\n2012 and 2018, when the partners thought that the practice was being audited. (See McCracken\nTrial Tr. at 415-18; McCullough Trial Tr. at 688) Ms. Sponaugle thought that she had the\noversight the partners wanted. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1243,1563) (\"I again believed that if\nthere was something in error, that my accountant would be overseeing it and [would] tell me that\nthere was an error.\") She explained:\n... I thought I was being looked at [by the accountants]\nevery month.\n... When I took over the books in '05 or '06,1 told them I\ndidn't want to do it. I had no experience doing it. And the only\nway I would ever do it is if somebody oversaw me every month,\nand they are like no problem. And it never changed. I never got a\ndifferent paper saying we're going to change what we're doing or\nwe're not going to do this part or we're not going to do that part. I\nnever received that.\n(Sponaugle Sent. Tr. C at 277-78)\nThe accounting witnesses explained the differences between an \"audit\" and mere\n\"reconciliation\" and testified that AAW was only subject to monthly bank reconciliations.\n(Cetrulo Trial Tr. at 886-89; Storm Trial Tr. at 975-78) A reconciliation ensures that a\ncompany's general ledger matches up with the bank statement, while an audit is an investigation\nof a company's operations. (See id.) The government presented no evidence that Ms.\nSponaugle, or the average lay person, understood this distinction, much less that Ms. Sponaugle\nfiendishly exploited these differences to further her fraudulent aims.\n95institutions would not have resulted in the practice being given access to its own accounts. (See\ngenerally Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1500; McCracken Sent. Tr. A at 190-95) Furthermore, the\nrecord supports a conclusion that on the only occasion when a doctor asked Ms. Sponaugle for\naccess to financial records - in March 2018, shortly after Defendant gave notice she would be\nresigning from her position - Ms. Sponaugle pulled the records together and left them in the\noffice of the requesting parmer. Dr. McCracken. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1499; McCracken Sent.\nTr. A at 192-95; see also GX62 & GX63 (text messages on March 3-5,2018 between Dr.\nMcCracken and Sponaugle showing Sponaugle helping provide access)) While Dr. McCracken\ntestified that she never received the records (McCracken Trial Tr. at 456-57), she could not\ndismiss the possibility that Ms. Sponaugle left the records in her office - as Ms. Sponaugle said\nshe did, and as contemporaneous text messages from Ms. Sponaugle to Dr. McCracken seems to\ncorroborate (see GX62 (\"I pulled all ur cc receipts. I will make sure you hav them mon.\"); see\nalso Def. Sent. Ex. 32 (February 9,2018 text message from Defendant to Dr. McCracken saying\nshe had put credit card receipts on doctor's desk)). The government's assumption seems to be\nthat Ms. Sponaugle was so clever that she pretended to leave the records for Dr. McCracken and\nthen covered her tracks with these (false) text messages. Nothing in the record supports viewing\nMs. Sponaugle as this type of hardened, seasoned criminal.\nThe government's portrayal of Ms. Sponaugle as a massive fraudster is further\nundermined by several other undisputed facts. In the Court's view, an individual who had spent\nyears carefiilly hidmg widespread fraud would likely not have taken another job in the very same\nbuilding as the \"scene of her crime.\" Nor would such a person likely have freely offered her\nconsulting services to the victim of her massive crime for months following her resignation.\n(Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1511) Nor does it strike the Court as plausible that if Ms. Sponaugle\n96committed nearly as much fraud as the government contends, that she would also have\n(i) immediately asked about the $60,000 of bonuses she was owed when, without warning, she\nwas terminated; (ii) hired an employment attorney to try to get back from the practice monies she\nclaimed she was owed; and (iii) reached out, on her own and through her attorney, to try to get\nthe doctors to talk to her about what they thought she did wrong. (Sponaugle Trial Tr. at 1515;\nAllen Trial Tr. at 1619-20)\nAll of this, in the Court's view, corroborates the Court's conclusion that the government\nfailed to prove a loss amount exceeding $95,000.\n97V. SENTENCING GUIDELINES COMPUTATION\nBased on the Court's rulings above, the Sentencing Guidelines calculation is as follows:\nOffense Level: 15\nBase offense level: 7\nThe guideline for a violation of 18 U.S.C.

CONCLUSION\nMuch litigation stems from competing perspectives on the same set of facts. Individuals'\nperceptions of the same realities may often, and easily, differ. Individuals' motivations\nsometimes also skew their understanding of what they have observed. Human memory, too, is\nfar from infallible.\nFor these and similar reasons, the imdersigned Judge believes that the victims in this case\ngenuinely and sincerely think that Ms. Sponaugle defrauded them out of himdreds of thousands\nof dollars.^^ The Court also believes that the FBI investigators and the United States Attorney's\nOffice prosecutors likewise think that the evidence establishes a large-scale, long-running\nfraudulent scheme, at least approaching what the victims subjectively experienced.^'* But the\nCourt further believes - and finds, based on the extensive record, including its own assessments\nof credibility during the lengthy sentencing proceedings, at which each of the main testifying\nwitnesses was examined at length by the government, by defense coxmsel, and by the Court -\nthat the Defendant did not intend any enormous amount of fraud. The Court believes the\nDefendant knew she was exploiting her generous employers for something more than she was\nThe Court believes that when the doctors at AAW looked at the credit card statements in the\ndays immediately after Ms. Sponaugle tendered her resignation, they quickly concluded - in\ngood faith - that they had been duped, that they had allowed her to control the financial activities\nof the practice without supervision for a dozen years, and that she had abused that trust by\ndefrauding them. The doctors quickly decided, for reasons they believed were just and\nnecessary, to go to the police, to hire a lawyer, and to terminate Ms. Sponaugle, all to remove a\nthreat as efficiently and quickly as possible, putting aside - as they must have deemed prudent -\nany personal affection for, and any fiiendship, business, and financial relationships they had with\nMs. Sponaugle.\nThe Court believes that the Delaware State Police, FBI, and US AO saw in this case a once\nthriving female-owned-and-operated OB-GYN practice that had been gruesomely victimized by\nits own trusted CEO. This looked to them, at all pertinent times, like a massive, long-running\nfraud, perpetrated by a criminal who needed to be stopped.\n99entitled to, likely justifying to herself that she deserved it, given how much she did for the\npractice, how much she sacrificed in her personal life, and how much money she helped AAW\nmake. The xmdersigned Judge believes this is what the jury found as well.\nDefi-auding a crucial health-care provider of up to $95,000 over six years is a serious\ncrime. Ms. Sponaugle is not innocent; she is a convicted federal felon and will be sentenced as\nsuch. She will also live the remainder of her life with that stain on her reputation. But the\ngovernment did not come close to proving that Ms. Sponaugle defrauded AAW of himdreds of\nthousands of dollars or that her criminal conduct (as opposed to her departure firom the practice)\nwas a significant factor in the fate AAW siaffered after her departure.\nThe Court will have all of this, as well as whatever additional arguments the parties wish\nto present, in mind as it makes the remaining difficult decision in this case as to what is the\nappropriate sentence for Ms. Sponaugle for the offense for which she was convicted.\n100IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nV.\nKIMBERLY SPONAUGLE,\nDefendant.Crim.No. 19-103-LPS\nORDER\nAt Wilmington, this 15th day of August, 2022, consistent with and for the reasons stated\nin the Opinion issued this same date,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant's objections to the presentence investigation\nreport (D.I. 115) are SUSTAINED IN PART and OVERRULED IN PART, as detailed in the\nOpinion.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that at the sentencing hearing, scheduled for August 31,\n2022 at 10:00 a.m., the Court will sentence Defendant based on a Criminal History Category of 1,\nan Offense Level of 15, and an Advisory Guideline Range of 18-24 months of imprisonment.\nHONORABLE LEONARD P.
