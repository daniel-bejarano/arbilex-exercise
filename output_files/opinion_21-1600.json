Civil Action No. 21-1600-RGA\nKONA CONCEPTS, INC., 5\n\nDefendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff.\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this declaratory judgment action arising from the parties\u2019\ncontractual obligations is Enzolytics, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cENZC\u201d or \u201cCounterclaim Defendant\u201d) Motion to\nDismiss (\u201cMotion\u201d), (D.I. 27), Kona Concepts, Inc. \u201cKona\u201d or \u201cCounterclaim Plaintiff\u2019) First\nAmended Counterclaim (\u201cFACC\u201d) alleging breach of contract. (D.I. 26).! For the following\nreasons, I recommend GRANTING ENZC\u2019s Motion.\nll. BACKGROUND\n\nOn March 9, 2017, Kona entered into a Convertible Promissory Note (\u201cNote\u201d) with Eco-\nPetroleum Solutions, Inc. (\u201cEco-Petroleum Solutions\u201d) which Kona alleges is ENZC\u2019s\npredecessor in interest. (D.I. 26 at J] 5-6, 28; see D.I. 16) According to the Note, Eco-\n\nPetroleum Solutions received from Kona $25,000.00 at a 12% annual interest rate from Kona.?\n\n' The briefing for the Motion is as follows: Counterclaim Defendant\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 28),\nCounterclaim Plaintiff's answering brief (D.I. 30), and Counterclaim Defendant\u2019s reply brief\n(LL 32).\n\n? There is a discrepancy between the FACC and the Note regarding the loan amount and interest\nrate. According to the FACC, Kona alleges the amount was $100,000.00 at an 8% annual\ninterest rate. (D.I. 26 at J 29)\n(DI. 16 at ff 1, 9) In return, Eco-Petroleum Solutions promised to pay the required principal\nand interest. (D.I. 26 at { 29; D.I. 16 at J 1)\n\nAdditionally, under the terms of the Note, Kona possessed the option to convert the Note\ninto shares of common stock rather than demand payment. (D.I. 26 at { 30; D.I. 16 at ff 1, 3)\nThe Note did not impose any time limitations on Kona\u2019s ability to convert the note, providing\nKona with full discretion on whether, and when, it chose to exercise this right. (D.I. 26 at 31;\nD.L. 16 at \u00a7{ 1, 7) The Note is governed by New York law. (id. at ] 9)\n\nAccording to Kona, in May of 2020, it communicated with Billy V. Ray (\u201cRay\u201d), an\n\u201cofficer\u201d of ENZC, concerning the prospect of providing additional funding. (D.I. 26 at {{ 7, 40)\nRay responded that ENZC was not in need of funding but might be in the future. (/d. at 7 41)\nThroughout September and October of 2020, Kona discussed financing projects with ENZC\nofficers, including Ray. (/d. at {J 43-48)\n\nOn November 14 and 15, 2020, Kona alleges it communicated with Ray about its\nintention to convert the Note into shares of common stock. (/d. at {] 49-50) On November 15,\n2020, Ray responded with an email telling Kona that ENZC needed an opinion letter from them\nprior to any conversion and that ENZC would not initiate any conversions before November 26,\n2020. (id. at 52) Kona claims ENZC failed to issue the shares of common stock, thus\nbreaching the contract. (Jd. at {] 60, 64) Kona alleges that had the Note been converted, it\nwould have received 9,703,720 shares of ENZC. (/d. at J 67)\n\nKona alleges that on or about November 19, 2020, a merger occurred wherein ENZC\nissued shares of common stock on favorable terms to other entities upon conversion of their\n\nnotes, without providing notice to Kona. (/d. at [J 34-35, 53-55, 59, 63) Kona contends that\nthe intended purpose of the merger was to defraud certain stakeholders, such as Kona. (/d. at 1]\n39, 56)\n\nIn its Declaratory Judgment Complaint in this action, ENZC asserts that it was not a party\nto the Note, is not the successor to Eco-Petroleum Solutions, and has not assumed the liabilities\nof the Note. (See e.g., D.I. 5 at FJ 12, 20, 27, 31, 33) ENZC alleges that Eco-Petroleum\nSolutions is a predecessor to ENZC Sub, Inc. (Jd. at \u00a2 13) ENZC is the publicly traded parent of\nENZC Sub, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary.> (Id. at 1 26, 32)\n\nKona continues to assert that ENZC is in breach of the Note. (/d. at J] 58-59) On\nNovember 12, 2021, ENZC instituted this Declaratory Judgment action. (D.I. 1) ENZC filed an\nAmended Complaint on December 6, 2021. (D.I. 5) Kona responded with its Answer and\nCounterclaim on March 4, 2022. (D.I. 13) On April 19, 2022, Kona filed the FACC, the\noperative pleading at issue in this Motion. (D.I. 26) ENZC moved to dismiss the FACC on May\n6, 2022. (D.I. 27) This court has diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) because\nENZC is a Delaware corporation and Kona is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of\nbusiness in Boca, Raton, Florida. (D.I. 1 at \u00a2\u00a7 2-3)\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d 59,\n\n64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n3 The issue of whether ENZC is contractually obligated for the Note is not before the court in the\npending Motion which only concerns whether the allegations in the FACC are facially plausible.\n\n3\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jgbal, 556 U.S. at\n679.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nUnder New York law, \u201c[t]he essential elements for pleading . . . breach of contract are the\nexistence of a contract, the plaintiff's performance pursuant to the contract, the defendant's\nbreach of his or her contractual obligations, and damages resulting from the breach.\u201d Dee v.\nRakower, 112 A.D.3d 204, 208-09 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013). In support of its Motion, ENZC\n\nmakes three arguments: (1) Kona failed to plead sufficient facts showing ENZC was obligated\nunder section 3 of the Note to provide Kona notice prior to the merger, (2) Kona failed to allege\nthat it satisfied the notice requirement in section 6 of the Note, a condition precedent to Kona\u2019s\nright to convert, and (3) the FACC is redundant of the Declaratory Judgment Complaint. (D.I.\n28 at 4-9)\n\nA. Kona Fails to Plausibly Allege ENZC Was Obligated to Provide Notice\n\nENZC argues Kona\u2019s breach of contract claim should be dismissed because there is no\nexpress contractual obligation imposed on ENZC to provide Kona with notice of the merger.\n(Id. at 4-5) Kona argues in its answering brief that the implied covenant of good faith and fair\ndealing creates an \u201cimplicit\u201d notice requirement based upon the triggering of its conversion right\nunder section 3 of the Note. (D.I. 30 at 5\u20146)\n\nSection 3 of the Note provides:\n\nThe Note holder (the \u201cHolder\u201d) in its sole discretion may elect to convert the Note into\n\nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock. . . .The Holder\u2019s right to convert the Note will\n\nbe triggered upon the occurrence of any one of the following: (i) 6 months from the date\n\nof said note, (ii) change in control [of] the Company; (iii) the filing of a registration\n\nstatement or offering, or (iv) election by the Holder.\n(I. 16 at \u00a5 3)\n\nKona argues that its conversion right under the Note is meaningless without requiring\nENZC to provide it with notice of an event under Section 3(ii) or (iii) triggering the right to\nconvert the Note. (D.I. 30 at 5-6) Kona claims that it was deprived of the benefit of its bargain\nbecause it was unaware of the merger and was actively misled by ENZC about its conversion\nright. (/d.) Thus, Kona alleges that ENZC breached the notice requirement implicit in the Note.\n(D.L. 26 at FJ 58, 63)\n\nKona relies on two cases in support of its argument that the Note is subject to an implied\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. (D.I. 30 at 5-6) See Geren v. Quantum Chem. Corp.,\n832 F. Supp. 728 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); Perkins & Will P\u2019ship v. Syska et al. (\u201cPerkins\u201d), 50 A.D.2d\n226 (N.Y. App. Div. 1975). Every contract governed by New York law contains an implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing to ensure the parties receive the benefit of their bargain.\nGeren, 832 F. Supp. at 731. \u201cThe covenant is violated when a party to a contract acts in a\nmanner that, although not expressly forbidden by any contractual provision, would deprive the\nother of the right to receive the benefits under their agreement.\u201d Jd. at 732.\n\nOther than reciting legal conclusions, Kona fails to explain the relevance of these cases to\nthe allegations in its pleading. Geren does not support Kona\u2019s argument because, unlike Kona\u2019s\npleading, the pleading in Geren contained three similar counts alleging breach of an implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing which the court ultimately dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim. Jd. at 731-34. Furthermore, the court in Geren explained that the implied covenant\ncannot be used to create a substantive provision in the contract that was not included by the\nparties. Id. at 733.\n\nThe court further finds that the Perkins decision does not help Kona avoid dismissal of its\npleading. Perkins involved the implicit requirement for providing reasonable notice of a demand\nfor arbitration pursuant to a construction contract. 50 A.D.2d at 228-30. The court found that\nthe implied covenant of good faith warranted reading into the contractual arbitration procedure a\nreasonable notice requirement to afford a meaningful opportunity for participation by the\ncontracting party and found such notice was sufficient on the facts of the case. Jd. at 230-31.\nThe case has no relevance to the Note at issue here or the determination of whether an implicit\nnotice requirement is sufficiently pled.\n\nKona relies on one paragraph in its FACC that it contends is an adequate allegation that\n\nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing warrants reading into the Note an implicit\nobligation for ENZC to provide reasonable notice and that the obligation was breached. (D.I. 30\nat 6) The sole allegation is:\n\nImplicit in sections 3(i) and 3(iii) is that Enzolytics [] give notice to Kona of any\n\nimpending \u201cchange in control of the company\u201d or \u201cfiling of a registration statement or\n\noffering.\n(D.L. 26 at | 58)* Kona pleads no facts alleging what it contends is the action that triggered\nnotice or when it should have been given the notice it claims is required under this \u201cimplicit\u201d\ncontractual obligation. Pleading a bare legal conclusion that ENZC breached an implicit notice\nrequirement in the Note does not satisfy the Jgbal/Twombly pleading standard. See Igbal, 556\nUSS. at 664 (\u201cWhile legal conclusions can provide the complaint\u2019s framework, they must be\nsupported by factual allegations.\u201d).\n\nB. Kona\u2019s New Theory of Equitable Estoppel Has Not Been Plausibly Pled\n\nKona alleges that ENZC breached the Note by failing to issue shares of the successor\ncompany. (D.I. 26 at FJ 60, 64) Kona fails to identify the successor company or the provisions\nof the Note it claims were breached. ENZC argues that the FACC fails to state a claim that\nENZC breached an obligation to issue shares because Kona failed to satisfy the condition\nprecedent of providing formal notice as required by section 6 of the Note. (D.L. 28 at 6-7)\nSection 6 states:\n\nAny notice, other communication or payment required or permitted hereunder shall be in\n\nwriting and shall be deemed to have been given upon delivery if personally delivered or\n\nupon deposit if deposited in the United States mail for mailing by registered or certified\n\nmail, postage prepaid, and addressed [to the addresses written in the Note].\n(11. 16 at J 6)\n\n4 The court notes section 3(i) deals with a triggering event of \u201c6 months from the date of said\nnote.\u201d (D.I. 16) Kona has not argued any alleged breach of section 3(i) in its answering brief.\n(D.I. 30) The court assumes Kona\u2019s reference to section 3(i) is in error.\n\n7\nUnder New York law, \u201c[i]t is well settled that no action for breach of contract lies where\nthe party seeking to enforce the contract has failed to perform a specified condition precedent.\u201d\nCarr v. Birnbaum, 75 A.D.3d 972, 973 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010).\n\nIn its answering brief, Kona fails to address the written notice requirement for conversion\nin section 6 of the Note nor does the FACC plead any facts suggesting Kona complied with the\nnotice requirement. (See D.I. 30; D.I. 26) Instead, Kona argues for the first time that ENZC\nshould be estopped from raising lack of notice as a defense for not converting the Note because\nKona detrimentally relied on Ray\u2019s representation that ENZC was not initiating any conversions\nuntil November 26, 2020, at the earliest. (D.I. 30 at 6-8)\n\nENZC argues Kona has insufficiently pled the elements of equitable estoppel because\nthere is nothing in the FACC alleging that Ray had apparent authority to bind ENZC or that\nKona reasonably relied on Ray\u2019s representations to its detriment. (D.J. 32 at 4-6)\n\nTo establish an equitable estoppel claim under New York law, the party to be estopped\nmust (1) have made a false representation or concealed material facts; (2) had the intention that\nthis misrepresentation would be acted upon by the other party; and (3) have knowledge of the\nreal facts. Rich v. Orlando, 128 A.D.3d 1330, 1331 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015). Further, the party\nasserting estoppel must show: \u201c(1) lack of knowledge of the true facts; (2) good faith reliance;\nand (3) a change of position.\u201d Jd. See also Fundamental Portfolio Advisors, Inc. v. Tocqueville\nAsset Management, L.P., 850 N.E.2d 653, 659 (N.Y. 2006) (discussing the purpose of the\ndoctrine is to prevent injustice to a party who justifiably relied upon another\u2019s words or conduct\nto their disadvantage).\n\nKona argues that ENZC \u201cstrung Kona along until the [m]erger\u201d occurring sometime\n\naround November 19, 2020, in order to avoid its contractual obligations under the Note. (D.I. 30\nat 2) In its FACC, Kona alleges it had various email communications with Ray in which Kona\nexpressed its intention to convert the Note, but Ray purposefully stalled for time such as by\nputting off the conversion due to his \u201csituation\u201d and by requiring Kona to provide an opinion\nletter. (D.I. 26 at {{ 49-52)\u00b0 In one of the emails, Kona alleges Ray indicated ENZC \u201cwould not\nbe initiating any conversions until November 26 at the earliest.\u201d (Id. at { 52)\n\nEven if the court considers the full content of the emails, they are not sufficient to plead\nthe equitable estoppel theory Kona now asserts. The FACC fails to allege any facts supporting\nthe elements of equitable estoppel nor does the FACC even mention the phrase. Kona\u2019s attempt\nto supply the details in its answering brief falls short of its obligation to include the elements of\nequitable estoppel in a facially plausible pleading. See Pa. ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc.,\n836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1998) (\u201c[T]he complaint may not be amended by the briefs in\nopposition to a motion to dismiss.\u201d); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8.\n\nKona argues it has adequately pled good faith reliance on Ray\u2019s representations because\nRay had apparent authority as director or officer of ENZC. (D.I. 30 at 7-8) Kona\u2019s argument\nthat Ray\u2019s title imbues him with authority is unsupported.\u00ae The only allegation in the FACC is\nthat Ray is \u201can individual and an officer of [ENZC].\u201d (D.I. 26 at] 7) There is nothing further\n\nalleged about his apparent authority or Kona\u2019s reliance on it for an equitable estoppel claim.\n\n> The FACC references the content of the emails in paragraphs 49-52 but does not attach them to\nthe pleading. The two emails in issue (one of which is redacted) are incorporated into Kona\u2019s\nanswering brief. (See D.I. 30 at 3) ENZC objects to their consideration. (D.I. 32 at 1-2) But\nthe court finds they are integral to the FACC and may be considered with the pleading for\npurposes of the pending Motion. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1426\n(noting a court may consider \u201cdocument{[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint\u201d\nwithout converting the motion into one for summary judgment).\n\n\u00a7 Kona cites to Goldston v. Bandwidth Tech. Corp., 52 A.D.3d 360 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008) to\nsupport its argument that Ray acted with apparent authority. (D.I. 30 at 7) But Kona\u2019s reliance\non the case is misplaced because it has no relevance to the sufficiency of the pleading in issue.\n\n9\nThus, even when construing the FACC in the light most favorable to Kona, the FACC\ncannot survive dismissal based on an equitable estoppel theory raised for the first time in Kona\u2019s\nanswering brief. See Abercrombie v. Andrew College, 438 F. Supp. 2d. 243, 265-68 (S.D.N.Y.\n2006) (dismissing the plaintiff's claims relying on the doctrine of equitable estoppel because the\nplaintiff failed to adequately plead the elements); Anderson Co. v. Devine, 202 A.D.2d 382, 382\n(N.Y. App. Div. 1994) (affirming an order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because\nthe plaintiffs failed to assert equitable estoppel in their complaint).\n\n(on ENZC\u2019s Redundancy Argument is Rendered Moot\n\nFinally, ENZC argues that the court should dismiss Kona\u2019s FACC because it is redundant\nof ENZC\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Complaint. (D.I. 28 at 7-9). Kona contends that its pleading\nis not redundant because the FACC does not seek a declaratory judgment but alleges a cause of\naction for breach of contract. (D.I. 30 at 8-9)\n\nENZC correctly identifies the mirror image legal standard that the court applies when\nresolving a motion to dismiss a redundant counterclaim. (D.I. 28 at 7) See Peloton Interactive,\nInc. v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., No. 20-cv-01535-RGA, 2021 WL 3794829 (D. Del. Aug.\n26, 2021). Without citing to any case authorities to support its position, Kona argues that its\ncounterclaim is not redundant because it relies on different facts than ENZC and seeks a different\nremedy, i.e., money damages and not declaratory relief. (D.I. 30 at 8-9) ENZC has not refuted\nKona\u2019s argument that its demand for money damages distinguishes the breach of contract claim\nfrom the Declaratory Judgment action. (See D.I. 32 at 6-7)\n\nThe court finds it unnecessary to address the redundancy argument because it has\n\nrecommended dismissal of the FACC based on the pleading defects discussed, supra.\n\n10\nAlternatively, Kona requests leave to amend its pleading a second time. (D.I. 30 at 9)\nENZC has not addressed Kona\u2019s request and the court finds amendment would not be futile. See\nIn re Burlington Coat Factory Secs. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1434 (\u201cleave to amend shall be freely\ngiven\u201d unless amendment is futile). Therefore, the court grants leave to amend. The amended\npleading shall be served no later than seven (7) days following the deadline for Objections\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) or upon further Order of the court following a ruling on\nObjections, if any.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend GRANTING ENZC\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. (D.I.\n27) Ll also recommend GRANTING Kona\u2019s leave to amend its counterclaim. (D.1. 30 at 9)\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ.
