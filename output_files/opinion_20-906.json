Corporation (\u201cVirco \u201d or \u201cPlaintiff\u201d)  \nagainst Defendants SSI Liquidating, Inc. and School Specialty, LLC  (\u201cSchool Specialty \u201d or \n\u201cDefendants\u201d), Virco alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 7,147,284 (the \u201c' 284 \npatent\u201d) and 10,537,180 (the \u201c'1 80 patent\u201d and collectively with the ' 284 patent, \u201cthe asserted \npatents\u201d or the \u201cpatents -in-suit\u201d).  Presently before the Court is the matter of claim construction.  \n(D.I. 67; D.I.  70)  The Court recommends that the District Court adopt the constructions set forth \nbelow.  \nI. BACKGROUND  Virco commenced this action on July 2, 2020.  (D.I. 1)  The case was thereafter referred \nto the Court by then- District Judge Leonard P. Stark to hear and resolve all pretrial matters \nthrough the case -dispositive motion deadline.  (D.I. 16 )   \nVirco  alleges that School Specialty\u2019s furniture products infringe claims  1-2, 6-8 and 12-\n18 of the '284 patent  and claims 1 -6, 8 and 10- 13 of the '180 patent .  (D.I.  110 at \u00b6\u00b6 15- 16; D.I. \n65 at 1)  The '284 patent  is entitled \u201cStudent Desk Chair With Rockers Rails\u201d and it issued on \nDecember 12, 2006.  (D.I. 69, ex. 2)   The '284 patent  generally covers cantilevered rocking \nchairs.  ( Id. at Abstract ; D.I. 65 at 1)  The '180 patent  is entitled \u201cLow Profile Rocking Chair\u201d 2 \n and it issued on January 21, 2020.  ( D.I. 69, ex. 1)1  The '180 patent generally covers floor \nrocking chairs.  ( Id., col. 1:15- 18; D.I. 65 at 2)   Further details regarding the asserted patents will \nbe provided below in Section III.      \nOn October 1, 2021, the parties filed their joint claim construction brief.  (D.I. 65)  The \nCourt conducted a Markman hearing by videoconference on November 10, 2021.  (D.I. 81 \n(hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d))    \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nIt is well- understood that \u201c[a] claim in a patent provides the metes and bounds of the right \nwhich the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from making, using, or selling the protected invention.\u201d  Corning Glass Works v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc ., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 \n(Fed. Cir. 1989).  Claim construction is generally a question of law, although subsidiary fact finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 326- 27 \n(2015).   \nThe Court should typically assign claim terms their \u201cordinary and customary meaning[,]\u201d \nwhich is \u201cthe meaning that the term[s] would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art [\u2018POSITA\u2019] in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the \npatent application.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005)  (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted) .  However, when determining the ordinary meaning of \nclaim terms, the Court should not extract and isolate those terms from the context of the patent; rather , it should endeavor to reflect their \u201cmeaning to the ordinary artisan after reading the entire \n \n 1  The asserted patents appear on the docket in this action more than once.  Citations \nto the patents hereafter will simply be to the \u201c '284 patent \u201d and \u201c'180 patent .\u201d 3 \n patent.\u201d  Id.  at 1321; see also Eon Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. Silver Spring Networks, Inc., 815 \nF.3d 1314, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  \nIn proceeding with claim construction, the Court should look first and foremost to the \nlanguage of the claims themselves, because \u201c[i]t is a bedrock principle of patent law that the \nclaims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1312 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  For example, the \ncontext in which a term is used in a claim may be \u201chighly instructive.\u201d  Id.  at 1314.  In addition, \n\u201c[o]ther claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted, can . . . be valuable\u201d in discerning the meaning of a particular claim term.  Id.   This is \u201c[b]ecause claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent, [and so] the usage of a ter m in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\u201d  Id.  Moreover, \u201c[d]ifferences \namong claims can also be a useful guide[,]\u201d as when \u201cthe presence of a dependent claim that \nadds a particular limitation gives rise to a presu mption that the limitation in question is not \npresent in the independent claim.\u201d  Id.  at 1314- 15.   \nIn addition to the words of the claims, the Court should look to other intrinsic evidence.  \nFor example, the Court should analyze the patent specification, which \u201cmay reveal a special definition given to a claim term . . . that differs from the meaning [that term] would otherwise \npossess\u201d or may reveal an intentional disclaimer of claim scope.  Id.  at 1316.  Even if the \nspecification does not contain such revelations, it \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim \nconstruction analysis.  Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\u201d  Id.  at 1315 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  That said, however, \nthe specification \u201cis not a substitute for, nor can it be used to rewrite, the chosen claim language.\u201d  SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d 870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  And 4 \n a court should also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution history, if it is in evidence, because it \u201ccan \noften inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood \nthe invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution[.]\u201d  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1317. \nExtrinsic ev idence, \u201cincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned \ntreatises[,]\u201d can also \u201cshed useful light on the relevant art[.]\u201d  Id.  (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted).  Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \u201cle ss significant than the \nintrinsic record in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\u201d  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted); accord Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 981 (Fed. Cir. 1995).     \nIn utilizing these resources during claim construction, courts should keep in mind that \n\u201c[t]he construction that stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns with the patent\u2019s description of the invention will be, in the end, the correct construction.\u201d   Renishaw PLC \nv. Marposs Societa\u2019 per Azioni , 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The parties set out four disputed terms for the Court\u2019s review.  The Court takes up the \nterms in the order in which they were argued.    \n A. \u201cside support \u201d  \n The first disputed term , \u201cside support [,]\u201d appears, inter alia , in claims 1 and 13 of the \n'284 patent .  Exemplary claim 1 recites:   \n  1.  A rocking chair comprising:  \n(a) a seating s urface having a right side, a left side, a forward \nportion, and a rearward portion, the seating s urface being adapted \nto support a user thereon;  \n(b) a backrest disposed above the seating s urface;  5 \n (c) a forward flexing s upport carriage disposed below the seating \nsurface and adapted to s upport the seating s urface above a floor, \nthe support carriage comprising:  \n(i) a left side rocker rail having a forward portion and a rearward \n portion;  \n(ii) an opposed right side rocker rail having a forward portion and a \nrearward portion;  \n(iii) a left side support  extending downward from the rearward \nportion of the left side of the seating surface to the rearward portion of the left side rocker rail; and  \n(iv) a right side support  extending downward from the rearward \nportion of the right side of the seating surface to the rearward portion of the right side rocker rail,  wherein both rocker rails are disposed generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of the seating s urface, and wherein the seating \nsurface is cantilevered by the left side s upport and the right side \nsupport of the s upport carriage, the s upport carriage providing \nforward flexure of the rocking chair and allowing the seating surface to tip forwardly. \n \n('284 patent, col. 5:6- 31 (emphasis added))   The parties\u2019 competing proposed constructions for \n\u201cside support \u201d are set out in the chart below:   \nTerm   Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed \nConstruction  Defendants\u2019 Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201cside support \u201d \n(\u201cleft side support \u201d; \u201cright \nside support \u201d)   Plain and ordinary meaning ; \nno claim construction is \nnecessary.   \n \nIn the alternative, the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cleft side support\u201d and \u201cright side support\u201d could respectively be articulated as \u201ca portion of the su pport carriage on the \nleft side of the chair\u201d and \u201ca portion of the support carriage on the right side of \nthe chair\u201d  \u201cadditional tubular support \nstrut, separate from the rocker rails or legs\u201d  \n (D.I. 65 at 19- 20)  The parties\u2019 dispute with respect to this term is whether the left and right side \nsupports  must include a strut like that depicted in the circle below  (as School Specialty argues) , 6 \n ('284 patent, F IG. 1 (annotated)), or whether (as Virco contends) the side support s need not \ninclude that kind of strut  structure , (D.I. 65 at 21, 24; Tr. at 14, 28) .   \n \nFor the following reasons, the Court concludes that the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cside \nsupport\u201d does not align with School Specialty\u2019s proposed construction.  \nThe Court first looks to the claim language , which is helpf ul to understanding more about \nthe left and right side supports.  School Specialty \u2019s briefing  at first suggested that only the type \nof strut structure circled above amounts to a side support .  (D.I. 65 at 24 -25)  However, as Virco \nrightly retorted, this  cannot be true , in light of the plain language of the claims.  ( Id. at 27 -28)  \nThe claim language tells us that the left and right side supports are components of the support carriage, which is below the seating surface and serves to support the seating s urface above the \nfloor.  ( '284 patent, col. 5:11- 24)  In addition to the side supports, the support carriage is also \ncomprised of a left side rocker rail and a right side rocker rail, both having a forward portion and a rearward portion.  ( Id., col. 5:13- 16)  And importantly, t he claims also tell us that the side \nsupports extend downward from the rearward portion of the left/right side of the seating surface, to the rearward portion of the left/right side rocker rail .  (Id., col. 5:17- 24)  We know from the \n8 \n dictate that the strut structure must be a required component of the s ide supports ?  In asserting \nthat it does, School Specialty makes two arguments, but neither are persuasive.   \n First, School Specialty points out that all of the '284 patent\u2019s figures de pict such \nadditional support struts.  ( D.I. 65 at 24, 32; Tr. at 24, 26, 42, 48)  That may be so, but \nnevertheless, these figures cannot do th e work  that School Specialty asks of them .  (D.I. 65 at 26-\n27; Tr. at 14- 15, 45- 46)  It is a bedrock principle of claim construction that courts may not limit a \npatent claim to what is depicted in a patent\u2019s figures , unless the patentee has clearly \ndemonstrated an intent to limit the claim scope.  Arlington Indus., Inc.  v. Bridgeport  Fittings, \nInc., 632 F.3d 1246, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 2011)  (\u201cWhile the drawings of the adaptor consistently \ndepict an incomplete circle, drawings in a patent need not illustrate the full scope of the \ninvention.\u201d) ; MBO  Lab\u2019 ys, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson  & Co., 474 F.3d 1323, 1333 (Fed. Cir. \n2007)  (\u201cThe patent figures all depict the flange connected mainly to the outside, but patent \ncoverage is not necessarily limited to inventions that look like the ones in the figures [and] [t]o \nhold otherwise would be to import li mitations onto the claim from the specification, which is \nfraught with \u2018danger.\u2019\u201d) (citations omitted).  T he '284 patent  surely does not reflect any such \nintent on the part of the patentee.  Indeed, a s School Specialty acknowledges, t he specification \ndoes not even reference a \u201cstrut,\u201d nor is the strut structure at issue here separately numbered or \notherwise identified  in the patent .  (See D.I. 65 at 26, 32)  On the other hand, t he specification \nunderscores that the single embodiment de picted in the pa tent is not limiting.  ( '284 patent, col. \n2:37- 42 (\u201cThis discussion should not be construed, however, as limiting the invention to those \nparticular embodiments.  Practitioners skilled in the art will recognize numerous other \nembodiments as well.\u201d) ; see also id., col. 5:1- 4)  Therefore , the mere fact that certain figures of \nthe patent depict a strut does not warrant limiting the claims to require the strut  as a necessary 9 \n component of the claimed side supports .  See, e.g. , DuraSys. Barriers Inc. v. Van- Packer Co. , \nConsolidated Case No. 1:19- cv-01388- SLD -JEH, 2021 WL 4037826, at *22  (C.D. Ill. Sept. 3, \n2021).   \n Second, School Specialty contends that Virco had to add the side support struts in order \nto obtain the '284 patent \u2014and that the side support limitations must therefore be construed to \nrequire the strut structure .  (D.I. 65 at 24- 25, 32 )  Yet the prosecution histor y simply does not \nbear this out.  T he original claims were rejected by the E xaminer as being unpatentable over \nthree prior art references ( referred to as \u201c Bosman, \u201d \u201cEdelson\u201d  and \u201c Gillern \u201d).  (See, e.g., D.I. 69, \nex. 11 at 2 -3; id., ex. 13 at 2- 3)  The patentee ultimately amended its claims to add limitations \nincluding:  (1) the \u201cforward flexing support carriage [;]\u201d (2) the left and ri ght side supports ; and \n(3) a clarification that the seating surface of the chair is \u201ccantilevered by the left side support and \nthe right side support of the support carriage\u201d with the support carriage \u201cproviding forward flexure of the rocking chair and allowing the seating surface to tip forwardly.\u201d  ( Id., ex. 15 at 2-\n5)  One of the inventors, Robert J. Mills, also submitted a declaration (the \u201cMills Declaration\u201d) in which he touted the benefits of the claimed reverse cantilever ed design for a rocking chair \n(which chiefly flow from the ability of the chair\u2019s seat to tilt forward and downward\u2014 as \nopposed to a traditional cantilevered rocking chair , which tilts  backward and upward).  (Id. , ex. 8 \nat 6-11)  The Mills Declaration included some drawings depicting di fferences between a reverse \ncantilever ed design and a traditional cantilever ed design.  ( Id. at 29 -31)  Importantly, these \ndrawings did not depict a strut structure  like that circled above.  ( Id.; see also Tr. at 19)  \nUltimately, in allowing the amended claims, the Examiner stressed the importance of the \n\u201cforward flexure\u201d feature of the amended claims.  (D.I. 69, ex. 15 at 6; see also Tr. at 41- 42)  \nAnd yet n owhere in  the prosecution history is there a suggestion that the side supports absolutely 10 \n require  an \u201c[a]dditional tubular support strut\u201d  in order to promote forward flexure.  (D.I . 65 at \n11, 21, 28- 29; Tr. at 20- 21, 46; see also id. at 42 (Defendants\u2019 counsel conceding that the current \nrecord does not support the conclusion that a strut is required in order for the claimed chair to \npromote forward flexure, and suggesting t hat whether this was so might be  \u201ca matter of expert \ntestimony\u201d) )  Indeed, at the Markman hearing, School Spe cialty was forced to acknowledge that \nthe prosecution history did not \u201cexplicitly spell out\u201d that the additional strut is a requirement of \nthe claimed side supports.  (Tr. at 32- 33)2   \n In sum , School Specialty is seeking the  narrower, more limiting construction for \u201cside \nsupport .\u201d  But neither of its  primary  arguments are persuasive .  Thus , the Court cannot import \nSchool Specialty\u2019s suggested limitation into its construction.   \n As for Virco\u2019s proposed alternative construction, it is not very helpful.  As discussed \nabove, t he claims plainly tell us that the side supports are components/portions of the support \ncarriage, and that they extend downward from the side of the seating surface to the rearward \nportion of the rocker rails .  In light of this, the \u201c side support \u201d term would be easily understood by \njurors ; there is no need for the Court to add any further gloss .   \n \n 2  In the end, School Specialty\u2019s argument seemed to be motivated by its assertion \nthat the  claims of the '284 patent are directed to an invention that is very similar in appearance to \nthe invention claimed in the Bosman reference ( aside from the strut structure depicted in certain \nfigures of the '284 patent ).  (D.I. 65 at 32, 33 (\u201c[T]he inclusion of the separate support strut in the \nconstruction of this term is a critical limitation [] if the  ['284]  patent has any chance of surviving a \nvalidity challenge over prior art.\u201d); Tr. at 38- 39 (referencing Bosman) )  However, even assuming \nthat the Bosman reference really  is similar in appearance to the claimed  invention (and the Court \nis not so sure that it is),  (see Tr. at 23),  the i ntrinsic  record simply does not make it clear that the \npatentee intended to narrow the meaning of \u201cside support\u201d by requiring that it include a separate \nstrut structure .  The look of the Bosman reference is simply  not a reason to import the strut \nlimitation into the claims .  See, e.g. , Audionics Sys., Inc. v. AAMP of Fl., Inc., No. CV 12- 10763 \nMMM (JEMx), 2013 WL 9602634, at *25 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2013).   11 \n Having resolved the parties\u2019 dispute with respect to this term, and being unpersuaded that \neither of the parties\u2019 proposed constructions are helpful at this stage, for now the Court \nrecommends that \u201cside support\u201d simply be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning.   \nB. \u201cresilient layer\u201d  \n The next disputed term, \u201cresilient layer\u201d ap pears, inter alia , in claims 1 , 2, 3, 10 and 12 \nof the '180 patent .  Exemplary claim 1 recites:   \n1.  A chair comprising:  \na seat component comprising a seat portion with a bottom surface and a back support portion, the seat portion and the back support portion comprising a uniform body;  a bottom support component formed having a monolithic platform structure, the monolithic platform structure comprising:  \na rigid layer, the rigid layer comprising a rocking section, a flat section, and a transitional section, the rocking section having a defined curvature and extending between a front end of the bottom support component and the transitional section, the flat section having a substantially flat portion extending between a back end of the bottom support component and the transitional section; and  a resilient layer  covering at least a portion of the rigid layer, the \nresilient lay er formed from a compressible material; and  \nan intermediate support component joined to the seat component and comprising at least one support member, the at least one support member configured to interconnect the intermediate support with the seat component and the bottom support;  wherein the chair is configured to be selectively movable between a rocking position and a stop position, in the rocking position the \nchair is movable along the defined curvature of the rocking \nsection, in the stop position the chair is configured to limit \nmovement of the chair to the stop position, wherein the chair transitions between the rocking position and stop position by rotating past the transitional section of the bottom support. \n \n('180 patent, cols. 12:39- 13:2 (emphasis added))   The parties\u2019 competing proposed constructions \nfor \u201cresilient layer \u201d are set out in the chart below:   \n \n 12 \n Term   Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed \nConstruction  Defendants\u2019 Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201cresilient layer\u201d  \n  Plain and ordinary meaning ; \nno claim construction \nnecessary.   \n \nIn the alternative, the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cresilient layer\u201d could be \narticulated as \u201ca layer capable of substantially recovering original shape after \ndeformation\u201d   \u201cnon-rigid layer that springs \nback\u201d  \n (D.I. 65 at 34)  It is undisputed that the \u201csprings back\u201d portion of School Special ty\u2019s proposal  \nwould require that the material return to its original shape fairly quickly.  ( Id. at 35, 40; Tr. at 49, \n57, 59- 60; see also D.I. 66 at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6 32)   And this is the parties\u2019 primary \ndisput e:  whether the term requires a layer that \u201csprings back\u201d quickly  (as School Specialty \nargues ), or whether adopting such a construction would improperly import a limitation into the \nclaim s (as Virco asserts ).  (D.I. 65 at 39 -40; Tr. at 51, 56)\n3   \n \n 3  In its opening brief, Virco additionally contested the \u201cnon -rigid\u201d portion of \nSchool Specialty\u2019s proposal .  On that front , Virco assert ed that the ordinary meaning of \n\u201cresilient\u201d does not require the layer to be \u201cnon -rigid\u201d and argued that nothing in the intrinsic \nrecord indicates an intent to limit the scope of \u201cresilient\u201d in this manner.   (D.I. 65 at 35- 36)  In \nsupport of this portion of its construction, School Specialty asserts that the specification describes the resilient layer in contrast to the rigid layer, by noting that \u201c [t]he resilient layer 142 \ncan be  formed from a non- rigid com pressible material , such as an open or closed cell foam \nmaterial, neoprene, or other types of compressible materials.\u201d  ( Id. at 36 -37 (quoting '180 patent, \ncol. 6:55- 58) (emphasis added) )  While Virco did not respond to this particular \u201cnon- rigid\u201d \ndispute in  the reply portion of its brief, ( see D.I. 65 at 38- 40), during the Markman hearing, \nVirco\u2019s counsel reiterated Virco\u2019s  view that the specification does not dictate that the resilient \nlayer has  to be non- rigid \u2014instead  it only allows t hat it can  be, (Tr. at 51- 52 (providing examples \nof how materials can be rigid, but also \u201cresilient\u201d); see also id. at  64-65).   \n  The Court agrees with Virco here.   School Specialty does not point to anything that \nrequires  the resilient layer to be non- rigid (or t hat suggests that the ordinary meaning of resilient \nis something that is non- rigid).  Indeed, the specification later explains that \u201c[c]onditional \nlanguage  used herein, such as . . . \u2018can[]\u2019. . . is generally intended to convey that certain \nembodiments include, while other embodiments do not include, certain features, elements and/or 13 \n For the reasons discussed below, t he Court again agrees with Virco .  The evidence cited \nby School Specialty in support of its \u201csprings back\u201d position is simply not persuasive.   \nSchool Specialty starts by pointing to the intrinsic record \u2014it argues that the specification \ndictates that the resilient layer must spring back, in th e sense that the specification \u201cprovides no \ndisclosure of any material that does not spring back, or [that] does so slowly.\u201d  (D.I. 6 5 at 40)  \nBut the reality is that the concept of \u201cspringing back\u201d is simply not explicitly referenced in the \nspecification one way or the other .  (Nor is it so referenced in the prosecution history.) .  (Id. at \n35-36)  And  School Specialty certainly does not point to any portion of the specification that \ndisparages  slightly -less-than-\u201cspringy\u201d material, either.     \nIf anything, the specification affirmatively  helps Virco\u2019s case here.  ( Id. at 38 -39; Tr. at \n50, 52- 53)  To that end, t he specification identifies a gel- filled bladder as one type of material \nthat could form the resilient layer.  ( '180 patent, col. 7:7- 10)  Virco\u2019s expert, Dr. Richard W. \nKlopp, in turn opined that a POSITA would \u201creadily understand that a gel -filled bladder would \nexhibit viscous deformation behavior that is not appropriately described as \u2018springy.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 66 \nat Klopp Declaration at \u00b6 23)4  So when it c omes to the intrinsic record, Virco ha s the better \nargument.  \n \nstates.  Thus, such conditional language is not generally intended to imply that features, \nelements , and/or states are in any way required for one or more embodiments or that one or more \nembodiments necessarily include these features, elements, an d/or states .\u201d  ('180 patent, cols. \n9:66- 10:9); s ee, e.g. , Absolute Software, Inc. v. Stealth Signal, Inc., 659 F.3d 1121, 1137 (Fed. \nCir. 2011) (describing a portion of the specification that set out \u201c[s]ome of the features that can  \nbe included in the present invention \u201d as referencing features that are \u201c optional \u201d) (emphasis in \noriginal).    \n4  Dr. Klopp also points out that  the specification teaches  that the resilient layer \ncould be formed from \u201can open or closed cell foam material[ .]\u201d  (D.I. 66 at Klopp Declaration at \n\u00b6 24 (quoting '180 patent, col. 6:55- 57))  From there, Dr. Klopp opines that memory foam is such \na material, and that a POSITA  would not view memory foam as a material th at \u201csprings back \u201d \n(even though its shape does ultimately recover after indentation) , citing in support  to an article 14 \n  The remainder of School Specialty\u2019s support for its \u201csprings back\u201d p roposal consists of \nextrinsic evidence .  (D.I. 65 at 37; Tr. at 61)  N one of that evidence is convincing either .   \nFor example, School Specialty\u2019s expert Dr. Tim A. Osswald opined that \u201cthe concept of \nspringing back would be included in the understanding a  [POSITA]  would have of the term \n\u2018resilient.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 66 at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6 32)  Yet  this statement was  entirely conclusory:   \nDr. Osswald does not explain why it is so, and he cites to nothing in support of his position.  ( See \nid. at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6 24)  School Specialty next points  to Tech -ni-Fold Ltd. v. F.P. \nRosback Co., No. 14 C 5737, 2015 WL 5730105 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 29, 2015) \u2014a case in which a  \ncourt stated that \u201c\u2018 [r]esilient\u2019  is a commonly used word that the dictionary defines as able to \nrecoil  or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed.\u201d  (D.I. 65 at 37 \n(quoting Tech -ni-Fold Ltd., 2015 WL 5730105, at *6)  (emphasis omitted) )  Yet in that case, th e \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ended up s imply construing \n\u201cresilient\u201d to mean \u201c\u2018capable of recovering original shape after deformation[,]\u2019 \u201d without  \nincluding any time limitation for how quickly the material at issue must recover.  Tech -ni-Fold , \n2015 WL 5730105, at *6.  And f inally, School Specialty highlights certain dictionary definitions \nfor \u201cresilient\u201d that reference the concept of springing back.  ( D.I. 65 at 37 (citing D.I. 66, ex. H))   \n \nabout memory foam .  (Id. at \u00b6 2 5; see also D.I. 65 at 39; Tr. at 53)   In response, S chool Specialty \nargue s that the patent does not identify memory foam as a suitable material within the scope of \nthe claims , since \u201c[m]emory foam is particularly slow to spring back and thus would be an \nillogical design choice for the bottom of a chair[ .]\u201d  (D.I. 65 at 40)  But School Specialty cites to \nnothing in support of this  \u201cillogical design choice\u201d argument.   \n \n School Specialty also complains that the citation to the above -referenced article in Dr. \nKlopp\u2019s declaration is to a n inaccessible site, or i s otherwise incorrect .  (Id. at 40 n.3 (citing D.I. \n66 at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6 25))  However, the Court easily accessed the cited webpage.  It  \ncontains a 2005 article  describing memory foam a s an \u201copen -cell, polymeric\u201d  foam material that \n\u201cmatches any pressure against it and slowly returns to its original form once the pressure is removed.\u201d  Forty -Year -Old Foam Springs Back With New Benefits , NASA Spinoff, \nhttps://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2005/ ch_6.html  (last visited Apri l 20, 2022).   15 \n Tellingly, however, these dictionary definitions do not exclusively define \u201cresilient\u201d to mean only \n\u201cspringing back\u201d or  to otherwise requir e a time limitation.  ( Id. at 39 ; Tr. at 53- 54)  For instance, \nthe very first dictionary definition defines resilient as, inter alia , \u201c[1] springing back; \nrebounding.  [2] returning to the original form or position after being bent, compressed, or \nstretched. \u201d  (D.I. 66, ex.

(Tr. at 61- 62) \n Having determined that School Specialty\u2019s proposed construction is not on point ,5 the \nCourt now turns to whether Virco\u2019s proposed alternative construction (i.e., \u201c a layer capable of \nsubstantially recovering original shape after deformation\u201d) should be adopted.  Virco crafted this construction from other opinions where judges c onstru ed \u201cresilient, \u201d including the Tech -ni-Fold \nCourt \u2019s decision ( discussed above ) and another case where the court construed the term  to mean \n\u201csubstantially returns to the original shape.\u201d  (D.I. 65 at 35 (quoting Nike, Inc. v. Adidas Am. \nInc., Civil Action No. 9:06- CV-43, 2006 WL 3751181, at *9 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 18, 2006)) ; Tr. at \n54-55)  Sc hool Specialty countered that this proposal was off base, in part because it includes the \nword \u201csubstantially .\u201d  In School Specialty\u2019s view, the material must \u201cget pretty close to full \nrecovery, if not full recovery[,]\u201d  (Tr. at 58 -59), and \u201csubstantially\u201d does not connote that type of \nrecovery.   \n \n5  The Court  further notes that  near the end of the discussion on this term at the \nMarkman hearing, even School Specialty \u2019s counsel seemed to back off the suggestion that a \nresilient layer must \u201cspring\u201d back .  Instead, counsel suggested that the layer simply must \u201ccome \nback.\u201d  (Tr. at 6 2)  16 \n The Court is hesitant to adopt a construction for a term where the proposal is drawn \nentirely from claim constructions in other  cases  involving other  patents  (as opposed to a \nconstruction that is drawn primarily from the intrinsic evidence relating to the patents -in-suit in \nthis case ).  (See id. at 5 4-55)  Although Virco\u2019s proposal might not be wrong, for now, the Court \nwill err on the side of caution.  Having resolved the p arties\u2019 key dispute with respect to this term, \nthe Court r ecommends that \u201cresilient layer\u201d simply be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning.   \nC. \u201ccompressible material\u201d    \nThe term \u201ccompressible material\u201d is found in independent claims 1 and 10 of the '180 \npatent .  This term is related to the term \u201cresilient layer,\u201d as claim 1 requires \u201ca resilient l ayer \ncovering at least a portion of the rigid layer, the resilient layer formed from a compressible \nmaterial\u201d and claim 10 requires a \u201cresilient layer formed from a compressible material[.]\u201d  ( '180 \npatent, cols. 12: 54-56, 14:3- 4)  The parties\u2019 competing proposed constructions for \u201ccompressible \nmaterial\u201d are set out in the chart below:   \nTerm   Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed \nConstruction  Defendants\u2019 Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201ccompressible material\u201d  \n  Plain and ordinary meaning ; \nno claim construction  \nnecessary.   \n \nIn the alternative, the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201ccompressible material\u201d could be articulated as \u201cmaterial that can change \nshape as force is applied\u201d    Indefinite under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n112.  \n \u201csoft material that dampens the force applied to an object under the chair during use by the intended user\u201d  \n (D.I. 65 at 41)  As School Specialty contends that this term is indefinite, the Court will first set \nout the law as to definiteness .  It will then discuss the merits.   \n Section 112 of the Patent Act requires that a patent claim \u201cparticularly point[ ] out and \ndistinctly claim[ ] the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the 17 \n invention.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(b).  If it does not, the claim is indefinite and therefore \ninvalid.  Nautilus, Inc.  v. Biosig  Instruments, Inc. , 572 U.S. 898, 902 (2014).  The primary \npurpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that patent claims are written in such a way \nthat they give notice to the public of what is claimed, thus enabling interested members of the \npublic (e.g., competitors of the patent owner) to determine whether they infringe.  All  Dental  \nProdx, LLC  v. Advantage  Dental  Prods., Inc. , 309 F.3d 774, 779- 80 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  Even so, \n\u201cabsolute precision is unattainable\u201d and is not required.   Nautilus , 572 U.S. at 910.  In the end, \u201ca \npatent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification delineating the \npatent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the \nart about the scope of the invention.\u201d   Id. at 901.  As long as claims satisfy th e test for \ndefiniteness, \u201c relative terms and words of degree do not render patent claims invalid.\u201d  One -E-\nWay, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n , 859 F.3d 1059, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Definiteness  is to be \nevaluated from the perspective of a POSITA  at the time the patent was filed.   Nautilus , 572 \nU.S. at 908.6 \n School Specialty asserts that the '180 patent claims are invalid because the term \n\u201ccompressible material\u201d is indefinite .  It argues that this is so because:  (1) \u201c every material is \ncompressible if enough force is applied \u201d\u2014even a substance like metal \u2014and thus the term at \nissue \u201c includes everything and fails to provide objective boundaries to those of skill in the art[;]\u201d \nand (2) there are multiple ways to evaluate compressibility but the '180 patent fails to discuss \n \n 6  Like claim  construction, definiteness is a question of law for the court.  H-W \nTech.,  L.C. v.  Overstock.com,  Inc., 758 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed.  Cir. 2014) .  The United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that \u201c[a]ny fact critical to a h olding on \nindefiniteness  . . . must be proven by the challenger by clear  and convincing evidence.\u201d  Intel \nCorp. v.  VIA Techs.,  Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed.  Cir. 2003) ; see also Tech.  Licensing  Corp. \nv. Videotek,  Inc., 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 (Fed.  Cir. 2008) . 18 \n them .  (D.I. 65 at 44- 45; see also Tr. a t 79-81)  The Court will address  those two arguments in \norder.  \n School Specialty\u2019s first argument  overlooks  how \u201ccompressible material\u201d is used in \ncontext in the patent , and wrongly assesses the term in a vacuum.  (D.I. 65 at 50; Tr. at 67)  From \nthe claim language, we know that it is the \u201cresilient layer\u201d  of the bottom support component of \nthe claimed chair that is formed from a \u201ccompressible material.\u201d  ( '180 patent, col s. 12:39-56, \n13:24- 4:4)  And the specification helpfully provides examples of compressible material s that the \nresilient layer c an be formed from, \u201c such as an open or closed cell foam material, neoprene . . . \nor other types of compressible materials. . . . [including a] bladder[] that can be filled with a gas \n(such as, for example, air, nitrogen, and so forth) or fluid (such as, water, a gel substance, and the \nlike).\u201d  ( Id., cols. 6:55- 7:10)  The specification also notes that a compressible fo am (or other \ncompressible materials that could be used in the same or si milar fashion) for the resilient layer \nprovides \u201csufficient support and the desired movement while helping to reduce the amount of force applied to objects positioned under the chair during usage when compared to the use of at least some of the alternative  structures that can be used.\u201d  ( Id., col. 6:60- 66)   \nIn light of these disclosures, Virco\u2019s expert Dr.  Klopp persuasively opines that the \npatent\u2019s t eachings would have informed the POSITA  as to \u201ca range of properties\u201d of a \ncompressible material \u2014including that very hard materials such as metals would not fall within \nthe scope of the claim term.  (D.I. 66 at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6  32)  Indeed, even School \nSpecialty\u2019s expert Dr. Osswald acknowledge d that :  (1) the examples referenced in the \nspecification \u201cwould teach a [POSITA] something about the desired amount of hardness of the '180 patent claims [;]\u201d (2) it would not \u201cmake much sense\u201d for materials such as metal to form the \nresilient layer; and (3)  the specificati on \u201cidentifies the reasons for using a compressible 19 \n material [.]\u201d  (Id. at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39-40; see also id. at  \u00b6 42; Tr. at 69)7  The se \nexperts\u2019 statements underscore that the patent provide s real  guidance as to what m aterials do and \ndo not qualify as \u201c compressible. \u201d   \nSchool Specialty \u2019s second argument is that the claims are indefinite because there are \nmany ways to evaluate the compressibility of a material (such as taking a Shore A hardness \nmeasurement) , but the patent does not discuss any of the m.  (D.I. 65 at 45, 58 (\u201cWhen a \n[POSITA]  cannot consistently measure the scope of a claim, it is indefinite.\u201d); Tr. at 81- 82)  The \nCourt is not convinced that this renders the claims indefinite.  After all, the se claims do not \nrequire absolute numerical precis ion; they do not mandate that t he compressibility of the material \nmust  be above or below a particular numerical figure , nor even that it fall within a specific range \nof values .  And so the fact that there m ight be different ways that one can m easure a material \u2019s \ncompressibility  does not necessarily mean that the term at issue  is indefinite.   (Tr. at 99); see \nalso, e.g., Finalrod IP, LLC v. Endurance Lift Sols., Inc., Case No. 2:20- cv-00189- JRG-RSP, \n2021 WL 2187980, at *1 2-13 (E.D. Tex. May 28, 2021) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that \na limitation directed to \u201ccompressive force\u201d was indefinite because it failed to teach any particular method for measuring and comparing such force, because the claim \u201cdoes not require \n \n 7  The real problem in School Specialty\u2019s view seems to be that Dr. Klopp \u201cdoesn\u2019t \nknow, or doesn\u2019 t have an opinion anyway, whether the actual material [used in the accused \nproducts, i.e., thermoplastic elastomer]  is inside or outside the scope of the claim.\u201d  (Tr. at 78; \nD.I. 65 at 56- 57)  That criticism misses the mark.  Dr. Klopp did not opine  one way or the other \nas to whether a thermoplastic elastomer is within the scope of the claims , nor would he be \nexpected to.  Hi s declaration  was submitted at the claim construction stage of the case, and is not \nmean t to be an infringement opinion.

( See D.I. 65 at 54; Tr. at 77, 97)  Virco subsequently provided \nrevised language citing the current legal standard , which appears in the parties\u2019 joint claim \nconstruction brief that was submitted to the Court .  (D.I. 65 at 49, 54- 55)  School Specialty 21 \n That leaves the question :  What is the proper construction for \u201c compressible layer \u201d?  The \nCourt agrees with Virco that School Specialty\u2019s proposal improperly imports two extraneous \nlimitations into the claims :  that the material be \u201csoft\u201d and that it \u201cdampen[] the force applied to \nan object under the chair during use by the intended user.\u201d   (D.I. 65 at 41- 42)   \nIn support of its \u201csoft\u201d proposal , School Specialty points first to its e xpert\u2019s declaration.  \n(Id. at 45  (citing D.I. 66 at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 39- 43, 51- 52))  Dr. Osswald opines that the \ninventors specifically identified exemplary compressible types of foam \u201cbecause there are rigid \nfoams that are stiff and brittle . . .  which would not be considered compressible\u201d and that the \nPOSITA  \u201cwould at least understand that the inventors intended \u2018compressible layer\u2019 to mean a \nsoft material such as a soft open or closed cell foam, and not a hard and brittle foam.\u201d  (D .I. 66 at \nOsswald Declaration at \u00b6 42)   Furthermore, Dr. Osswald states  that the term \u201csoft\u201d in the context \nof the patent relates to a \u201c\u2018squeezable\u2019\u201d material (and not to the texture of a surface).  ( Id. at \u00b6 52; \nsee also id. at \u00b6 43 ; Tr. at 86)9   \n \nargues that Virco\u2019s original brief demonstrates that Virco and its expert are currentl y using the \nwrong legal standard with respect to this dispute.  ( Id. at 56)   \n \n The fact that Virco\u2019s original brief used the wrong  legal  standard wa s not great .  But \neverybody makes mistakes, and Virco corrected its mistake here .  Moreover, School Specialty \ndoes not point to any particular portion of Dr. Klopp\u2019s declaration that demonstrates that he in fact is applying the wrong legal s tandard.  ( Id. at 55 -56; T r. at 78- 79)  And as the Court has \nexplained, School Specialty has simply not met its bu rden to show that \u2014under the appropriate \nNautilus  standard \u2014the claims fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, a  POSITA  regarding the \nscope of \u201ccompressible material.\u201d    \n  \n9  Dr. Osswald explains in his declaration that a POSITA  would be familiar with \nmeasuring the hardness/softness of materials with a digital Shore A dur ometer , and notes that \nsuch measurements can range from \u201cextra soft\u201d to \u201cextra hard\u201d on the Shore A  hardness scale.  \n(D.I. 66 at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6 43)  He measured certain of the accused products and one of \nVirco\u2019s products ; he then  summarized the Shore A hardness of the materials on the bottom layer \nof these products.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 45 -50) 22 \n School Specialty also points to the intrinsic record.  For example, it  notes a line in the \nspecification  that describes the \u201cresilient layer \u201d (which is made from compressible material)  as \n\u201csofter\u201d than the \u201c coating layer \u201d (a layer that  may cover at least a portion of the resilient layer \nand \u201ccan help protect the resilient layer [] from damage\u201d ).  ('180 patent, col. 7:27- 34 (cited in  Tr. \nat 89))   School Specialty additionally asserts that the prosecution history dictates that the term \n\u201ccompressible material\u201d cannot cover \u201chard\u201d materials.  (D.I. 65 at 47 -48)  To that end, \naccording to School Specialty, the patentee added the limitation \u201cthe resil ient layer is formed \nfrom a compressible material\u201d  in order to overcome prior art that disclosed a rocking chair with a \nreturn mechanism (i.e., U .S. Patent No. 1,317,518, hereinafter \u201cKanode\u201d).  ( Id. at 8-9, 47- 48; \nD.I. 69, ex. 3 at 10; D.I. 69, ex. 4 at 3)   School  Specialty\u2019s expert  completes th is argument by \nopining that the Kanode patent  disclosed a plate with a coil spring on the bottom of the rocker  \nthat would have been made up of only \u201c hard\u201d materials \u2014and so the patentee\u2019s amendment  must \nhave served to limit the scope of the claimed \u201ccompressible material\u201d to \u201csoft\u201d material.   (D.I. 65 \nat 47 -48 (citing D.I. 66 at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6  41))  \nYet none of these arguments persuade the Court tha t the plain meaning of the term \n\u201ccompressible,\u201d in the context of the '180 patent , requires  that it be \u201csoft.\u201d  ( Id. at 43, 52; Tr. at \n74-75)  As an initial matter, Dr. Osswald\u2019s opinion is not grounded in the intrinsic record.  \nAdditionally, although th e specification does refer to the resilient layer  as being  \u201csofter\u201d than the \ncoating layer, it never once describe s the resilient layer  itself  as \u201csoft ,\u201d nor does it ever refer to \nthe Shore A hardness scale.  (D.I. 65 at 52; D.I. 66 at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 33- 36)  Lastly, \nwith respect to the prosecution history, as Virco points out, (D.I. 65 at 53), certain claims were \nrejected on the bas is that \u201cKanode teaches the concept of a bottom support component \ncomprising a resilient layer 12, 17 covering at least a portion of the rigid layer, the resilient layer 23 \n formed from a compressible material [,]\u201d ( D.I. 69, ex. 3 at 10 (emphasis added)).10  But  it appears \nthat the patentee overcame th is rejection by asserting that other  prior art references utilized by \nthe Examiner (i.e., \u201cGottfried,\u201d \u201cKjersem,\u201d \u201cSheehan\u201d and \u201cMorrow\u201d) did not teach the \nlimitations of the amended claims ; in allowing the claims, the Examiner did not mention Kanode , \nwhich the Examiner seemed to view as having a resilient layer made of a compressible material .  \n(Id., ex. 4 at 6 -7)  In the end, S chool Specialty points to nothing in the prosecution history \ncharact erizing any elements in the prior art or the invention claimed in the '180 patent as \u201chard\u201d \nor \u201csoft.\u201d  For all of these reasons, the Court is not convinced that the prosecution history \nrequires that a \u201csoft\u201d limitation be imported into the term \u201ccompressible material.\u201d11   \nThe Court next turns to School Specialty\u2019s proposal that \u201ccompressible material\u201d must be \nrequired to \u201cdampen[] the force applied to an object under the chair during use by the intended \nuser.\u201d   This language is derived from the specification\u2019s teaching that the use  of foam (or other \ncompressible materials) \u201ccan provi de a desired amount of compressibility, which can soften or \ndampen the force applied to an object positioned under the bottom support 106 during usage of \nthe chair.\u201d  ( '180 patent, cols. 6:66- 7:3; see also id., col. 6: 61-66 (explaining that foam can \n \n 10  Virco asserts that the language \u201clayer formed from a compressible material\u201d was \npresent in the original March 3, 2018 set of claims submitted to the United States Patent and \nTrademark Office  (\u201cPTO\u201d) , but only in dependent claims.  (D.I. 65 at 53)  It does not cite to \nanything in support  of this assertion, and it does not appear that the content of those dependent \nclaims are in the record before the Court.  From what the Court can tell, though, that language may have been in dependent claims 2 and 13.  ( See D.I. 69, ex. 3 at 9- 10 (PTO rejecting claims \n2-3 and 13 in view of Kanode et al. because Kanode teaches, inter alia , \u201cthe resilient layer \nformed from a compressible material\u201d) ; id., ex. 4 at 3- 4 (showing dependent claims 2 and 13 as \ncancelled  but not showi ng the language of those claims ))   \n  \n11  At one point in its briefing, School Specialty assert ed that it is undisputed that a \n\u201ccompressible material\u201d would be soft .  (D.I. 65 at 58)   But t hat issue is  disputed here.  During \nthe Markman hearing, V irco pointed to the example of a football as being made up of a material \nthat is compressible but not soft .  (Tr. at 74)  24 \n provide sufficient support and desired movement, while \u201chelping to reduce the amount of force \napplied to objects positioned under the chair dur ing usage\u201d); see also D.I. 65 at 47, 59)  So surely \na \u201ccompressible material\u201d can  dampen force in this way.  But t he Court is not persuaded that it \nshould construe the term to require  this result in all instances .  In the above -cited portion of the \nspecification, t he patent ee is describing a specific embodiment .  And again, the use of \u201ccan\u201d in \nthis p art of the specification signals that the patentee was not intending to limit the claims to th at \nembodiment.  (D.I. 65 at 51- 52)  As Virco points out, a very young child could be sitting on the \nchair and , in that case, the child might not weigh enough such that the chair \u2019s compressible \nmaterial  would actually serve to \u201cdampen[] the force applied to an object under the chair [.]\u201d  (Tr. \nat 73- 74)   \nThe Court now t urns finally to Virco\u2019s proposed alternative construction (i.e., \u201cmaterial \nthat can change shape as force is applied\u201d) .  School Specialty contends that this  language is too \nbroad because it would include \u201cevery material\u201d since \u201cevery material can change shape if \nenough force is applied.\u201d  (D.I. 65 at 59)  That seems to be a reasonable critique .  Thus, the \nCourt will not recommend that Virco\u2019s proposed language be adopted .  (D.I. 66 at Osswald \nDeclaration at \u00b6 35; id. at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6 29)    \nThat said, a  construction for \u201ccompressible material\u201d does seem like it could be helpful to \nthe jury.  (D.I. 65 at 41, 59)  It seems undisputed that \u201ccompressible material\u201d must allow for \n\u201clocal indentation of an object into the layer [.]\u201d  ( D.I. 66 at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6 37; D.I. 65 at \n53, 59)   It is also undisputed that the patent provides examples of types of compressible materials \nthat could be used.  (D.I. 66 at Osswald Declaration at \u00b6 39; id. at Klopp Declaration at \u00b6\u00b6 31- 32)  \nThus, the Court recommends that the term \u201ccompressible material\u201d be construed to mean \n\u201cmaterial that allows for local indentation of an object into the material , such as  an open or 25 \n closed cell foam material, neoprene, a bladder filled with gas or fluid, or materials similar \nthereto.\u201d  ( See Tr. at 7 1-72)   \nD. \u201cstop position\u201d  \nThe final term \u201cstop position\u201d appears in claims 1 and 10 of the '180 patent.  The  \nspecification also refers to the stop position as a \u201cflat position\u201d or \u201cfloat position.\u201d  ( '180 patent, \ncol. 7:47- 48)  The patent explains that the bottom support of the chair \u201cis configured to provide \ncontrolled movement between a rocking position and a flat position[,]\u201d and that this bottom \nsupport in turn consists of a rocker portion, a transitional portion and a flat p ortion.  ( Id., cols. \n7:46- 51, 12: 43-56)  The flat portion is positioned in the rear of the bottom support  and can be \nsubstantially flat.  ( Id., col. 8:4- 6)   \nThe parties\u2019  competing proposed constructions for \u201c stop position\u201d are set out in the chart \nbelow:   \nTerm   Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed \nConstruction  Defendants\u2019 Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201cstop position\u201d  \n  Plain and ordinary meaning ; \nno claim construction  \nnecessary.   \n \nIn the alternative, the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cstop position \u201d could be \narticulated as \u201cposition configured to stabi lize the \nmovement of the chair\u201d     \u201ca resting position that can be \nmaintained without actively using one\u2019s legs\u201d  \n (D.I. 65 at 59)  The crux of the dispute between the parties appears to be whether the \u201cstop  \nposition\u201d  is one where the chair is resting on its flat portion in a manner such that \u201cit requires \nthat [a user] can maintain it without using [her] legs\u201d (as School Specialty suggests) , or whether \na \u201cstop position\u201d  is one where a user \u201cmight not be able to maintain it without actively using \n[her] legs \u201d (as Virco suggests).  (Tr. at 112 )  Here, the Court agrees with Virco.   26 \n  In support of its position, School Specialty points to a portion of the specification that \nexplains : \nA person can remain in the float position and rest on the flat \nportion 142 of the bottom portion with minimal effort. . . . \nAdditionally, the flat portion 142 functions to maintain the position \nof the person in place.  In some configurations, the chair can rest on the flat portion with a person sitting without the person holding the chair in position with his legs.  Preferably, when in the float position, the person actively rocks the chair forward in order to transition from the float position to the rocking position.  \n \n('180 patent, col. 8: 19-31 (cited in  D.I. 65 at 61) )  The specification clearly tells us that \u201c [i]n \nsome configurations ,\u201d the stop position will be a resting position that can be maintained without \nactive use of one\u2019s legs.  It does not say \u201cin all configurations.\u201d  (D.I. 65 at 62)  And the \nspecification makes clear that a person can remain in the float position and rest o n the flat \nportion \u201cwith minimal effort\u201d ; this would certainly seem to allow for the possibility that a \nclaimed embodiment could require a bit of effort from the user\u2019s legs  in order to maintain the \nstop position.  (Tr. at 102, 104)   In short, School Specialty points to nothing that would support \nlimiting \u201cstop position\u201d t o a position that can be maintained without actively using one\u2019s legs.  \nSee, e.g., Odyssey Wireless,  Inc. v. Apple  Inc., CASE N OS. 15-CV-1735- H (RBB), 2016 WL \n3055900, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2016)  (rejecting the defendant\u2019s limiting construction where \nthe specification uses permissive rather than mandatory language such as \u201c\u2018 in some \nembodiments \u2019\u201d) (citation omitted) .   \n That said, the Court agrees with School Specialty that a jury may benefit from some \nfurther explanation of what is a \u201c stop position.\u201d  (D.I. 65 at 63)  The specification explains that \n\u201c[t]he flat portion [] functions as a stop to stabilize movement and lim it further backward and \nforward rocking movement of the chair [] when in a float position[.]\u201d  ( '180 patent, col. 8:8- 11)  \nVirco\u2019s proposed construction reflects this teaching.  (D.I. 65 at 60)  Therefore, the Court 27 \n recommends that \u201cstop position\u201d be construed to mean \u201cposition configured to stabilize the \nmovement of the chair.\u201d     \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the District Court adopt the \nfollowing constructions:  \n1. \u201cside support\u201d should be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning \n2. \u201cresilient layer \u201d should be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning \n3. \u201ccompressible material\u201d should be construed to mean \u201c material that allows for \nlocal indentation of an object into the material, such as an open or closed cell foam material, \nneoprene, a bladder filled with gas or fluid, or materials similar thereto \u201d \n4. \u201c stop position\u201d should be construed to mean \u201c position configured to stabilize the \nmovement of the chair\u201d       \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
