{"case_name": "WSOU Investments, LLC v. Xilinx, Inc.", "case_number": "20-1228", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "11-04-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nWSOU INVESTMENTS, LLC D/B/A\nBRAZOS LICENSING AND\nDEVELOPMENT,\nPlaintiff,\nV.\nXILINX, INC.,\nDefendant.C.A. No. 20-1228-GBW-JLH\n(Consolidated)\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nIn this patent infringement action between Plaintiff WSOU Investments, LLC d/b/a Brazos\nLicensing and Development (\"WSOU\" or \"Plaintiff\") and Defendant Xilinx, Inc (\"Xilinx\" or\n\"Defendant\"), Magistrate Judge Hall held a Markman hearing and issued a Report and\nRecommendation (D.l. 146, the \"Report\") recommending that the Court adopt constructions for\nnine disputed claim terms in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,784,653 (the \"'653 patent\"), 7,068,950 (the \"'950\npatent\"), 7,613,938 (the \"'938 patent\"), and 7,903,971 (the \"'971 patent\").^ Both WSOU and\nXilinx filed objections. WSOU objected to four constructions, and Xilinx disputes one\nconstruction. D.l. 149 & 150. WSOU and Xilinx responded to each other's objections. D.l. 153\n& 155.\nThe Court has reviewed the Magistrate Judge's Report, the objections and the responses\nthereto, and has considered de novo the original claim construction briefing and supporting\ndocuments, as well as the transcript of the claim construction hearing. See, e.g., St. Clair\nIntellectual Prop. Consultants, Inc. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 691 F. Supp. 2d 538, 541-42\n' Docket citations refer to C.A. No. 20-1228, unless otherwise noted.(D. Del. 2010); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1); FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b)(3). For the reasons set forth below,\nWSOU and Xilinx's objections to the Report are OVERRULED and the reconunended\nconstructions are ADOPTED.\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to\nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWHCorp., 415 F.3d 1303,1312\n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v.\nSumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251,1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides\nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from\nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention\"). \"[Tjhere is no magic formula or catechism for\nconducting claim construction.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the\nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent\nlaw.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question of law, although\nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370,372 (1996)).\n\"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as\nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and\nprosecution history.\" Thorner v. iSony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir.\n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to\nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular clahn in which the disputed term\nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at\n1313.\"When construing claini terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic\nevidence, including the claims themselves, the specification, and the prosecution history of the\npatent, which is usually dispositive.\" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. TevaPharms. USA, Inc., 73 \\ F.3d\n1271,1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and xmasserted,\ncan... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are\nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can\noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In\naddition, \"[djifferences among claims can also be a useftil guide[.]\" Id. For example, \"the\npresence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the\nlimitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-15.\nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which \"is always highly\nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a\ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576,1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is\nalso possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the\npatentee that differs firom the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's\nlexicography govems.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only\na single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the\npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of\nmanifest exclusion or restriction.\" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372\n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Liehel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc.,\n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be\nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language.\" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d\n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004).The Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence.\"\nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim\nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor\nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.]\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317.\nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to\nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the\nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Tbva, 135 S. Ct. at 841.\nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence extemal to the patent and prosecution history,\nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\" Markman, 52 F.3d\nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic\nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted),\nn. DISCUSSION\na. \"directly connected\"\nThe Report recommended construing \"directly connected\" to mean \"coimected only by\nconductors like wires or metal traces.\" D.I. 146 at 2, 6-8. WSOU maiutains that the cormection\n\"may include nonEXOR components that do not materially change the decision circuit's output.\"\nD.I. 150 at 3. But WSOU's construction encompasses any number of iutermediate components\n(so long as there is not an EXOR circuit)\u2014a. construction contrary to the specification and claim\nlanguage. See '653 patent at Fig. 3; 2:57-64; 4 cl. 1,7; D.I. 135-1 ^ 56. As the Report recognized,\n\"[t]he problem for WSOU is that, ultimately, the scope of the invention is described by the claims;\nthe patentee is not entitled to everything not in the prior art. The patent could have claimed any\ncircuit without an EXOR. The patent could have said in the specification that certain other\ncomponents could be part of a 'direct cormection.' It did neither.\" D.I. 146 at 8. Accordingly, the\n4Court, having reviewed the record de novo, agrees with the Report's conclusions. WSOU's\nobjection to the construction of \"directly connected\" is overruled.\nb. \"an analyzer configured (!) to analyze spectral power of an input signal\ncorresponding to the carrier and data signals, the spectral power being in a\nspectral band corresponding to a spectral null of the input signal, and (ii) to\ngenerate a control signal based on the analysis\"\nThe Report recommended construing the term \"analyzer\" as a means-plus-function term,\nthe function of which is \"(i) to analyze spectral power of an input signal corresponding to the\ncarrier and data signals, the spectral power being in a spectral band corresponding to a spectral\nnull of the uiput signal, and (ii) to generate a control signal based on the analysis.\" D.I. 146 at 2,\n11. The Report identified the corresponding structure as, \"A spectrum analyzer and [an algorithm\ndisclosed in the specification that can perform the claimed second function].\" Id.\nAccording to WSOU, the Report erred analytically by presuming \"analyzer\" to be a means-\nplus-function term, placing the burden upon WSOU to demonstrate otherwise. D.I. 150 at 6-7. But\nthe Report set forth the correct legal analysis: \"claims without the word 'means' are presumed not\nto be means-plus-function\" and \"that presumption is rebutted if a claim does not recite sufficient\nstructure for performing a claimed function.\" D.I. 146 at 10 (citing Williamson v. Citrix Online,\nLLC, 792 F.3d 1339, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Report then\ncorrectly found that Xilinx rebutted the presumption because \"[t]he claim recites no structure ...\nbesides the generic term 'analyzer'\" to perform the function of \"to analyze the power spectrum in\na spectral band around a spectral null and generate a control signal based on the analysis.\" Id. at\n10-11.\nWSOU next argues that the Report erred by requiring \"analyzer ...\" to meet too high a\nstandard to avoid means-plus-function treatment\" because \"analyzer\" is \"a sufficiently definite\nstructural term for a variety of structures with a reasonably well understood meaning in the art.\"D.L 150 at 7 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). But this Court agrees with the\nReport's analysis that \"the fact that one of skill in the art could program a computer to perform the\nrecited fianctionQ cannot create structure where none otherwise is disclosed,\" D.I. 146 at 11, as\nwell as its conclusion that \"the claim does not recite to one of skill in the art sufficient structure to\nperform the claimed second function,\" id., which is \"to generate a control signal based on the\nanalysis.\"\nFinally, WSOU contends that the Report erred by concluding tihat the specification must\ndisclose an algorithm. According to WSOU, no algorithm is required. D.I. 150 at 9. But\n\"[w]hether it's the processor in the spechum analyzer that generates the control signal or it's a\nspecialized processor, the case law has consistently held that when a mean-plus-function claim\nrequires a computer to perform a specific function, the claim is limited to algorithms disclosed to\naccomplish that [and their equivalents]. Generating a control signal firom the power in a spectral\nnull is a specific fimction, so the corresponding structure must include an algorithm.\" D.I. 146 at\n12 {citing Noah Sys., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., 675 F.3d 1302,1312 (Fed. Cir. 2012)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). While WSOU seeks to avoid indefiniteness by arguing that, to the extent an\nalgorithm is required, it is disclosed in the specification, D.I. 150 at 9, the Court agrees with the\nReport's recommendation to defer indefiniteness to summary judgment, D.1.146 at 12-13.\nAccordingly, the Court, having reviewed the record de novo, agrees with the Report's\nconclusions that analyzer should be construed as a means-plus-function term and that the\ncorresponding structure must include at least a spectrum analyzer and an algorithm disclosed in\nthe specification that can perform the claimed second function. The parties may address at\nsummary judgment whether the specification discloses an algorithm sufficient to avoid a finding\nof indefiniteness. WSOU's objections are overruled.c. ''operable independent of the controller\"\nThe Report recommended construing \"operable independent of the controller\" to mean\n\"able to operate while the controller is powered down.\" D.I. 146 at 17. XiUnx argues that the\nReport's construction, which was not advanced by any partyis contrary to the intrinsic evidence\nand makes the term redimdant and meaningless. D.I. 149. This Court disagrees.\nXilinx's proposed construction\u2014^\"[ojperating separately from signals or commands of the\ncontroller\"\u2014improperly adds a limitation not supported by the claim language or specification.\nClaim 13 uses the word \"operable,\" not \"operating.\"^ The plain and ordinary meaning of\n\"operable\" means \"able to operate.\" As for the specification, when discussing a switch controller\n(i.e., an \"electrical power device\") that is \"operable independent of the controller,\" the\nspecification states:\nIn some embodiments, the switch controller is operable\nindependently of the controller for controlling the switch to restore\nthe electrical power to the device. In this arrangement, the switch\ncontroller enables electrical power to be restored to the device if the\nmodule becomes inoperative, for example, in the event that power\nis also removed from the controller.\n^ WSOU argued that no construction was necessary as \"operable independent of the\ncontroller\" could be understood by its plain and ordinary meaning. D.l. 135 at 42.\n^ Claim 13 of the '938 patent recites:\n13. A circuit card comprising:\none or more devices,\na controller for controlling operation of the circuit card,\na switch responsive to a command received from the\ncontroller, for causing electrical power to at least one\ndevice to be decoupled therefrom for a\npredetermined period of time, and\nan electrical power device, operable independent of the\ncontroller, that causes electrical power to the at least\none device and the controller to be restored after the\npredetermined time period if the electrical power was\nalso decoupled from the controller.'938 patent at 1:55-60. While Xilinx argues that \"being operable when the controller is not\npowered is only 'an example' of being 'operable independent of the controller'\" and thus does not\namount to the \"actual meaning or scope of this term,\" D.I. 149 at 6, the specification supports the\nnotion that the controller being powered down is a situation in which the claimed electrical power\ndevice must be able to operate to be \"independent of the controller.\" '938 patent at 1:55-60. As\na result, \"Claim 13 does not expressly require the 'electrical power device' to independently power\ndown any device\u2014^in claim 13 the 'controller' and the 'switch' power devices down then the\n'electrical power device' may re-power them after a predetermined period.\" D.l. 146 at 17.\nAlthough Xilinx argues that the Report's construction renders subsequent claim language\nsurplusage, D.l. 149 at 7, \"operable independent of the controller\" informs a person of ordinary\nskill in the art about the operability of the circuit card as claimed\u2014^that is, that the electrical power\nis still capable of operating even though the controller's power is decoupled.\nFioally, although Xilinx argues that the prosecution history resolves the meaning of\n\"operable independent of the controller\" in its favor and argues the Report erred by \"seemingly\nreqiiiring Xilinx to prove disclaimer\" (D.l. 149 at 8-9), the cited portions of the prosecution history\nare not dispositive of the inquiry; neither do they permit Xilinx to add a limitation \"not rooted in\neither the claim language or the specification.\" D.l. 146 at 17; see also Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415\nF.3d 1303, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (noting that the specification is \"the single best guide to the\nmeaning of a disputed term.\").\nAccordingly, the Court, having reviewed the record de novo, agrees with the Report's\nconclusions. Xilinx's objection to the construction of \"operable independent of the controller\" is\noverruled.d. 'Vherein the plurality of signal states and the number of bits in each\nsequence are increased\"\nThe Report recommended construing \"wherein the plurality of signal states and the number\nof bits in each sequence are increased\" to mean \"wherein an increase in the plurality of signal\nstates and the number of bits in each sequence is performed automatically.\" D.I. 146 at 2, 19.\nWSOU objects to importation of a \"performed automatically\" limitation and corresponding\nexclusion of manual increases, D.I. 150 at 10. Considering de novo the evidence and arguments\nadvanced by the parties, and specifically noting that WSOU (1) offered no evidence to suggest a\nperson of skill in the art would understand the claims to cover manually setting the signaling mode,\nand (2) did not address Xillinx's evidence explaining why manual configuration is outside the\nclaim scope, the Court agrees with the Report's conclusions. D.I. 146 at 18-19. WSOU's objection\nto the construction of \"wherein the plurality of signal states and the number of bits in each sequence\nare increased\" is overruled.\ne. \"based on a transmission quality of the optical signal\"\nThe Report recommended construing \"based on a transmission quality of the optical\nsignal\" to mean \"based on analysis and evaluation of a characteristic of the optical signal.\" D.l.\n146 at 2,19-20. WSOU objects to the construction as purporting to limit \"how the transmission\nquality is obtained\" and argues that \"transmission quality might be determined/provided by a\nseparate device or third-party.\" D.I. 150 at 11. But WSOU did not brief this argument before the\nMagistrate Judge, D.I. 135 at 56-57, 58-59, and has not shown good cause for raising new\narguments in its objections that it did not present to the Magistrate Judge. See\nCoolTVNetwork.com, Inc. v. Blackboard Inc., C.A. No. 19-291-LPS-JLH, 2021 WL 2010579, at\n* 1 (D. Del. May 20,2021) (declining to consider new arguments raised in objections to report andrecommendation).'^ Nevertheless, considering de novo the evidence and arguments advanced by\nthe parties, the Court agrees with the Report's conclusions. D.I. 146 at 19-20. WSOU's objection\nto the construction of \"based on a transmission quality of the optical signal\" is overruled.\n\" Neither did WSOU submit the requisite certification pursuant to the Court's Standing\nOrder for Objections Filed Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 72 (Mar. 7,2022) (\"Any party filing objections\nwith a District Judge to a Magistrate Judge's order, ruling or recommended disposition must\ninclude, along with the objections, a written statement either certifying that the objections do not\nraise new legal/factual arguments, or identifies the new arguments and describes the good cause\nfor failing to previously raise the new legal/factual arguments before the Magistrate Judge.\").\n10* * *\nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED on November 2022 that:\n1. Plaintiff's Objections (D.I. 150) to the Report are OVERRULED;\n2. Defendant's Objections (D.I. 149) to the Report are OVERRULED;\n3. The Report is ADOPTED; and\n4. The parties shall submit for the Court's signature no later than November 9, 2022\na Claim Construction Order consistent vffth this Memorandum Order and the Magistrate Judge's\nclaim constructions to which the parties did not object.\nGREGORY B.
