{"case_name": "Ficep Corporation v. Peddinghaus Corporation", "case_number": "19-1994", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "02-28-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nFICEP CORPORATION, \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 19-1994-RGA \nPEDDINGHAUS CORPORATION , \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAdam W. Poff, Robert M. Vrana, YOUNG CONAWAY STARGATT & TAYLOR , LLP, \nWilmington, DE; Matthew B. Lowrie (argued), Kevin M. Littman, FOLEY & LARDNER LLP, \nBoston, MA, \nAttorneys for Plaintiff. \nKelly E. Farnan, RICHARDS , LAYTON & FINGER , P.A., Wilmington, DE; Stephanie P. Koh \n(argued), LeifE. Peterson, II, SIDLEY AUSTIN LLP, Chicago, IL, \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nFebruary 1\u00a3._, 2022 Before me is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ofUnpatentability Under 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 101. (D.I. 49). I have reviewed the parties' briefing (D.I. 50, 53, 58), and I heard oral \nargument on February 17, 2022. (References to the transcript of the oral argument are indicated \nby \"Tr.\"). For the reasons that follow, I will GRANT this motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn its First Amended Complaint (D.I. 13), Plaintiff Ficep Corporation alleges that \nDefendant Peddinghaus Corporation infringes one or more claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,974,719 \n(\"the '719 patent\"). Ficep and Peddinghaus are competitors in the production of steel \nfabrication machinery, which can be used to manufacture large steel beams for use in \nconstruction projects. (D.I. 13 at ,r,r 6, 9; '719 patent, 3:62--4:7). The '719 patent is entitled \n\"Method and an Apparatus for Automatic Manufacture of an Object with Multiple Intersecting \nComponents .\" It generally relates to \"systems and methods for automatic manufacture of an \nobject based on automatic transmission of a three-dimensional rendering of the object, such as a \nrendering from a CAD to an assembly line for manufacture.\" ('719 patent, 1 :9-13). \nPeddinghaus filed a motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint for lack of patent \neligible subject matter. (D.I. 15). The Magistrate Judge issued a Report & Recommendation \nrecommending that I deny the motion because there were factual disputes as to whether the \nclaims recited an inventive concept. (D.I. 30). I did not rule on the merits as to any objections \nto the Report & Recommendation, but I did adopt its conclusion that I deny the motion to \ndismiss. (D.I. 33 at 2). I suggested an early summary judgment motion on the patent eligibility \nissue would be appropriate. (Id.). Peddinghaus later filed the present motion for summary \njudgment of unpatentability. (D.I. 49). \n1 II. LEGAL STANDA RDS \nA. Summary Judgment \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" FED. \nR. Crv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. \nLamontv . New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177,181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242,248 (1986)). \"(A] dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence \nis sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. The \nburden on the moving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is \nan absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 \nU.S. 317,323 (1986). \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); \nWilliams v. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving \nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents , electronically stored \ninformation, affidavits or declarations , stipulations ... , admissions, interrogatory answers, or \nother materials ; or (B) showing that the materials cited (by the opposing party] do not establish \nthe absence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" FED. R. Crv. P. 56(c)(l). The non-moving party's \nevidence \"must amount to more than a scintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the \ncourt) than a preponderance. \" Williams, 891 F.2d at 461. \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable \n2 inferences in that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). If the \nnon-moving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with \nrespect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \noflaw. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \nB. Patent-Eligible Subject Matter \nSection 101 of the Patent Act defines patent-eligible subject matter. It provides: \n\"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture , or \ncomposition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, \nsubject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court \nrecognizes three categories of subject matter that are not eligible for patents-laws of nature, \nnatural phenomena , and abstract ideas. Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int'!, 573 U.S. 208, 216 \n(2014). The purpose of these exceptions is to protect the \"basic tools of scientific and \ntechnological work.\" Mayo Collaborativ e Servs. v. Prometheus Lab ys, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 71 \n(2012). \nIn Alice, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the framework laid out in Mayo \"for \ndistinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena , and abstract ideas from \nthose that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts.\" Alice, 573 U.S. at 217. First, \nthe court must determine whether the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible concept. Id. If the \nanswer is yes, the court must look to \"the elements of the claim both individually and as an \nordered combination \" to see if there is an \"inventive concept-i.e., an element or combination of \nelements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than \na patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\" Id. at 217-18 ( cleaned up). \n3 \"While the ultimate determination of eligibility under \u00a7 101 is a question of law, ... there \ncan be subsidiary fact questions which must be resolved en route to the ultimate legal \ndetermination.\" Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software , Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1128 \n(Fed. Cir. 2018). \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nA. Representative Claim \nA court may treat a claim as representative where all claims are \"substantially similar and \nlinked to the same abstract idea.\" Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo \nBank, Nat. Ass 'n, 776 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Peddinghaus argues that claim 7 is \nrepresentative of all claims of the '719 patent. (D.I. 50 at 3 & n.l). Ficep disagrees. (D.I. 53 \nat 25). \nClaims 1, 7, and 14 are the only independent claims in the '719 patent. These claims are \nwritten as method, apparatus, and article of manufacture claims, respectively, but recite \nsubstantially the same limitations, including: (1) creating a design model of an object having \nmultiple individual components defining an intersection at which the two components are in \ncontact with one another; (2) identifying and extracting component dimensions, intersection \nparameters, and manufacturing parameters from the design file; (3) transmitting that information \nto the manufacturing machine; and (4) manufacturing components, using the manufacturing \nmachine, based at least in part on the transmitted component dimensions, intersection \nparameters, and manufacturing parameters . (See '719 patent, claims 1, 7, and 14). Thus, I \nagree with Peddinghaus that claim 7 is representative of the independent claims of the '719 \npatent. \n4 Peddinghaus further argues that claim 7 is representative of the dependent claims because \nthey do not include limitations that would alter the\u00a7 101 analysis. (D.I. 50 at 3 n.1 & 16 n.6). \nSpecifically, Peddinghaus contends, \nClaims 8, 9, and 13 recite further generic computer components such as a \"data \nstorage unit,\" a \"monitor,\" and a \"wireless connection\" over which the transmitter \ncan send data. Claim 10 adds that an object is assembled from the manufactured \ncomponents, as it would be in any prior art manufacturing method. Claims 11 and \n12 merely describe generic aspects of the design model, all of which the \nspecification acknowledges are in the prior art. Claims 2-6 are directed to similar \nsubject matter, but in the context of method claim 1. \n(Id. at 16 n.6) (internal citations omitted). \nIn response, Ficep argues that the limitations in claims 4 and 10 (assembly of the object) \nand claim 13 (wireless connection) further tie the claims to \"the physical world and \nmanufacturing process.\" (D.I. 53 at 25). I agree with Peddinghaus that the limitations in the \ndependent claims do not alter the \u00a7 101 analysis. The dependent claims merely add generic \ncomponents and limitations that are conventional and uninventive . \nBecause all the independent claims recite the same concept and the dependent claims \noffer only minor, non-technical limitations, I will consider claim 7 as representative. See \nContent Extraction, 776 F.3d at 1348; Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2018) (\"[C]ourts may treat a claim as representative ... if the patentee does not present any \nmeaningful argument for the distinctive significance of any claim limitations not found in \nthe representative claim.\"). \nRepresentative claim 7 recites: \n7. An apparatus for automatic manufacture of an object, comprising: \na computing device adapted to create a design model of an object having multiple \nindividual components, at least two of the individual components defining an \nintersection at which the two components are in contact with one another; \n5 at least one programmable logic controller in communication with the computing \ndevice and with at least one manufacturing machine; \na receiver associated with the programmable logic controller for receiving the \ndesign model of the object; \na database unit adapted to store the design model received at the receiver; \na processor which is associated with the programmable logic controller and extracts \nfrom the design model a plurality of dimensions of components which define a \nplurality of components of the object; \nwherein the processor identifies a plurality of intersection parameters which define \nthe intersection of the two components; \nwherein the processor extracts from the design model the intersection parameters; \na transmitter associated with the processor for transmitting the intersection and \nmachining parameters and the component dimensions from the programmable logic \ncontroller to the at least one manufacturing machine; and \nwherein the at least one manufacturing machine manufactures the components \nbased at least in part on the transmitted component dimensions and on the \ntransmitted intersection and manufacturing parameters . \n('719 patent, 8:25-55). \nB. Alice Step One \nFirst, I must determine whether claim 7 as a whole is directed to an abstract idea. Alice, \n573 U.S. at 218. \"The 'abstract ideas' category embodies 'the longstanding rule that an idea of \nitself is not patentable .\"' Id. (quoting Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972)). \"The \nSupreme Court has not established a definitive rule to determine what constitutes an 'abstract \nidea' sufficient to satisfy the first step of the Mayo/Alice inquiry.\" Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft \nCorp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that \n\"fundamental economic practice[s],\" Bilski, 561 U.S. at 611, \"method[s] of organizing human \nactivity,\" Alice, 573 U.S. at 220, and mathematical algorithms, Benson, 409 U.S. at 64, are \n6 abstract ideas. In navigating the parameters of such categories, courts have generally sought to \n\"compare claims at issue to those claims already found to be directed to an abstract idea in \nprevious cases.\" Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1334. \nIn determining whether claims are directed to an abstract idea, the court should look to \nwhether the claims \"focus on a specific means or method that improves the relevant technology \nor are instead directed to a result or effect that itself is the abstract idea and merely invoke \ngeneric processes and machinery.\" McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d \n1299, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1336). The Federal Circuit further \ninstructs district courts to \"approach the Step 1 directed to inquiry by asking what the patent \nasserts to be the focus of the claimed advance over the prior art. In conducting that inquiry , we \nmust focus on the language of the asserted claims themselves, considered in light of the \nspecification.\" TecSec, Inc. v. Adobe Inc., 978 F.3d 1278, 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (cleaned up). \nPeddinghaus argues that representative claim 7 is directed to the abstract idea of \n\"identifying, extracting, and transferring data from a design file for the purpose of manufacturing \nan object.\" (D.I. 50 at 10). Peddinghaus asserts that the claims take a prior art process which \nhas been manually performed by humans and simply add \"generic computer components to \nreduce human error and increase efficiency .\" (Id. at 10). Ficep argues that the '719 patent is \nvalid under Step One because (1) the claims are directed to a real-world system as in Diehr; and \n(2) the claims are directed to a technological improvement. (D.I. 53 at 8-17). \nIn Diamond v. Diehr, the Supreme Court held that the claimed process for curing rubber, \nwhich included a step where a computer performed calculations using a well-known \nmathematical equation, was patent eligible. 450 U.S. 175, 184-87, 193 (1981). Ficep argues \nthat, much like the claims in Diehr, \"the claims in the '719 patent use computers that perform \n7 computations as part of a process for using a physical machine to manufacture physical \ncomponents.\" (D.I. 53 at 10). The claims in Diehr, however, \"describe[d] in detail a step-by\u00ad\nstep method\" for accomplishing an improved physical process. Diehr, 450 U.S. at 184; Thales \nVisionix Inc. v. United States, 850 F.3d 1343, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\"In terms of the modem day \nAlice test, the Diehr claims were directed to an improvement in the rubber curing process, not a \nmathematical formula.\"). 1 \nIn contrast, the '719 patent does not recite any specific technological improvement to \nmanufacturing. The \"Background of the Invention\" section of the patent specification explains, \n\"Computer -aided design (CAD) programs and systems may be used to design detailed three\u00ad\ndimensional models of physical objects, such as structural or mechanical parts of a structure or \ndevice.\" ('719 patent, 1:14-17). A CAD model generally includes design specifications such \nas \"welding characteristics, names of parts and components, [ and] dimensional references for \nsquaring.\" (Id., 1 :20-25). \"In order to complete the manufacturing process of a structure or \ndevice based on a [CAD] model, a human operator typically must program manually the \nmanufacturing machines associated with an assembly line based on the [CAD] display.\" (Id., \n1 The recent Federal Circuit cases cited by Ficep similarly claim specific technological \nimprovements, specific solutions, or \"describe in detail a step-by-step method for accomplishing \na physical process.\" XY, LLC v. Trans Ova Genetics, LC, 968 F.3d 1323, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2020); \nsee also EcoServices , LLC v. Certified Aviation Servs., 830 F. App'x 634, 642 (Fed. Cir. 2020) \n(finding that \"the claims of the '262 patent do not recite the mere desired result of automated jet \nengine washing, but rather, recite a specific solution for accomplishing that goal\"); CardioNet, \nLLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 955 F.3d 1358, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (finding that the claims '\"focus on \na specific means or method that improves' cardiac monitoring technology; they are not 'directed \nto a result or effect that itself is the abstract idea and merely invoke generic processes and \nmachinery\"' (quoting McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1314 (Fed. \nCir. 2016))). \n8 1 :26-30). To do this, a human operator would first review the CAD information and then input \nthe CAD specifications into the automated assembly line apparatus. (Id., 1 :32-41 ). \nThe specification explains that there are two problems with this prior art process: the \noperator might be unavailable or might make a mistake when inputting the information into the \nmanufacturing machine. (Id., 1:41-43, 53-55). The claimed invention aims to solve these \nproblems and increase efficiency by automatically providing the design parameters to the \nmanufacturing machine. (Id., 1 :44-49, 55-58). \nThe claims, however, describe only in general terms how one may receive, store, extract, \nidentify, and transmit the parameters to a manufacturing machine using generic computer \ntechnology. I believe the language of the claims crosses the line into directing the patent to the \nabstract idea itself as a solution to potential human error or operator absence. \nThe Federal Circuit's decision in University of Florida is instructive. In that case, the \npatent claimed a method and system for integrating physiologic treatment data by obtaining \ntreatment data from multiple bedside machines , converting that data to a \"machine independent \nformat,\" and displaying the results on a user interface. Univ. of Fla. Rsch. Found., Inc. v. Gen. \nElec. Co., 916 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2019). The Federal Circuit held that the claims were \ndirected to the abstract idea of collecting , analyzing , manipulating , and displaying data. Id. at \n1368. The Court held that the patent at issue was unpatentable because it simply sought to \nautomate the prior art \"'pen and paper methodologies ' to conserve human resources and \nminimize errors\" and failed to recite any specific improvement to the way computers operate. \nId. at 1367. The Court further reasoned that the claims failed to provide any technical details for \nthe tangible components and failed to recite how these components performed the conversion of \ndata. Id. at 1368. The '719 patent similarly seeks to simply automate the prior art methods to \n9 minimize human error and fails to recite any specific technological improvement to \nmanufacturing or computer technology. \nFicep argues that the claims as a whole are directed to improved manufacturing systems. \n(D.I. 53 at 11). Specifically, Ficep contends that the computer in the '719 patent identifies \nintersection parameters differently than how human operators would do so in the prior art. (Id. \nat 15). Ficep's expert Tim Chipman, a software developer, explains that prior to the '719 \npatent, if a company wanted to manufacture components of an intersecting structure, a human \noperator would need to analyze 2D drawings to find the intersection parameters. (D.I. 54 at 1 \n24). To do this, the operator would print out the 2D drawing and \"would typically use a tape \nmeasure and a marker ... to mark the intersection lines on the components.\" (Id.). Mr. \nChipman asserts that scribing machines, such as those disclosed in the patent, were not \n\"conventional in 2006,\" but even if they \"existed at that time,\" an operator would have \"to \nmanually program those intersection parameters into the machine.\" (Id. at 116). \nThe '719 patent automates this process by having a computer identify the intersection \nparameters instead of a human operator. Mr. Chipman contends that the computer performs this \ntask differently than what was done by hand. (Id. at 1 17). He explains, \"a likely way to \nidentify intersection parameters would be an iterative process in which for each component of \nthe object, it is compared with every other component of the object, to assess whether they \nintersect, using certain information about each component such as its type and dimensions. Then, \nonly after determining that two components do intersect are the intersection parameters ( e.g., \nlines/contours) created that define the intersection of the two components.\" (Id.). \nThe '719 patent specification, however, does not explain how the claimed invention \nidentifies the intersection parameters. More importantly, the claims contain no restrictions on \n10 how the processor identifies2 the intersection parameters , or how the other computerized steps \nare performed. (See, e.g., '719 patent, claim 7). Instead, the claims essentially recite a \"black \nbox\" processor that replaces the human operator in an unspecified manner. See, e.g., Dropbox, \nInc. v. Synchronoss Techs., Inc., 815 F. App'x 529,533 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (holding that a claim \nwas abstract because the specification treated the claimed tangible \"access checker\" as a \"black \nbox\" and \"functional abstraction \" that failed \"to describe how to solve the problem\" the patentee \nargued it addressed) ; id. at 536-37 (holding that a claim was \"abstract because it recited \nessentially the same process as a person manually transferring data from one mobile device to \nanother, with the person herself acting as the 'server'\" and \"fail[ ed] to provide specific \nexplanations or technical details describing how it improves the functionality of the generic \ncomponents \"). \nFicep also argues that the '719 patent is patentable because it is directed to a real-world \nsystem that manufactures real-world objects. (D.I. 53 at 8-13; Tr. at 4:11-19). While claim 7 \nrecites tangible components such as a \"computing device,\" a \"programmable logic controller ,\" \n2 Ficep argues that this Court must construe the term \"identifying \" before considering summary \njudgment under\u00a7 101. (D.I. 53 at 22-23). In the Joint Claim Construction Chart, Ficep \nproposes construing \"identifying a plurality of intersection and manufacturing parameters \" as \n\"identifying , without human intervention , a plurality of intersection and manufacturing \nparameters .\" (D .I. 69-1, Ex. A at 1 ). Peddinghaus proposes construing this term as \"locating \ntwo or more intersection [ and manufacturing parameters] in the design model.\" (Id.). Even if \nI were to adopt Ficep's proposed construction , the claim still fails to be directed to an improved \nmanufacturing system because the claim still does not address how the invention identifies the \nintersection parameters . (See, e.g., D.I. 30 at 16 (Report & Recommendation) (\"[C]laim \nconstruction might be needed before a final call can be made on this Section 101 issue. That is, \nthe Section 101 calculus could turn on exactly what the claim's reference to 'identif[ying] a \nplurality of intersection parameters' requires, and, from there, on how that process differs (if at \nall) from how a human calculated those parameters manually in working with prior art systems \nand processes. \")); Content Extraction, 776 F.3d at 1349 (finding that claims were patent\u00ad\nineligible even when construed in the manner most favorable to Plaintiff). \n11 and a \"manufacturing machine,\" the specification makes clear that the recited physical \ncomponents merely provide a generic environment in which to carry out the abstract idea. The \nspecification and claims do not describe a new or specialized computing device, programmable \nlogic controller, or manufacturing machine. The specification instead refers to these \ncomponents in generic terms. (See, e.g., '719 patent, 6:4-8 (\"The manufacturing machine 235 \nis a machine, such as a machine which forms a part of an assembly line, which assembles, marks \nout and/or welds, builds or creates all or part of the object to be manufactured or a component of \nthe object.\")). \nThe improvements described in the specification appear to originate exclusively with the \nremoval of human operators, achieved via the abstract idea. (See, e.g., id., 1:55-58, 5:26--30). \nThe claimed physical components are thus merely \"conduit[ s] for the abstract idea\" and do not \nsave the claims. See, e.g., Yu v. Apple, Inc., 1 F.4th 1040, 1043-45, 1044 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2021) \n(holding that claims directed to an \"improved digital camera\" were unpatentable because the \nclaims recited \"[ o ]nly conventional camera components\" performing the abstract idea of taking \ntwo pictures and using one picture to enhance the other picture in some way); In re TL! \nCommc'ns LLC Pat. Litig., 823 F.3d 607,612 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (concluding that the claimed \ntangible components were merely \"conduit[s] for the abstract idea\" partly because \"[t]he \nspecification fail[ed] to provide any technical details for the tangible components, but instead \npredominately describe[ d] the system and methods in purely functional terms\"). \nFurther, the claim limitation requiring the manufacture of components amounts to no \nmore than conventional post-solution activity and thus does not change the \u00a7 101 analysis. \nDiamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 191-92 (1981) (\"[I]nsignificant post-solution activity will not \ntransform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\"); Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco \n12 Holdings LLC, 967 F.3d 1285, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (holding that a method of manufacturing \nclaim was unpatentable ), petition for cert. filed, No. 20-891 (Dec. 28, 2020). \nGiven the claim language and the specification , I conclude that claim 7 is directed to the \nabstract idea of identifying , extracting, and transferring data from a design file for the purpose of \nmanufacturing an object. Thus, I proceed to Alice Step Two. \nC. Alice Step Two \nHaving decided that the claims are directed to an abstract idea, I must next \"examine the \nlimitations of the claims to determine whether the claims contain an 'inventive concept' to \n'transform' the claimed abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.\" Ultramercial , Inc. v. \nHulu, LLC, 772 F.3d 709, 715 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Alice, 573 U.S. at 221). \"A claim that \nrecites an abstract idea must include 'additional features' to ensure 'that the [claim] is more than \na drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea].\"' Alice, 573 U.S. at 221 (quoting \nMayo, 566 U.S. at 77) (alterations in original). Those \"additional features\" must be more than \n\"well-understood , routine, conventional activity.\" Ultramercial , 772 F.3d at 715 (quoting \nMayo, 566 U.S. at 79-80). \"Whether the claim elements or the claimed combination are well\u00ad\nunderstood, routine, conventional is a question of fact.\" Aatrix, 882 F.3d at 1128. \nNeither \"[a] simple instruction to apply an abstract idea on a computer ,\" nor \"claiming \nthe improved speed or efficiency inherent with applying the abstract idea on a computer \" \nsatisfies the requirement of an \"inventive concept.\" Intel/. Ventures I LLC v. Cap. One Bank \n(USA), 792 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2015). \"To salvage an otherwise patent-ineligible \nprocess, a computer must be integral to the claimed invention, facilitating the process in a way \nthat a person making calculations or computations could not.\" Bancorp Servs., L.L.C. v. Sun \nLife Assurance Co. of Can. (U.S.), 687 F.3d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \n13 Ficep and its expert argue that the claimed invention is inventive because it uses a \ncomputer to identify intersection parameters differently than how the human operator did so in \nthe prior art, and in a way that could not be done by hand. (D.I. 54 at ,r,r 17, 24). I accept Mr. \nChipman's declaration that a computer identifies the intersection parameters differently than how \na human would do so. But this limitation is not in the claims. Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast \nCable Commc 'ns, LLC, 874 F.3d 1329, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\"To save a patent at step two, an \ninventive concept must be evident in the claims.\"). Thus, I find that Mr. Chipman's declaration \ndoes not create a genuine issue of material fact as to inventiveness. See, e.g., Mortg. Grader, \nInc. v. First Choice Loan Servs. Inc., 811 F.3d 1314, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (concluding that \nexpert opinion about problems solved by the claimed invention did not create a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact when \"the claims do not actually contain\" the purported inventive concept). \nFicep also argues that it was not conventional to manufacture a component based on its \nintersection with a different component. (D.I. 53 at 4-5; Tr. at 42:11-19). But Ficep's expert \ndirectly contradicts this attorney argument. He explains that it was common for human \noperators to identify the intersection parameters by hand and manually mark the intersections on \nthe steel components.3 (D.I. 54 at ,r 16). The only purported advance over the prior art is that \nnow the machine, not the human, marks the steel beams with the intersections . (See '719 patent, \n1 :55-58; D.I. 53 at 18, 20). The claims are not directed to any improved or specialized \n3 Ficep has repeatedly stated that \"marking\" a component is one way to \"manufacture\" it based \non intersection parameters . (See D.I. 53 at 3 (\"The '719 patent explains that an example of such \nmanufacturing of components based on intersection parameters includes using those \nautomatically identified parameters to mark (e.g., scribe) lines onto the steel components that \nindicate where one steel component is supposed to connect to another steel component.\"); id. at \n20 n.4 (\"Layout marking by a machine is an example of the steps of 'manufactur[ing] the \ncomponents based at least in part ... on the transmitted intersection ... parameters.\"') ; see also \nid. at 4, 24). \n14 \"manufacturing machine,\" and fail to recite how the machine manufactures components based on \nintersection parameters. Instead, the claimed \"manufacturing machine\" is defined as a generic \n\"machine which forms a part of an assembly line, which assembles, marks out and/or welds, \nbuilds or creates all or part of the object to be manufactured or a component of the object.\" \n('719 patent, 6:5-8). Thus, the claimed machine is no more than a \"black box\" which replaces \nthe human operator and automatically performs the marking. See Dropbox, 815 F. App'x at \n533. Simply replacing the human operator with a conventional machine is not an inventive \nconcept and is not sufficient to transform the claims into patent-eligible subject matter. See \nContent Extraction, 776 F.3d at 1348. \nThe '719 patent specification makes clear that the main advantage of the patent comes \nfrom automating the processes previously performed by human operators, resulting in more \naccuracy and efficiency. (See, e.g., '719 patent, 1 :37-58, 5:26-30). Merely automating a \nprocess, however, is not an inventive concept. See, e.g., OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., \n788 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"[R]elying on a computer to perform routine tasks more \nquickly or more accurately is insufficient to render a claim patent eligible.\").4 \n4 Ficep also argues that the '719 patent's \"real-world ramifications\"-e.g., immediate industry \nrecognition, copying by others, commercial success, and licensing of the patent-support a \nfinding of inventiveness . (D.I. 53 at 19-21). However, I do not think it is appropriate to \nconsider secondary considerations of nonobviousness in determining patentability under \u00a7 101. \nSee WhitServe LLC v. Dropbox, Inc., 854 F. App'x 367,373 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (non-precedential) \n(\"Objecti[ve] indicia of nonobviousness are relevant in a\u00a7 103 inquiry, but not in a\u00a7 101 \ninquiry.\"), cert. denied, 2022 WL 89391 (U.S. Jan. 10, 2022); Two-Way Media Ltd v. Comcast \nCable Commc 'ns, LLC, 874 F.3d 1329, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\"Eligibility and novelty are \nseparate inquiries.\"). Even ifl were to consider this extrinsic evidence, I do not think it creates \na genuine issue of material fact as to whether the claims recite an \"inventive concept.\" For \nexample, the article praising Ficep's \"breakthrough\" seems to focus on the increased efficiency \nand accuracy from the automation of scribing as the main benefit of the invention. (See D.I. 53, \nEx. 1 (\"The automation solution eliminates errors, hastens the process, and at the same time \ncopes with the declining number of highly skilled fitters. It's no stretch to see how automated \n15 The '719 patent's generic and \"black box\"-type claiming also raises serious concerns of \npreemption. The broad claims here would preclude many, if not all, uses of a computer to \nidentify, extract, and transfer intersection information from design models for use in \nmanufacturing a multi-component object. \nThus, I conclude that the '719 patent claims fail under Alice Step Two. Ficep's attempts \nto raise factual disputes about whether the claimed processes were \"well-understood , routine, \n[and] conventional\" (D.I. 53 at 17-21) do not obviate the fact that the claims lack a \"specific, \ndiscrete implementation of the abstract idea.\" Dropbox, 815 F. App'x at 534 (quoting BASCOM \nGlob. Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). The \nclaims' high level of generality is not supplemented with any detail or additional features that \nexceed simply reciting the abstract idea. Content Extraction, 776 F.3d at 1347. I therefore \nconclude that the claims of the '719 patent are ineligible under\u00a7 101. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAn appropriate order will issue. \nmarking offers a significant upgrade over manual operations; even the best layout person is \nprone to make a measuring mistake or have his marking misinterpreted.\")). But, again, simply \nautomating a process, and thereby obtaining the significant benefits that come from automation, \ndoes not provide an inventive concept. \n16 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nFICEP CORPORATION , \nPlaintiff, \nV.
