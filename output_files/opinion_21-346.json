INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this patent infringement action is defendant Axalta Coating\nSystems, LLC\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cAxalta\u201d) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).! (D.I. 12) For\nthe following reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-PART\nAxalta\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nIl. BACKGROUND?\n\nOn March 5, 2021, plaintiffs PPG Industries Ohio, Inc. and PPG Industries, Inc.\n(\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d or \u201cPPG\u201d) filed this action alleging indirect and willful infringement of US. Patent\nNo. 7,981,505 (\u201cthe \u2019505 patent\u201d) by Axalta\u2019s accused Cromax\u00ae Pro, Chroma Premier\u00ae,\nChromaBase\u00ae, Vermeera\u2122, and Centari\u00ae products (the \u201cAccused Products\u201d). (D.I. 1) The\n*505 patent, entitled \u201cCoated Articles and Multi-Layer Coatings,\u201d discloses various coating\n! The briefing associated with the pending motion is found at D.I. 13, D.I. 16, and D.I. 17.\n\n2 The facts in this section are based upon allegations in the complaint, which the court accepts as\n\ntrue for the purposes of the present motion to dismiss. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., Inc.,\n542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\nsystems comprised of one, two, or three layers for creating uniquely colored surfaces on a\nsubstrate, typically the body of an automobile. (\u2019505 patent, cols. 1:24-42) To achieve the stated\npurpose of the invention, the 505 patent claims a specific type of \u201ctricoat\u201d process involving\ndepositing the component layers in three steps: (1) a metallic basecoat layer over the surface of a\nvehicle; (2) a color-imparting non-hiding midcoat layer over a portion of that basecoat layer; and\n(3) a clearcoat layer on top of the midcoat layer. (\u2018505 patent, cols. 26:22-39, 28:3-28; D.I. 1 at\n13,4)\n\nPPG won the Automotive News PACE Award in 2013 for its tint dispersion technology\nidentified by the tradename ANDARO\u00ae that practices the \u2018505 patent. (D.I. 1 at $3) In 2013,\nAxalta\u2019s foreign subsidiary, Axalta Coating Systems Germany GmbH (\u201cAxalta Germany\u201d),\nunsuccessfully opposed the grant of the \u2018505 patent\u2019s corresponding European Patent No.\n1776195. (ld. at J] 34, 42; D.I. 16, Ex. B)\n\nIll. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,\n790-91 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\n\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Igbal, 556 U.S. at\n663-64.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Contributory Infringement: Substantial Non-Infringing Use\n\nPursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c), a patentee must establish that an alleged contributory\ninfringer sold, offered to sell, or imported into the United States a component of an\ninfringing product \u201cknowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an\ninfringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for\nsubstantial noninfringing use.\u201d Netgear, Inc. v. Ruckus Wireless, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 2d 470, 476\n(D. Del. 2012) (quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c)). Thus, in order to sufficiently plead a contributory\ninfringement claim, the plaintiff must \u201cplead facts that allow an inference that the components\n\nsold or offered for sale have no substantial non-infringing uses.\u201d Jn re Bill of Lading\nTransmission & Processing Sys. Patent Litig., 681 F.3d 1323, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (emphasis\nadded).\n\nIn support of its motion to dismiss PPG\u2019s causes of action for contributory infringement\nof the \u2018505 patent, Axalta contends that PPG does not adequately plead a lack of substantial non-\ninfringing use. (D.I. 13 at 5-10) According to Axalta, PPG alters the statutory language,\nalleging that Axalta\u2019s products are \u201cespecially made or can be adapted for use in a multi-layer\ncoating system that infringes,\u201d? thereby acknowledging that the same products may also be used\nin a non-infringing manner. (/d. at 7-9, emphasis in original (quoting DI. 1 at \u00a743)) Axalta\nfurther contends that the \u2018505 patent itself discloses, but does not claim, two substantial non-\ninfringing uses for the claimed and accused components, namely a single-layer coating and a\ntwo-layer coating. (Id. at 8-9)\n\nIn response, PPG alleges that the complaint adequately pleads a lack of substantial non-\ninfringing uses because it alleges that the Accused Products are especially made for use in the\nmulti-layer coating system claimed in the \u2018505 patent, that the Accused Products can be adapted\nfor use in a multi-layer coating system that infringes, and that such products are \u201cnot a staple\narticle or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing use.\u201d* (D.I. 16 at 11-\n\n13 (citing D.I. 1 at $43))\n\n3 Axalta argues that PPG attempts to impermissibly amend its pleading in its brief to allege that\nthere are no substantial non-infringing uses by further altering the language in its complaint from\n\u201cthe Accused Products are especially made or can be adapted for use in a multi-layer coating\nsystem that infringes the \u2018505 Patent\u201d to \u201cthe Accused Products are especially made for use in a\nmulti-coating system that infringes the \u2018505 Patent, and can be adapted to do so.\u201d (D.I. 17 at 2,\nemphasis added (quoting D.I. 1 at \u00a2 43; D.I. 16 at 13))\n\n4 PPG also requests leave to amend its complaint should the court determine that the complaint\ndoes not sufficiently allege that there are no substantial non-infringing uses for the Accused\nProducts. (D.I. 16 at 13)\nThe court recommends dismissing PPG\u2019s causes of action for contributory infringement\nbecause the complaint provides no factual basis for the court to discern why it is plausible that\nthe Accused Products have no substantial non-infringing use. (D.I. 1 at \u00a2 43 (simply parroting\nthe language of the \u201cno substantial non-infringing use\u201d requirement)); See AgroFresh Inc. v.\nEssentiv LLC, C.A. No. 16-662-MN-SRF, 2018 WL 6974947, at *6 (D. Del. Dec. 27, 2018)\n(noting that \u201cCourts within this district have held that reciting this element of the cause of action,\nwithout more, is not sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)\u201d); See also\nTriDiNetworks Ltd. v. NXP-USA, Inc., C.A. No. 19-1062-CFC-CJB, 2020 WL 2514086, at *3-4\n(D. Del. May 15, 2020).\n\nThe \u2018505 patent claims a multi-layer coating system comprised of individual components,\nnamely a basecoat, midcoat, and clearcoat. (\u2018505 patent, cols. 26:22-39, 28:3-28) The complaint\nalleges that, when used together as instructed by Axalta, the Accused Products \u201chave the\ncapability of operating in a manner that infringes,\u201d but does not consider whether the Accused\nProducts may be used separately from a multi-coating system. (D.I. 1 at \u00a7 37, emphasis added);\nSee Pragmatus AV, LLC v. Yahoo! Inc., C.A. No. 11-902-LPS-CJB, 2012 WL 6044793, at *16\n(D. Del. Nov. 13, 2012), report and recommendation adopted, 2013 WL 2295344 (D. Del. May\n24, 2013) (\u201cThe mere allegation that [the accused product] may be used to infringe is not\nsufficient to allow a reasonable inference that, inter alia, [the accused product] has no substantial\nnoninfringing uses\u201d) (emphasis in original). Furthermore, the fact that \u201cpracticing the patented\nmethod may be the most logical or useful purpose for [defendant\u2019s] products does not render the\nalternative uses \u2018unusual, far-fetched, illusory, impractical, occasional, aberrant, or\nexperimental.\u2019\u201d Jn re Bill of Lading, 681 F.3d at 1337 (quoting Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic Holding,\n\nInc., 581 F.3d 1317, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).\nAdditionally, PPG cites BioM\u00e9rieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc. for the proposition that it need\nnot plead specific facts underlying the allegation of no substantial non-infringing use. However,\nPPG mischaracterizes the court\u2019s holding in that case, as the court did not indicate that plaintiffs\nneed not plead specific facts, but rather that plaintiffs adequately pleaded the lack of substantial\nnon-infringing uses by showing that the accused products could not operate without\nincorporating the patented screening technology. See BioM\u00e9rieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc., C.A.\nNo. 18-21-LPS, 2018 WL 4603267, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018). PPG\u2019s allegation that the\nAccused Products \u201ccan be adapted for use in a multi-layer coating system that infringes the \u2018505\nPatent\u201d does not plausibly plead facts that the three components can only be used together to\ninfringe the patent, thus, ruling out substantial non-infringing uses. Pleading the bare conclusion\nthat the Accused Products are not suitable for substantial non-infringing use is not sufficient to\nwithstand a motion to dismiss. See In re Bill of Lading, 681 F.3d at 1338 (\u201cWhere the product is\nequally capable of, and interchangeably capable of both infringing and substantial non-infringing\nuses, a claim for contributory infringement does not lie\u201d); See also Cross Med. Prods., Inc. v.\nMedtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., 424 F.3d 1293, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Therefore, the court\nrecommends dismissing PPG\u2019s causes of action for contributory infringement.\n\nB. Indirect Infringement: Knowledge of the Patent\n\n1. Pre-Suit Knowledge of the Patent\nClaims of induced and contributory infringement both \u201crequire proof that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct occurred after the defendant (1) knew of the existence of the asserted patent and (2)\nknew that a third party\u2019s acts constituted infringement of the patent.\u201d* ZapFraud, Inc. v.\nBarracuda Networks, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 3d 247, 249 (D. Del. 2021); See Global-Tech\n\n5 For purposes of the pending motion, Axalta is not challenging that third parties\u2019 acts constitute\ndirect infringement. (See D.I. 13) Therefore, the court need not address this element.\nAppliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 765-66 (2011). Knowledge of the existence of the\nasserted patent can be shown by willful blindness.\u00b0 See Global-Tech Appliances, 563 U.S. at\n768.\n\nPPG\u2019s complaint alleges that Axalta had knowledge of or was willfully blind to the \u2018505\npatent because (1) PPG won the Automotive News PACE Award in 2013 for its ANDARO\u00ae\npigment dispersion technology that practices the \u2018505 patent (the \u201cAward\u201d); (2) Axalta\u2019s foreign\nsubsidiary\u2019 unsuccessfully opposed European Patent No. 1776195, a foreign counterpart to the\n\u2018505 patent; and (3) the complaint put Axalta on notice of the \u2018505 patent. (D.I. 1 at ff 3, 34, 35,\n42)\n\nAxalta argues that PPG does not adequately plead that Axalta had pre-suit knowledge of\nthe \u00b0505 patent. (D.I. 13 at 10-13) First, Axalta argues that the complaint does not allege that\nAxalta knew of the Award or that the Award identified the \u2018505 patent, disclosed that the\ntechnology was patented, or disclosed the dispersion technology as a multi-layer coating system.\n(Ud. at 4, 10-11) In response, PPG argues that it is plausible to infer that Axalta would take\nnotice of PPG\u2019s award-winning technology published in industry papers because the technology\nwas \u201cwell-known in the automotive industry\u201d and touted as a \u201cgame changer\u201d and as having a\n\n\u201csignificant market impact.\u201d (D.I. 16 at 6-7)\n\n6 \u201c7K Inowledge based on willful blindness exists only where \u2018(1) the defendant [ ] subjectively\nbelieve[d] that there [was] a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the defendant [ ] [took]\ndeliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.\u2019\u201d VLSI Tech. LLC v. Intel Corp., C.A. No. 18-\n966-CFC, 2019 WL 1349468, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 26, 2019) (quoting Global-Tech Appliances,\n563 U.S. at 769).\n\n7 The complaint alleges that Axalta\u2019s subsidiary unsuccessfully opposed the grant of the \u2018505\npatent\u2019s corresponding European patent. (D.I. 1 at 34, 42) Both parties\u2019 briefing indicates,\nhowever, that the foreign patent was opposed by a foreign subsidiary of Axalta\u2019s predecessor.\n(D1. 13 at 11; D.I. 16 at 7-8)\nPPG\u2019s allegations involving the Award do not plausibly plead Axalta\u2019s pre-suit\nknowledge of the \u2018505 patent. The complaint alleges that Axalta had knowledge of the Award,\nby stating that \u201cUpon information and belief, Axalta had actual knowledge of or was willfully\nblind to the 505 Patent in 2013 after PPG won an award for its ANDARO[\u00ae] technology.\u201d\n(D.I. 1 at ]42) Nevertheless, absent from the complaint are allegations bridging knowledge of\nthe Award with knowledge of the patent. The complaint does not allege that the Award\ndisclosed the multi-layer coating system claimed by the \u2018505 patent or that the technology was\npatented. (/d. at [] 3, 34, 38, 42) Moreover, the CompositesWorld Award announcement\nincluded as a link in the complaint does not disclose the ANDARO\u00ae technology as a three-layer\ncoating system, does not reference the \u2018505 patent, and does not disclose that the technology is\npatented.\u00ae (/d. at \u00a2 3)\n\nFurthermore, PPG\u2019s allegations that Axalta had knowledge of the patent because the\npatent and award-winning technology were well-known in the automotive industry cannot, by\nitself, support an inference that Axalta had pre-suit knowledge of the \u2018505 patent. See SoftView\nLLC vy. Apple Inc., C.A. No. 10-389-LPS, 2012 WL 3061027, at *6 (D. Del. July 26, 2012)\n(finding that media publicity surrounding third-party litigation involving the patent-in-suit does\nnot plausibly allege pre-suit knowledge of the patent); See also MONEC Holding AG v.\nMotorola Mobility, Inc., 897 F. Supp. 2d 225, 232-33 (D. Del. 2012) (\u201cThis court has not been\n\nconvinced of the sufficiency of pleadings charging knowledge that is based upon a defendant's\n\n8 The Composites World Award announcement describes that \u201cAndaro tint dispersions enable\nautomotive manufacturers to achieve more vibrant colors, especially in the flop (horizontal)\nangle...[and] achieve a deep, pure and more chromatic color space than do traditional pigments,\nhelping accentuate the feature lines and design characteristics of the vehicle.\u201d PPG Wins PACE\nAward for Andaro Tint Dispersions, Composites World (Apr. 25, 2013),\nhttps://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ppg-wins-pace-award-for-andaro-tint-dispersions.\nparticipation in the same market, media publicity and unrelated litigation by the defendant\u2019s\ncompetitors concerning the relevant patent\u201d).\n\nNor do bare allegations of Axalta\u2019s participation in the automotive industry support an\ninference of pre-suit knowledge. See EON Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. FLO TV Inc., 802 F. Supp.\n2d 527, 533-534 (D. Del. 2011) (declining to infer knowledge of the patent \u201cby virtue of\n[defendants\u2019] participation in the [relevant] market\u201d); See also ELM 3DS Innovations, LLC v. SK\nHynix Inc., 14-1432-LPS-CJB, 2016 WL 1274803, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2016). In ELM 3DS\nInnovations, the court found the complaint sufficiently alleged pre-suit knowledge of the patent\nbecause it included allegations indicating common knowledge of the patent-in-suit, along with\nallegations that defendants worked to standardize technologies related to the patent-in-suit. ELM\n3DS Innovations, 2016 WL 1274803, at *1. The court noted, however, without that additional\nfactual support, \u201cnumerous cases have found that factual allegations based on general\nparticipation in a relevant market may not form a basis for inferring actual knowledge of a\nparticular patent.\u201d Id.\n\nAxalta next argues that pre-suit knowledge of the \u2018505 patent cannot be demonstrated by\nthe allegation that a foreign subsidiary of Axalta\u2019s predecessor unsuccessfully opposed a\nEuropean patent related to the \u2018505 patent. (D.I. 13 at 11-12) According to Axalta, the\ncomplaint does not allege that Axalta itself had knowledge of the Opposition proceeding. (Id.)\nFurther, Axalta argues that the European patent contains different claims and only references the\npatent application that later issued as the \u2018505 patent. (/d. at 12) In response, PPG argues that\nthe complaint recites specific factual allegations demonstrating that Axalta\u2019s foreign subsidiary,\nAxalta Germany, opposed the grant of a \u201ccorresponding\u201d or related European patent that \u201cclaims\n\nvirtually identical subject matter.\u201d (D.I. 16 at 7-9; D.I. 1 at [{ 34, 42) PPG asserts that, at the\nvery least, these allegations establish pre-suit knowledge through Axalta\u2019s willful blindness.\nUd.)\n\nPPG\u2019s allegations in the complaint involving the foreign Opposition proceeding do not\nsupport a reasonable inference that Axalta learned of the \u2018505 patent. (D.L. 1 at f\u00a5 34, 42)\nKnowledge of a foreign patent does not provide notice of a \u201ccorresponding\u201d U.S. patent. See,\ne.g., MONEC Holding, 897 F. Supp. 2d at 233 (holding that knowledge of an original patent does\nnot equate to actual knowledge of even a reexamined patent). Moreover, a \u201c[p]laintiff needs to\nset out more than just the bare fact of the parent/subsidiary relationship in order to make out a\nplausible claim that the U.S. Defendants had the requisite knowledge of the patent-in-suit.\u201d\nVarian Med. Sys., Inc. v. Elekta AB, C.A. No. 15-871-LPS-CJB, 2016 WL 3748772, at *5 (D.\nDel. July 12, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 WL 9307500 (D. Del. Dec. 22,\n2016) (emphasis in original); See also SoftView, 2012 WL 3061027, at *5. Finally, the\ncomplaint only avers bare allegations of willful blindness without plausible facts supporting the\nconclusion that Axalta had pre-suit knowledge of the patent. (D.I. 1 at J\u00a5 34, 42)\n\nAdditionally, PPG attaches to its answering brief nearly one thousand extraneous pages\nof exhibits, including an Axalta SEC filing and the European patent file history wrapper, to\nsupport further allegations that Axalta\u2019s predecessor-in-interest, DuPont Performance Coating\nGmbH (\u201cDupont\u201d), initiated the foreign Opposition proceeding, that Axalta requested transfer of\nthe Opposition from DuPont to Axalta Germany, and that Axalta requested permission for its\nsenior researcher to attend the Opposition proceeding. (D.L. 16 at 7-8, Ex. A-E)\n\nThe court recommends rejecting these new allegations and PPG\u2019s attempt to amend its\npleading in its answering brief. Moreover, the court will not consider voluminous, extraneous\n\nmaterial which has not been referenced in the original complaint. See Pa. ex rel. Zimmerman v.\n\n10\nPepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988) (noting that the complaint may not be amended\nby the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss); See also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec.\nLitig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (\u201ca district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may\nnot consider matters extraneous to the pleadings\u201d). Therefore, the court recommends granting\nAxalta\u2019s motion to dismiss the claims of indirect infringement that are based on pre-suit\nknowledge of the patent.\n\n2. Post-Suit Knowledge of the Patent\n\nBecause the court has found that PPG failed to adequately allege pre-suit knowledge of\nthe \u2018505 patent, the court must further consider whether notice of the patent first obtained from\nservice of the complaint may support a claim for post-filing indirect infringement. See SoftView,\n2012 WL 3061027, at *7.\n\nAxalta argues that PPG\u2019s claims for indirect infringement should be dismissed to the\nextent PPG relies on service of the complaint to serve as the basis for Axalta\u2019s actionable\nknowledge. (D.I. 13 at 12-13) In response, PPG argues that service of the complaint is\nsufficient to provide knowledge of the patent-in-suit for purposes of stating a claim for indirect\ninfringement occurring after the filing date. (D.I. 16 at 10-11)\n\nOn this issue, there is divided precedent in this District. See SoftView, 2012 WL\n3061027, at *7. Here, the court recommends finding that the filing of the complaint is sufficient\nnotice for an induced infringement claim based on post-filing conduct. See id. (\u201cIn the Court\u2019s\nview, an accused infringer is on notice of the patent(s)-in-suit once an initial pleading identifies\nthe patents-in-suit, and a patentee that successfully proves the remaining legal elements of\nindirect infringement is entitled to recover for any post-filing indirect infringement of those\n\npatents\u201d); See also IOENGINE, LLC v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 18-452-WCB, 18-826-\n\n11\nWCB, 2019 WL 330515, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 25, 2019) (finding that \u201cAs to [defendant\u2019s] post-\nsuit activities... knowledge of the patents was clearly conveyed to [defendant] by the service of\nthe complaint\u201d); See also Pragmatus Telecom, LLC v. Ford Motor Co., C.A. No. 12-92-RGA,\n2012 WL 2700495, at *1 (D. Del. July 5, 2012) (noting that service of the complaint is sufficient\nto provide notice of the patent in support of a claim for post-filing indirect infringement).\nAccordingly, the court recommends denying Axalta\u2019s motion to dismiss to the extent it seeks\ndismissal of PPG\u2019s indirect infringement allegations based on post-filing conduct.\n\nC. Willful Infringement\n\nTo state a claim for willful infringement, the pleading \u201cmust allege facts plausibly\nshowing that as of the time of the claim\u2019s filing, the accused infringer: (1) knew of the patent-in-\nsuit; (2) after acquiring that knowledge, it infringed the patent; and (3) in doing so, it knew, or\nshould have known, that its conduct amounted to infringement of the patent.\u201d Valinge\nInnovation AB v. Halstead New England Corp., C.A. No. 16-1082-LPS-CJB, 2018 WL 2411218,\nat *13 (D. Del. May 29, 2018); See VLSI Tech., 2019 WL 1349468, at *1 (stating that knowledge\nof the patent and knowledge of infringement are elements of willful, induced, and contributory\ninfringement). For the reasons previously stated at \u00a7 IV.B.1, supra, the complaint does not\nplausibly allege that Axalta had pre-suit knowledge of the \u2018505 patent. Moreover, the complaint\ncontains a single conclusory allegation, that \u201cAxalta is indirectly infringing the \u2018505 patent in a\nmanner best described as willful, wanton, malicious, in bad faith, deliberate, consciously\nwrongful, or flagrant.\u201d (D.I. 1 at ]38) Therefore, the court recommends granting Axalta\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss PPG\u2019s willful infringement claim.\n\n12\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-\nPART without prejudice Axalta\u2019s motion to dismiss. (D.I. 12) Because this is the first time the\ncourt has found these claims to be deficiently pleaded and because leave to amend should be\ngiven freely \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), the court recommends that\ndismissal of the complaint be without prejudice.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: January 2l, 2022\n\n13\n"}
