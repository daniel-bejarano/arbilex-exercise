(\"BOA\")'s Motion for \nSummary Judgment on Priorities of Claims and Order for Return of Deposit (D.I. 102); \nand Atlas Uluslararasi Kumanyac1hk tic A.S and Atlas Gemi V analari ve Ekipmanlari \nTic Ltd Sti (together, \"Atlas\")'s Motion for Entry of Summary Judgment Pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56 (D.I. 103). These motions relate to the disbursement of the funds in the \nCourt's registry. I have reviewed the parties' briefing. (D.I. 101, 102, 104, 106, 107, \n108, 111, 112, 113). \nOn May 19, 2020, Atlas brought this action against MN ARICA, IMO 9399741 \n(\"the Vessel\"), in rem, and against FS Arica, Ltd., in personam , for FS Arica' s failure to \npay for the maritime necessaries Atlas provided to the Vessel. (D.I. 1). On May 22, \n2020, Calpam intervened as a co-plaintiff for the non-payment of an invoice for bunkers \n(fuel) supplied to the Vessel. (D.I. 20, 42). On July 6, 2020, BOA intervened as a co-\nl plaintiff, seeking to foreclose on its Liberian preferred ship mortgage over the Vessel. \n(D.I. 56, 75).1 I have entered default judgments for Atlas's, Calpam's, and BOA's \nrespective claims. (D.I. 62, 84, 99).2 \nBOA's nominee bought the Vessel on a credit bid of $6.5 million. (D.I. 68). In \nconsideration of the credit bid, BOA deposited $480,263.72 into the Court's registry to \n\"guarantee the payment of all claims or liens on the [Vessel], if any, which shall be held \nby the Court to be superior to [BOA]'s claim.\" (D.I. 61).3 As of March 10, 2022, the \nCourt's registry has an account balance of $605,672.61. \nAtlas and Calpam ask this Court to order the payment of their maritime liens from \nthe Court's registry. (D.I. 101 at 7; D.I. 104 at 12). BOA asks this Court to order the \nreturn of its registry deposit. (D.I. 102 at 9). Thus, the sole issue before the Court is the \npriority of the parties' claims. \nI. DISCUSSION \nThere is no dispute that BOA has a valid preferred ship mortgage on the Vessel, \nwhich has priority over Atlas's and Calpam's maritime liens.4 Atlas and Calpam argue, \n1 Network Shipping Limited also intervened as a co-plaintiff. Network's claim was \ndismissed on January 28, 2021. (D.I. 93). \n2 Atlas obtained a judgment of $100,051.59. (D.I. 62). Calpam obtained a judgment of \n$151,573.85, plus interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum running from May 20, \n2020, until the judgment is satisfied, along with costs. (D.I. 84). BOA obtained a \njudgment of $16,198,373.58, plus interest accrued from June 29, 2020, until the judgment \nis satisfied, along with costs. (D.I. 99). \n3 BOA also deposited $125,000 as an \"earnest money deposit\" through the U.S. Marshals \nService. (D.I. 36, ,r 3; D.I. 61). \n4 Pursuant to the U.S. Ship Mortgage Act, \"[T]he preferred mortgage lien, including a \npreferred mortgage lien on a foreign vessel whose mortgage has been guaranteed under \nchapter 537 of this title, has priority over all claims against the vessel (except for \nexpenses and fees allowed by the court, costs imposed by the court, and preferred \n2 however, that this Court should equitably subordinate BOA's mortgage claim. Calpam \nalternatively argues that the bunkers it supplied were never the vessel owner's property \nand thus were never subject to BOA's mortgage. I will address each argument in turn. \nA. Equitable Subordination \nOriginally developed in bankruptcy law, the doctrine of equitable subordination \npermits the court, in the exercise of its equitable powers, to subordinate a superior \nranking lien to a junior lien based on the inequitable conduct of the superior lien holder. \nWardley Int'l Bank, Inc. v. Nasipit Bay Vessel, 841 F.2d 259,263 (9th Cir. 1988). It is \nwell-established that courts may apply the doctrine of equitable subordination in \nadmiralty cases. Id.; Custom Fuel Servs., Inc. v. Lombas Indus., Inc., 805 F.2d 561,566 \n(5th Cir. 1986). \nTo justify the equitable subordination of an otherwise valid claim, the movant \nmust show: (1) the claimant engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) the \nmisconduct resulted in injury to the creditors of the bankrupt or conferred an unfair \nadvantage on the claimant; and (3) equitable subordination of the claim is not \ninconsistent with the law. Custom Fuel Servs., 805 F.2d at 566. \"Three types of \ninequitable conduct are sufficient to warrant subordination: '(1) fraud, illegality, breach \nmaritime liens).\" 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31326(b)(l). The U.S. Ship Mortgage Act defines \n\"preferred mortgage \" as \"a mortgage, hypothecation , or similar charge that is established \nas a security on a foreign vessel if the mortgage , hypothecation , or similar charge was \nexecuted under the laws of the foreign country under whose laws the ownership of the \nvessel is documented and has been registered under those laws in a public register at the \nport ofregistry of the vessel or at a central office.\" 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31301(6)(B). Atlas and \nCalpam do not dispute that BOA followed the necessary procedures to obtain a preferred \nmortgage under \u00a7 31301 ( 6)(B). \n3 of fiduciary duties; (2) undercapitalization; and (3) claimant's use of the debtor as a mere \ninstrumentality or alter ego.\"' Id. \nAs a preliminary matter, BOA argues, \"The 'prerequisite' to the first prong of the \n[equitable subordination] test is 'a showing that the claimant is in a position of control \nover the debtor.\"' (D.I. 107 at 3 (quoting Custom Fuel Servs., 805 F.2d at 566)). Atlas \ndoes not address this argument, and Calpam responds that BOA did have control over FS \nArica because it froze FS Arica's bank accounts in April 2020. (D.I. 112 at 5). \nI do not think that BO A's freezing of FS Arica's bank account upon default rises \nto the level of control required by Custom Fuel. There, the \"control\" prong was satisfied \nbecause the mortgagee \"own[ed] all [the mortgagor 's] stock and control[ed] its board of \ndirectors\" and caused its subsidiary to grant the mortgage. Custom Fuel Servs., 805 F .2d \nat 566. In contrast, BOA does not appear to have any control over FS Arica's business \nand did not control the form of the mortgage. BOA was instead simply exercising its \ncontractual rights as a holder of a preferred mortgage lien, which it obtained through an \narms-length transaction. Thus, Calpam and Atlas have failed to show that BOA was in a \nposition of control over FS Arica, precluding a finding of equitable subordination. If \nCustom Fuel correctly states Third Circuit law, as the parties assume, that would be the \nend of the analysis. 5 \n5 There are no Third Circuit admiralty cases applying equitable subordination, so it is \nunclear whether the Third Circuit would adopt such a requirement. The Third Circuit, \nhowever, does not require a showing of control as a prerequisite to equitable \nsubordination in bankruptcy cases. \"The type of misconduct that will satisfy the first \nprong [of the equitable subordination test] varies depending on whether the alleged bad \nactor is an 'insider' of the debtor.\" United States v. State St. Bank & Tr. Co., 520 B.R. \n29, 81 (Bankr. D. Del. 2014). \"If the claimant is not an insider, then evidence of more \n4 Nevertheless , I continue. Even ifl were to find that BOA was in a position of \ncontrol over the debtor, Atlas and Calpam would still have failed to show that BOA \nengaged in inequitable conduct, which is required for the application of equitable \nsubordination. \nAtlas and Calpam point to three instances of BO A's \"inequitable conduct.\" First, \nthey assert that BOA and its predecessor Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale \n(\"Nord/LB\") failed to timely declare default. Specifically , on December 31, 2018, FS \nArica breached the minimum liquidity covenant of the loan agreement. (D.I. 104-1, Ex. \nB). Nord/LB \"tolerated\" this breach and did not declare default. (Id., Ex. A at 16:17-\n25). BOA knew FS Arica was in default when it purchased the mortgage from Nord/LB \non March 2, 2020. (Id., Ex. A at 13:24-14:15). BOA, however, did not issue a notice \nof default on the mortgage until April 17, 2020, after FS Arica failed to make a payment. \n(Id., Ex. B). Atlas and Calpam argue that BOA's and Nord/LB 's conduct was \ninequitable because they \"knowingly permitted an insolvent FS Arica to continue \naccruing debts which [BOA] and Nord/LB knew, by way of the minimum liquidity \nbreach, FS Arica could not pay.\" (D.I. 104 at 11). \negregious conduct such as fraud, spoliation or overreaching is necessary .\" Schubert v. \nLucent Techs. Inc. (In re Winstar Commc'ns, Inc.), 554 F.3d 382,412 (3d Cir. 2009) \n(quoting Fabricators , Inc. v. Tech. Fabricators , Inc. (In re Fabricators , Inc.), 926 F.2d \n1458, 1465 (5th Cir. 1991)) (cleaned up). Even ifl were to apply Third Circuit \nbankruptcy law to this admiralty claim, I would reach the same result-no equitable \nsubordination. BOA is not an insider of FS Arica; thus, \"more egregious conduct\" is \nrequired to support a finding of equitable subordination. As I discuss infra, Atlas and \nCalpam have failed to show that BOA engaged in inequitable conduct, let alone \"more \negregious conduct.\" \n5 In support, Atlas cites Cantieri Navali Riuniti v. M/V Skyptron, 621 F. Supp. 171 \n(W.D. La. 1985), aff'd on other grounds, 802 F.2d 160 (5th Cir. 1986). In Cantieri, the \ndistrict court equitably subordinated the preferred ship mortgage because the mortgagee \nknew the mortgagor was in default yet waited two years to foreclose. Id. at 187. The \ndistrict court reasoned that since the mortgagee's agent shared office space with the \nmortgagor and monitored its financial statements , the mortgagee \" was close enough to \nthe action to hear the financial wolves at [the mortgagor 's] door, yet continued to allow \nthe vessel and its operators to slip further into debt.\" Id. \nIn this case, however, there is no evidence that BOA had this high degree of \nintimacy with FS Arica or that it could \"hear the financial wolves\" at FS Arica's door. \nInstead, BOA's corporate representative testified that BOA had \"no reasons to believe \n[ when it acquired the loan] that the borrower would have significant unpaid amounts to \nsuppliers other than in the ordinary course of business, \" because \"the borrower was in \ncompliance with the repayment schedule of the loan,\" and \"the vessels ... were earning \nand were chartered amounts that should have been capable of covering normal operating \nexpenses of vessels of this type.\" (D.I. 104-1, Ex. A at 18:22-19:10). Thus, Cantieri is \nnot applicable here. See Key Bank of Puget Sound v. Alaskan Harvester , 738 F. Supp. \n398,403 (W.D. Wash. 1989) (declining to follow Cantieri where \"only six months \nelapsed between the first scheduled payment and the declaration of default\" and \"no \nevidence [was] offered ... approximating the degree of intimacy between the mortgagee \nand the mortgagor that impressed the court in Cantieri''). \n6 Atlas and Calpam also cite Gulf Oil Trading Co. v. Creole Supply, 596 F.2d 515 \n(2d Cir. 1979). In Gulf Oil, the mortgagee Chase knew that the mortgagor was in default \nof payment. Id. at 519. Instead of foreclosing on the vessels, \"Chase lured Gulf into \nsupplying the bunkers on credit when Chase knew that the vessels had no cash.\" Id. at \n520. Chase then directed the vessels to move to a more desirable location, using the \nbunkers supplied by Gulf. Id. at 519. The Court equitably subordinated Chase's \nmortgage , holding, \"Chase was unjustly enriched, for without the bunkers the vessels \ncould not have sailed away to avoid a foreclosure in the United States that would have \nimperiled Chase's priority over suppliers.\" Id. \nThe conduct in Gulf Oil was far more egregious than BOA's conduct here. The \nmortgagee in Gulf Oil intentionally improved its own position at the expense of other \ncreditors. It had express knowledge that the mortgagor could not pay for the bunkers but \nstill accepted them so that it could move the vessel. In contrast, BOA did not have any \nreason to believe that FS Arica was unable to pay Atlas and Calpam. (D.I. 104-1, Ex. A \nat 18 :22-19: 10). Additionally , the only potential benefit that BOA received from \nAtlas's and Calpam's provision of maritime necessaries and bunkers was in the form of \nloan payments. This \"benefit\" does not compare to Chase's direct use of Gulfs bunkers \nto travel to another country to avoid the foreclosure by other creditors. \nFS Arica's breach of the minimum liquidity covenant was a \"technical default,\" \nnot a payment default. FS Arica was still \"in compliance with the repayment schedule \nof the loan.\" (Id. at 19:2-3). When FS Arica first defaulted on a payment on April 14, \n2020, BOA issued a notice of default within three days. (Id., Ex. B). I do not think that \n7 BOA and Nord/LB 's decision not to call default on a loan due to a technical covenant \nbreach, when the borrower was still making payments, was unreasonable. See Dresdner \nBank AG v. MIV Olympia Voyager, 463 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir. 2006) (\"The \npostponement of a declaration of default on a loan for a reasonable period of time, by \nitself, is insufficient to warrant equitable subordination of the Banks' preferred ship \nmortgage .\"). There does not seem to be any reason for a creditor to go through the steps \nof foreclosure when it is still receiving payments from the borrower. This conduct \ncertainly does not rise to the level of egregious misconduct which has warranted \nequitable subordination in other cases.6 See, e.g., Branch Banking & Tr. Co. of Va. v. \nMIY Beowulf, 883 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1218-19 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (applying doctrine of \nequitable subordination where mortgagee granted mortgagor a five-year extension even \nthough mortgagor \"had just defaulted on a $ 800,000 balloon payment, presented with a \nstunning debt-to-income ratio of 157%, reported an $11 million decrease in net worth, \nand was besieged with tax liens\"). \nSecond, Atlas and Calpam point to the \"blocking order\" issued by BOA on April \n17, 2020. This blocking order froze FS Arica's bank account and required FS Arica to \n6 Atlas also suggests that FS Arica' s violation of the minimum liquidity covenant shows \nundercapitalization. (D.I 104 at 10; D.I. 113 at 2). \"Capitalization is inadequate if in \nthe opinion of a skilled financial analyst, it would definitely be insufficient to support a \nbusiness of the size and nature of the bankrupt in light of the circumstances existing at the \ntime the bankrupt was capitalized ,\" or if \"at the time when the advances were made, the \nbankrupt could not have borrowed a similar amount of money from an informed outside \nsource.\" Benjamin v. Diamond (In re Mobile Steel Co.), 563 F.2d 692, 703 (5th Cir. \n1977); Yasi v. MIV Horizon's Edge, 2015 WL 3454718, at *6 (D. Mass. May 29, 2015). \nAtlas fails to make any argument showing that this standard is met and instead makes \nvague references to \"undercapitalization. \" Thus, I do not find any showing of \nundercapitalization. \n8 obtain BOA's \"prior written consent\" before paying debts. (D.I. 101-2, Ex. 2). Atlas \nand Calpam argue that this blocking order prevented FS Arica from paying them, while \nBOA likely took that money to pay its mortgage. (D.I. 101 at 7; D.I. 113 at 6). \nI decline to subordinate BOA's claim on this basis. Atlas and Calpam do not cite \nany case where the court has equitably subordinated a mortgage based on a mortgagee 's \nfreeze of the mortgagor 's bank account. BOA froze FS Arica's bank account after FS \nArica defaulted on a payment. This action was justifiable to protect BOA's security \ninterest, and there is no evidence suggesting that BOA froze FS Arica's accounts for any \nother purpose. See Sloan v. Zions First Nat'! Bank (In re Castletons , Inc.), 990 F.2d \n551, 558-59 (10th Cir. 1993) (affirming the district court's dismissal of an equitable \nsubordination claim \"based upon allegations that [the mortgagee] froze debtor's checking \naccounts and offset the amount of those accounts against debts owed to [the mortgagee]\" \nand finding that the mortgagee \"took appropriate , justifiable actions to protect its security \ninterest\"). \nThird, Atlas argues .that BOA was \"unjustly enriched\" at the expense of Atlas and \nCalpam. (D.I. 104 at 10-11 ). Sometime after BOA issued a notice of default, it \nforeclosed on the mortgage not only of the Vessel but also on mortgages on four other \nvessels. BOA then privately sold the vessels and re-mortgaged the vessels to new buyers \nfor $76,648,760.57 around October 2020. (D.I. 104-1, Exs. C-E). When BOA \nintervened in this action in July 2020, $38,692,675.58 of its original mortgage was \noverdue. (D.I. 56 at ,r 24). Atlas argues that BOA would not have been able to re\u00ad\nmortgage the vessels for nearly twice the amount in the original, intervening complaint \n9 without Atlas and Calpam supplying the maritime necessaries which kept the Vessel in \noperation. (DJ. 104 at 11). Thus, BOA received a \"200% windfall\" at the expense of \nAtlas and Calpam. (Id.). \nBOA responds that its re-mortgage of the vessels does not constitute a \"windfall\" \nbecause BOA advanced new funds to new borrowers. (DJ. 107 at 14-15). \nSpecifically, it financed the acquisition of the cross-collateralized vessels and financed \ntheir operation, maintenance, and repair. (Id.; see also DJ. 107-4, Ex. 4). \nAtlas fails to show that BO A's re-mortgage of the vessels rises to level of \"sham \ntransaction\" sufficient to justify equitable subordination here. TMF Tr. Ltd. v. Monjasa \nLtd., 799 F. App'x 559, 560 (9th Cir. 2020) (declining equitable subordination argument \nbecause the movant did not provide any evidence that ''the financial transaction was a \nsham\" (quoting Wardley Int'! Bank, Inc. v. Nasipit Bay Vessel, 841 F.2d 259,263 (9th \nCir. 1988))); Off Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of HH Liquidation , LLC v. Comvest \nGrp. Holdings, LLC (In re HH Liquidation , LLC), 590 B.R. 211,298 (Bankr. D. Del. \n2018) (\"Equitable subordination is 'an extraordinary remedy which is applied \nsparingly.\"' (internal citation omitted)). It is not inequitable for BOA to obtain a new \nmortgage after advancing new funds to new borrowers. Further, it seems speculative \nthat this re-mortgage would not have been possible without Atlas providing maritime \nnecessaries, especially because BOA provided funds to support the Vessel's operation. \nBecause Atlas and Calpam have failed to show that BOA engaged in inequitable \nconduct, I decline to apply the doctrine of equitable subordination to BOA's preferred \nship mortgage. \n10 B. Calpam's Retention of Title to the Bunkers \nCalpam alternatively argues that the bunkers it supplied were never the vessel \nowner's property and thus were never subject to BOA's mortgage. (D.I. 101 at 5-6). \nOn April 16, 2020, NSC Shipping GmbH & Cie. KG, acting on behalf ofFS Arica, \nplaced an order for bunkers to be delivered to the Vessel in Jamaica. (D.I. 101-1, Ex. 1, \n1 2). In response to this order, Calpam sent NSC a copy of its standard terms and \nconditions. (Id). Calpam's terms and conditions contain a retention-of-title provision, \nwhich provides: \nTitle to the Marine Fuels shall pass to the Buyer upon full payment for the \nMarine Fuels delivered , pursuant to the terms of clause 8 (Payment) hereof. \nUntil such time as payment is made in full, the Buyer agrees that it is in \npossession of the Marine Fuels solely as bailee for the Seller. \n(Id, Ex. B to Ex. 1, \u00a7 1 0(b) ). Calpam argues that since FS Arica never paid for the \nbunkers, it never obtained title to the bunkers under this retention-of-title provision. \nCalpam's terms and conditions contain a choice-of-law clause, which provides: \nThis agreement and all agreement (sic) subject to these GTC shall be governed \nexclusively by the substantive laws of the Federal Republic of Germany (to the \nexclusion of the Convention for the International Sale of Goods and the conflict of \nlaw provisions). \n(Id, \u00a7 20(a)). Both parties agree that, under this choice-of-law clause, German law \ngoverns the bunker-supply agreement between Calpam and FS Arica. The parties \ndispute, however, whether German conflict-of-law rules apply. Dr. Volker Kammel, \nwho submitted a declaration on behalf of BOA, states, \"The conflict rules applicable in \nGermany ... are mandatory provisions and cannot be excluded by an agreement of the \nparties.\" (D.I. 107-7, Ex. 7, 115 (citing Art. 3 Rome I Regulation , margin no. 52)). Dr. \n11 Philipp Dromann, who submitted a declaration on behalf of Calpam, does not respond to \nthis point. (See D.I. 101-3, Ex. 3; D.I. 108-1, Ex. 1). Because Dr. Kammel is the only \nGerman attorney to opine on the applicability of Germany 's conflict-of-law rules, I will \naccept his declaration and apply these mandatory rules. \nDr. Kammel explains that under German conflict-of-law rules, \"Interests in \nproperty are governed by the law of the State in which the property is situated.\" (D.I. \n107-7, Ex. 7, ,r 17 (quoting English translation of Article 43 para 1 of the Introductory \nAct to the German Civil Code)). The Vessel was seized in Delaware and the proceeds of \nits sale are in this Court's registry. Thus, under German conflict-of-law rules, Delaware \nlaw governs the rights in rem to the Vessel and its proceeds . \nUnder Delaware 's Uniform Commercial Code, which applies to transactions in \ngoods (such as bunkers), \"Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) \nin goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a \nsecurity interest.\" DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, \u00a7 2-401(1). In other words, once the goods \nhave been delivered to the buyer, any retention-of-title provision only allows the seller to \nclaim a security interest in the goods. In re Aleris Int'!, Inc., 456 B.R. 35, 42 (Bankr. D. \nDel. 2011 ). Thus, Calpam simply has a security interest in the bunkers, which is junior \nto BOA's mortgage. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31326(b). \nCalpam also argues that to the extent that the Vessel consumed the bunkers before \nits interlocutory sale at auction (D.I. 68), the Vessel committed the tort of conversion by \nappropriating property that belonged to Calpam. Under the U.S. Ship Mortgage Act, the \nconversion of property gives rise to a preferred maritime lien which has priority over a \n12 preferred mortgage lien (like BOA's). 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 31301(5)(8), 31326(b)(l). \nCalpam's argument fails, however, because Calpam did not retain title to the bunkers \nunder Delaware law-it only retained a security interest in the bunkers. \nEven if Calpam were to have retained title to the bunkers, I do not think it would \nhave had a valid maritime conversion claim due to any consumption of the bunkers. See, \ne.g., ING Bank NV v. M/VTemara , 203 F. Supp. 3d 355, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (rejecting \na similar trespass/conversion argument because \"there was nothing wrongful or \nunauthorized in the [buyer's] exercise of dominion or control over the fuel oil. In \nconsuming the fuel oil, [the buyer] did what [the seller] expected it to do.\" (internal \ncitation omitted)). \nThus, BOA's mortgage is superior to Calpam's and Atlas's maritime liens. \nBecause BOA's claim-$16 ,198,373.58 plus interest (D.1. 99)-is greater than its credit \nbid-$6.5 million (D.1. 68)-BOA is entitled to the full return of its deposits now in the \nCourt's registry. \nII.
