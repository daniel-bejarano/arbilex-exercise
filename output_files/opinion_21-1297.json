Chapter 11 \nBankr. Case No. 19-12269-CTG \n(Jointly Administered) \nCiv. No. 21-1297-LPS \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n1. Before the Court is the emergency motion for stay pending appeal (D.I. 4) \n(\"Emergency Stay Motion\") filed by appellant The Allar Company (\"Allar\"), which seeks a stay of \nthe Bankruptcy Court's Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Confirming the Sixth \nAmended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization for MTE Holdings LLC and its Affiliated \nDebtors (B.D.I. 2590) (the \"Confirmation Order\")' pending Allar's appeal of the Bankruptcy \nCourt's ruling (\"Ruling\") overruling Allar's objection to confirmation of the plan of reorganization . \nHaving considered Allar's supplement (D.I. 7), the responses to the Emergency Stay Motion (D.I. \n10, 12), and Allar's reply in further support (D.I. 14), the Court will deny the Emergency Stay \nMotion (D.I. 4), for the reasons set forth herein. \n2. Background. On October 22, 2019, MTE Holdings LLC (\"MTE\") filed a voluntary \npetition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Certain ofMTE's affiliates (together \nwith MTE, the \"Debtors\") filed voluntary petitions thereafter . \n1 The docket of the Chapter 11 cases, captioned In re MTE Holdings LLC, Case No. 19-12269-CTG \n(Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"B.D.I. _.\" 3. The Debtors are parties to various mineral rights leases that authorize them to drill \nfor oil and gas in exchange for the payment of royalties on the oil and gas they extract from the \nland. Certain of the lessors, known as \"interest holders,\" filed proofs of claim, alleging that they \nwere owed amounts for royalties that were due and owing as of the petition date. \n4. On July 9, 2021, Debtors objected to certain proofs of claim (B.D.I. 2334) (\"Claim \nObjection\") filed by the interest holders. The interest holders asserted that, under Texas law, their \nclaims for unpaid prepetition royalties were secured by the proceeds of the oil and gas that the \ndebtors sold. The Debtors generally did not dispute that they owed the interest holders unpaid \nroyalties, but they disagreed with the interest holders that those claims were secured. \n5. On August 18, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a Memorandum Opinion rejecting \nthe position of the interest holders. See In re MTE Holdings LLC, 2021 WL 3668222 (Bankr. D. \nDel. Aug. 18, 2021) (the \"Opinion\") . As the Bankruptcy Court explained, the parties' dispute \nturned on a question of law-the meaning of Texas Business and Commerce Code\u00a7 9.343 -a non\u00ad\nuniform provision of the Unifom1 Commercial Code enacted by the Texas legislature to protect the \nrights of interest owners. The Bankruptc y Court concluded that the interest holders' claims were \nunsecured because the language of that statute did not create a security interest covering the claims \nthat the interest holders actually held. In the absence of case law from the Texas courts offering a \ndefinitive construction of that provision, the Bankmptcy Court concluded that the language of the \nstatute creates a lien only to secure the purchase price of produced oil and gas. Because an operator \ndoes not pay the royalty interest holder for produced oil and gas ( except in certain circumstances \nnot shown to be present here), the Bankruptc y Court held that the holders of royalty interests did not \nhold claims that were secured by operation of\u00a7 9.343. While the Bankruptcy Court acknowledged \nthat this construction created the anomalous circumstance in which a statute intended to protect the \nholder of royalties did not (at least on these facts) accomplish that purpose, the Bankruptc y Court's \n2 reading of the existing statute was reinforced by a subsequent statutory amendment (which became \neffective on September 1, 2021, after the events at issue here) that would solve the \"problem\" \ncreated by the statutory language . \n6. The chapter 11 cases have been complex and contentious. The Debtors proposed \ntheir sixth amended plan ofreorganization on September 3, 2021. (B.D.I. 2588-1) (\"Plan\") The \nPlan contemplated a sale of substantially all of the Debtors' assets to Maple Energy Holdings , LLC \n(the \"Buyer\"). \n7. Allar was not a party to the claim dispute that gave rise to the Opinion holding that \nthose who are owed unpaid royalties are unsecured creditors. Allar did, however, object to \nconfirmation of the Debtors' plan ofreorganization. ( B.D.I. 2457) In its objection , Allar made two \narguments. First, Allar argued that, under Texas law, royalty owners retain an ownership interest in \nthe share of production attributable to their royalty interest. (Id. at 5-6) Second, Allar argued that \nthe claims for unpaid royalties are secured claims, so the Plan violates the \"absolute priority rule\" \nby not allowing royalty owners, such as Allar, priority as a secured creditor to receive proceeds of \noil and gas sales. (Id. at 7) By the time of the confirmation hearing, however, the second point had \nbeen rejected by the Bankruptcy Court in the Opinion. \n8. In evaluating Allar's subsequent motion for stay pending appeal filed below, the \nBankruptcy Court noted that Allar' s ownership argument differs slightly from the issue of law \ndecided the in Opinion: Allar argues not that it is a creditor whose claim for unpaid royalties is \nsecured by the production or its proceeds, but rather that the production is actually owned by Allar -\nand, presumably, that any proceeds would be held in a resulting trust for Allar' s benefit. See In re \nMJ'E Holdings LLC, 2021 WL 4203339 (Bankr. D. Del. Sept. 15, 2021) (\"Stay Opinion\"). \"To \nprevail on that argument , however,\" the Bankruptc y Court noted, Allar was \"required to present \n3 evidence -namely, a factual showing that the assets that the debtors intend to sell includes \nproduction or its proceeds that can be traced to Allar's share.\" Id. at *2. \n9. On September 2-3, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing to consider \nconfirmation of the plan. (See D.I. 14-1 (\"9/2/2021 Tr.\"); D.I. 14-2 (\"9/3/2021 Tr.\")) At the \nconfirmation hearing, the Bankruptcy Court admitted into evidence the declaration of Scott Davido, \nthe Debtors' Chief Restructuring Officer, that set forth the factual record in support of plan \nconfirmation . Although Davido testified live at the confirmation hearing and was available for \ncross-examination (9/2/2021 Tr. at 13-38), Allar elected not to cross examine him (see id. at 38). \n10. While Allar attached certain materials to its brief in opposition to confirmation , it \ndeclined to seek to introduce any of those materials into the evidentiary record at the confirmation \nhearing. Indeed, after the Bankruptcy Court received \"no audible response \" to the question \"[i]s \nthere any other party ... that wishes to present evidence in connection with the confirmation \nhearing\" (id. at 52), the Bankruptcy Court went so far as to point out that the royalty interest holders \nhad not sought to present any evidence to back their opposition to confirmation: \nTHE COURT: So I did obviously see there were a number of interest \nholders that submitted witness lists and the like. And just to be clear, \nnone of that is -that's all required to be submitted in order to give \nfolks the opportunity to present it into evidence , but it's not admitted \ninto evidence in the absence of a party moving it into evidence during \nthe proceeding. So it's obviously up to the parties whether they wish \nto or not. \nBut let me ask the question one more time to see if there's any other \nparty that wishes to present evidence in opposition to confirmation of \nthe plan. \n(No audible response). \n(Id. at 53) When none of the royalty interest holders (many of which filed oppositions to \nconfirmation) rose to be heard in opposition to plan confirmation, the Bankruptcy Court asked \nwhether \"the silence I'm hearing [is] a decision to rest on the papers, or are the interest holders no \n4 longer asserting these objections? \" (Id. at 95) Counsel for Allar responded that they were resting \non their pleadings: \"[T]hat's what we're doing, resting on the pleadings, Judge.\" (Id. at 97) \n11. When the confirmation hearing continued the following day, the Bankruptcy Court \noverruled Allar' s objection, as well as those of several other holders ofroyalty interests. (9/3/2021 \nTr. at 48-52) In doing so, the Bankruptcy Court noted the \"royalty claimant holders were each \ngiven the opportunity to present evidence in support of their objections and to advance argument in \n[support of] their objections. They've all declined to do so and elected to rest on the objections they \nfiled.\" (Id. at 49) The Bankruptcy Court observed , thus, \"there is no evidence in the record in \nsupport of any of those objections. \" (Id.) As \"a matter oflaw, there is nothing in those pleadings \nthat provides [a reason why] this plan cannot be confirmed. \" (Id.) \n12. The Bankruptcy Court described its prior ruling that the interest holders do not hold \nsecured claims and addressed the argument that any unpaid royalties are not property of the estate \nas \"the flip side of the coin from the argument that those creditors hold a security interest in certain \nproceeds and, thus, are secured claims.\" (Id. at 51) The Bankruptcy Court, accordingly, indicated \nthat it would confirm the plan and enter the Confirmation Order. \n13. In order to avoid a circumstance in which a party is required to demand that an \nappellate court rule immediately on a motion for a stay, the Bankruptcy Rules provide that \"[a]n \norder confirming a plan is stayed until the expiration of 14 days after the entry of the order, unless \nthe court orders otherwise.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3020(e). Aware that the proposed confirmation \norder contained language (in paragraph 72) that might shorten the 14-day stay provided by the rule, \nthe Bankruptcy Court pointed this out and gave any and all parties the opportunity to object to the \nwaiver language. (See 9/3/2021 Tr. at 59) The transcript reflects that there was no response. (See \nid.) On September 3, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order. \n5 14. Notwithstanding that September 17, 2021 was the deadline for the confirmed plan to \ngo effective, Allar waited eleven days after the entry of the Confirmation Order -until September \n14, 2021 -to seek a stay pending appeal of the Confirmation Order and the Ruling. (B.D.I. 2619) \nThe Bankruptcy Court held an emergency hearing on Allar' s motion for stay pending appeal and, \non September 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued the Stay Opinion, denying it. The Bankruptcy \nCourt found, among other things, that Allar' s failure to introduce any evidence in support of its \nobjection to confirmation was fatal to Allar's effort to show a likelihood of success on the merits. \n(Stay Opinion at *4) \n15. On September 17, 2021, the Debtors filed the Notice of Occurrence of Effective Date \nof (I) Sixth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization for MI'E Holdings LLC and its \nAffiliated Debtors; and (II) Bar Dates for Certain Claims (the \"Effective Date Notice\"). (See D.I. \n10-1; B.D.I. 2636) As noted in the Effective Date Notice, the Plan became effective and was \nsubstantially consummated on September 17, 2021 (the \"Effective Date\"). (Id.) Pursuant to the \nterms of the Plan, on the Effective Date, the sale of substantially all of the Debtors' assets to Maple \nEnergy Holdings, LLC (the \"Buyer\") closed and most of the proceeds and remaining assets of the \nDebtors were transferred to the certain secured creditors, the MTE Litigation Trust, and the MDC \nLitigation Trust (collectively, the \"Litigation Trusts\"). Any remaining assets not transferred to \nthose creditors and the Litigation Trusts (i.e., a professional fee reserve to pay fees as required by \nthe Plan, amounts reserved to fund a wind down budget created pursuant to the Plan and \nConfirmation Order, and an interest in certain amounts placed in escrow pursuant to the Asset \nPurchase Agreement with the Buyer, which are reserved for the Debtors' secured creditors once the \nfunds come out of escrow) vested in the plan administrator (the \"Plan Administrator\") on the \nEffective Date, free and clear of all liens, claims, charges, or other encumbrances. (See \nConfirmation Order ,r 27; Plan, Article IV .H.1) \n6 16. That same day -but after the Effective Date Notice was filed-Allar filed the \npending Emergency Stay Motion, seeking a stay of distributions under the Confirmation Order,2 \neven though the Plan had already become effective and distributions had already been made. (See \n9/17/2021 Tr. at 7) The Emergency Stay Motion is fully briefed. (D.I. 4, 7, 10, 12, 15). \n17. Jurisdiction. Appeals from the Bankruptcy Court to this Court are governed by 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 158. District courts have mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals \"from final judgments , \norders, and decrees.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(l) . The Confirmation Order is a final order. \n18. Applicable standard. \"The granting of a motion for stay pending appeal is \ndiscretionary with the court.\" In re Trans World Airlines, Inc., 2001 WL 1820325, at *2-3 (Bankr. \nD. Del. Mar. 27, 2001). When faced with such a motion, the Court must evaluate: (1) whether the \nmovant has made \"a strong showing\" that it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the \nmovant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially injure other \ninterested parties; and (4) where the public interest lies. See Republic of Philippines v. \nWestinghouse Electric Corp., 949 F.2d 653,658 (3d Cir. 1991). The most critical factors, \naccording to the Supreme Court, are the first two: whether the stay movant has demonstrated (1) a \nstrong showing of the likelihood of success, and (2) that it will suffer irreparable harm , that is, harm \nthat cannot be prevented or fully rectified by a successful appeal. See In re Revel AC, Inc., 802 F.3d \n558, 568 (3d Cir. 2015) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009)). The Court's analysis \nshould proceed as follows: \nDid the applicant make a sufficient showing that (a) it can win on the \nmerits (significantly better than negligible but not greater than 50%) \nand (b) [it] will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay? If it has, we \nbalance the relative harms considering all four factors using a 'sliding \nscale' approach . However , if the movant does not make the requisite \nshowings on either of these first two factors, the inquiry into the \n2 The Emergency Stay Motion is not entirely clear as to what Allar is seeking to stay, but the Court \nassumes the relief requested is the same as Allar requested in its motion for stay pending appeal \nfiled in the Bankruptcy Court. \n7 balance of harms and the public interest is unnecessary, and the stay \nshould be denied without further analysis. \nRevel AC, 802 F.3d at 571 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n19. Likelihood of success on the merits. As to the first factor, the movant must \ndemonstrate \"a reasonable chance, or probability, of winning.\" Id. The gist of Allar's argument on \nthis element of the analysis is that the Bankruptcy Court was wrong to treat Allar' s \"property of the \nestate\" argument as subsumed within the Bankruptcy Court's prior holding that royalty interest \nholders' claims are unsecured. (B.D.I. 2619 at 3-4; D.I. 4 at 7-9) While the Bankruptcy Court \nviewed these points as related, it also credited, for purposes of the stay motion, Allar' s contention \nthat issues may be viewed as analytically distinct rather than just \"the flip side of the coin.\" (See \nStay Opinion at *4) The Bankruptc y Court found, however, \"fair room for disagreement\": \nOn the one hand, Allar does point to caselaw suggesting that, under \nTexas law, a mineral interest is carved out from the grant conveyed to \na lessee under an oil and gas lease. See D.I. 2620 at 5. On the other, \nas the debtors pointed out, the Texas Supreme Court has also \nexplained that where \"an oil and gas lease reserves only a royalty \ninterest, the lessee acquires title to all of the oil and gas in place, and \nthe lessor owns only a possibility of reverter and has the right to \nreceive royalties.\" That would suggest that a royalty holder may \nretain an interest in the lease, but nevertheless hold only a contract \nclaim against the lessee to recover unpaid royalties. \nStay Opinion at *4 (citing Nat. Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Pool, 124 S.W.3d 188, 192 (Tex. 2003)). \n20. But \"even crediting the contestable legal arguments that Allar is making,\" the \nBankruptcy Court noted, Allar failed to present any evidence at the confirmation hearing in support \nof its ownership argument, which \"essentially dooms its likelihood of succeeding on the merits.\" \nId. The Court agrees. Allar' s appeal depends on its assertion that the Debtors lack an equitable \ninterest in the proceeds from the oil and gas sales. Under this line of reasoning, the proceeds \npurportedly owed to Allar from oil and gas production would not be part of the estates and instead \nwould be owned by Allar. But even assuming there is merit to Allar's legal argument, Allar chose \n8 not to present any evidence in support of its argument at the confirmation hearing despite being \ngiven opportunities to do so by the Bankruptcy Court. \n21. Although Allar concedes it failed to offer any evidence at the confirmation hearing, \nit argues nonetheless that its \"evidence was properly before the [Bankruptcy] Court for \nconsideration.\" (D.I. 4 at 7) The Court disagrees . The Bankruptcy Court had no evidence before it \nthat Allar had entered into a lease with the Debtors, had not been paid for royalties that were due, \nand (even arguably) had an ownership interest in certain of the assets that the Debtors claimed as \nproperty of the estate. \n22. Allar further appears to fault the Debtors for not offering certain documents into \nevidence. (See id.) The record reflects that the Debtors moved several declarations into evidence at \nthe confirmation hearing and admitted the direct testimony of their Chief Restructuring Officer, \nScott Davido. See Stay Opinion at *2. Although Allar takes issue with the Debtors not offering the \nAsset Purchase Agreement , the Leases, and the prepetition royalties into evidence (D.I. 4 at 7), \nthere was no requirement that the Debtors do so. The Debtors only had to meet their burden for the \nelements of confirmation ; once they had, as the Bankruptcy Court noted, it was \"Allar's burden to \ndemonstrate that the assets that the debtor seeks to sell to a buyer under its plan is not actually \nproperty of the estate.\" Stay Opinion at *4. \n23. Without any evidence, Allar cannot show that the approximately $1.25 million in \nassets for which it seeks to stay distribution can be traced to royalties payable to Allar and are \nowned by Allar. It appears that Allar also failed establish the amount of unpaid royalties \ncomprising its claim, much less that it has any potential entitlement to $1.25 million.3 \n3 Debtors further argue that Allar is unlikely to succeed on its appeal because the appeal is equitably \nmoot. (See D.I. 10 at 13-15) Allar disagrees . (D.I. 14 at 1) The Court need not resolve whether \nequitable mootness provides another basis to deny Allar's pending motion. \n9 24. Irreparable harm to Allar absent a stay. On the second factor, Allar must show that \nirreparable injury is '\"likely,\"' not merely possible, in the absence of a stay. In re Revel AC, Inc., \n802 F.3d at 569 (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)). Allar \nmust also establish a resulting injury \"that cannot be redressed by a legal or equitable remedy.\" \nInstant Air Freight Co. v. CF. Air Freight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797 , 801 (3d Cir. 1989). \n25. The Emergency Stay Motion asserts that \"[u]sing Allar's property to pay Debtor's \ncreditors violates Allar' s Fifth Amendment rights.\" (D .I. 4 at 19) Allar further asserts that \"the \nroyalties owned by Allar will be lost if a stay is denied because the distributions begin on the \nSeptember 17, 2021 effective date.\" (D.I. 7 at 7) Allar therefore asserts that the stay is necessary \nin order to prevent the plan from going effective -and, thereby, to prevent distributions to creditors. \nThe plan, however, went effective before Allar even filed its Emergency Stay Motion. Wires went \nout, distributions were made. The harm Allar points to, therefore, will happen even with a stay (as \nit had already happened before Allar filed its motion). Moreover, Allar's harm is compensable by \nmonetary damages. \"[A] purely economic injury, compensable in money, cannot satisfy the \nirreparable injury requirement [unless] the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the \nexistence of the movant's business.\" In re Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 572. Allar has not even alleged it \ncan make such showings. \n26. Having failed to satisfy the two most important factors in the stay analysis, the Court \nneed not consider the remaining factors. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \n27. Conclusion. For the reasons set forth herein, the Emergency Stay Motion (D.l. 4) is \nDENIED. \nJanuary 4, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware HOi~i~~ \nUNITED STA TES DISTRJCT JUDGE \n10 "}
