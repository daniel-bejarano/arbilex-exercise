{"case_name": "FinancialApps, LLC v. Envestnet, Inc. et al", "case_number": "19-1337", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "12-12-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nFINANCIALAPPS , LLC \nPlaintiff, \nV. Civil Action No. 19-1337-GBW-CJB \nENVESTNET, Inc. and YODLEE , Inc. \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff FinancialApps , LLC (\"FinApps\") alleges that Defendant Envestnet , Inc. \n(\"Envestnet \") and its subsidiary , Defendant Yodlee, Inc. (\"Yodlee,\" and, collectively , \n\"Defendants \"), caused Yodlee to enter a Software License and Master Services Agreement (DJ. \n2-1, Ex. 1, the \"MSA\") in order to gain access to and misappropriate FinApps' s trade secrets. \nDJ.2111 , 220. The case was and remains referred to Magistrate Judge Christopher J. Burke \n'\"to conduct all proceedings and hear and determine all motions[ .]\"' DJ. 437 (quoting D.I. 18). \nPursuant to Judge Burke's Order of November 1, 2022, DJ. 438, the parties submitted a revised \nproposed scheduling order, DJ. 439-1. In a letter attached thereto, the parties dispute which \nclaims that are brought by and counterclaims that are brought against Y odlee should be tried to a \njury, if any. DJ. 439. \nOn January 14, 2021, the Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part a motion by \nDefendants to try this case to a bench trial, rather than a jury trial. DJ. 250 at 10. The Court \nexplained that, while the MSA'sjury trial waiver applied to FinApps's claims against Yodlee, \nthe waiver did not apply to FinApps's claims against Envestnet, since Envestnet was not party to \nthe MSA. DJ. 250 at 7-8. The Court expanded upon its ruling as follows: I have determined that it will be more efficient to first try FinApps 's claims against \nEnvestnet and then hold a bench trial of FinApps's claims against Yodlee. I \nbelieve that efficiencies can be gained by providing the jury a special verdict form \nthat will obtain findings for issues that necessarily must be decided to resolve the \nclaims alleged against both defendants. I will therefore ask the jury, for example, \n( 1) whether the purported trade secrets and other confidential information alleged \nby FinApps to have been misappropriated are legally protectable and (2) whether \nY odlee accessed, stole, misappropriated or otherwise violated any of the trade \nsecrets, confidential information , or other legally protectable information identified \nby FinApps. The jury's answers to these questions could significantly narrow the \nissues that I would have to decide at a later bench trial. \nD.I. 250 at 10 (emphases added). \nThe Complaint in this case, D.I. 2, sounds in 14 counts: Counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 14 are \nbrought against both Envestnet and Yodlee; Counts 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are brought against \nY odlee only; and Count 9 is brought against Envestnet only. The Court has dismissed Counts 6 \nand 9. D.I. 126. FinApps now asks that the Court try to a jury in Phase I counts brought against \nboth Defendants (Counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 14) and Defendants ' joint counterclaim against \nFinApps. D.I. 439-1 ,r I.l(a). Defendants ask that the Court try to ajury Counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and \n14 as brought against Envestnet only, along with Envestnet's counterclaim against FinApps, and \nthat the Court later try those same Counts brought against Yodlee in a bench trial. D.I. 439-1 ,r,r \nI.1 (b ), II.l (b ). \nConsistent with the Court's prior ruling, FinApps's claims against Envestnet-and \nEnvestnet 's counterclaims against FinApps-will be tried to a jury in Phase I. Also, consistent \nwith the Court's prior ruling, the Court will try to a jury \"issues that necessarily must be decided \nto resolve the claims alleged against both defendants. \" D.I. 250 at 10. In Phase II, the Court will \nhold a bench trial on all ofFinApps 's claims against Yodlee and Yodlee's counterclaims against \nFinApps. Thus, the Court accepts Defendants ' proposed language and rejects FinApps's \nproposed language. See D.I. 439-1 ,r,r I.l(b), II.l(b). \n2 The Court anticipates that the parties will have disagreements as to what special verdict \nquestions must also be put to a jury in Phase I. Thus, the Court directs that Paragraph I. 7. of the \nparties' proposed Supplemental Scheduling Order be amended as follows: \n7. Jury Instructions, Voir Dire, and Special Verdict Forms. \n(a) [Insert existing language in Paragraph I.7.] \n(b) No later than sixty ( 60) days before the Pretrial Conference in this case, \nthe parties shall jointly file a special verdict form that lists questions \"that \nnecessarily must be decided to resolve the claims alleged against both \n[D]efendants.\" D.I . 250 at 10. That list shall be referred to the Magistrate Judge \nfor recommendations as to an appropriate list of such questions for the jury and, to \nthe extent necessary , reasons therefore. After the Magistrate Judge issues such \nrecommendations , the parties shall have seven (7) days to each separately file \nobjections , not to exceed three (3) single-spaced pages, to such recommendations. \nThe parties shall, within seven (7) days, file a revised proposed Supplemental Scheduling \nOrder that is consistent with the Court's ruling. \nWHEREFORE , at Wilmington this 12th day of December , 2022, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that: \n1. The parties shall try all claims brought against and counterclaims brought by Envestnet \nto a jury, and the same jury shall provide findings for issues that necessarily must be \ndecided to resolve the claims alleged against both Envestnet and Yodlee1; \n2. Thereafter , the parties shall try in a bench trial all claims brought against Y odlee; and \n3. Within seven (7) days of this opinion, the parties shall jointly submit a revised proposed \nSupplement Scheduling Order consistent with this morandum Order. \nGREGORYB. WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n1 During the jury trial, FinApps will be permitted to present evidence regarding those claims that \nrelate to both EnvestrJet and Y odlee, to the extent that evidence involves \"issues that necessaril y \nmust be decided to resolve the claims alleged against both defendants. \" \n3 "}
