Attorney for Respondent. \nAugust 12, 2014 \nWilmington, Delaware ~~~.rv \nSTARK, U.S. District Judge: \nI. INTRODUCTION1 \nWilliam A. Phillips (\"Movant\") filed a timely Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct \nSentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2255. (D.I. 73; D.I. 79) The United States (\"Respondent\") filed \nan Answer in Opposition. (D.I. 81) For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny Movant's \u00a7 2255 \nMotion without holding an evidentiary hearing. \n11. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nOn or about January 14, 2001, while living in Elkton, Maryland, Movant recorded a \nseventeen-minute child pornography video depicting Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II. (D.I. 81 at 2) \nMovant used a VHS camera to record them and sometime afterwards re-recorded the video tape to \na compact disk (CD). Movant did not copy his child pornography video of Jane Doe #1 and Jane \nDoe #2 to his computer hard drive. Id. \nOn July 30, 2007, a detective from the New Castle County Police Department (\"NCCPD\") \nconducted a child pornography investigation of unknown targets from NCCPD Headquarters using \nthe \"Peer-2-Peer\" (\"P2P\") file sharing network. (D.I. 81 at 2) The detective's search led to \nMovant's computer at this New Castle home. (Id. at 3) Movant's computer was on the P2P \nnetwork, and the detective was able to browse the titles of Movant's shared files, many of which \nwere indicative of child pornography. While browsing Movant's shared directory, the detective was \n1Movant was originally charged with offenses in two separate criminal cases that originated from the \nsame set of facts: Cr. A. No. 08-31 and Cr. A. No. 09-26. Although the cases were not consolidated, \nMovant signed a single Memorandum of Plea Agreement covering both cases. (D.I. 47) In tum, \nthe Court conducted one sentencing hearing for both cases (D.I. 67), and the Court of Appeals \nissued one appellate decision for both cases, see Phillips v. United States, 396 F. App'x 831 (3d Cir. \n2010). Thus, although Movant filed two separate but identical\u00a7 2255 Motions in his two criminal \ncases, this Court will render one decision for both \u00a7 2255 Motions and docket the decision in each \ncase. Unless otherwise stated, all docket index citations are to Criminal Action No. 08-31-LPS. \n1 able to capture the SHA 1 hash values (digital fingerprints) associated with known child pornography \nfiles. (Id.) \nOn several occasions from July 31, 2007 through September 11, 2007, the detective browsed \nMovant's shared directory, each time finding that the directory held approximately 200 computer \nfiles. (D.l. 81 at 3) Through SHA1 hash values, the detective identified from among those files the \ndigital fingerprints of known child pornography. (Id.) \nOn September 19, 2007, the detective executed a state issued search warrant at Movant's \nNew Castle home. (D.I. 81at3) NCCPD officers seized Movant's computer with hard drive, 131 \nCDs, and the Kodak digital camera with memory card. The computer and CDs were taken from the \nhouse for an off-the-premises examination. (Id.) Movant was arrested the same day as the search of \nhis home, and he did not make a post-arrest statement. (Id. at 4) \nLater, the NCCPD detectives completed forensic examination of Movant's computer hard \ndrive and discovered that it was virtually filled to capacity with photo images and videos. (D.I. 81 at \n3 n.4) Approximately ninety percent of that material constituted child pornography, with \napproximately one-half of the child porn depicting pre-pubescent children engaged in the lascivious \nexhibition of the genitals and hard core sex acts. Movant's hard drive contained more than 100,000 \nphotos and 500 videos of child pornography, all downloaded from the internet. (Id.) \nOn February 26, 2008, the grand jury returned an eleven-count Indictment, which included \nfour counts of receipt of child pornography by computer (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) & (b)(1)), with \neach count carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years of incarceration and a minimum penalty of \nfive years of incarceration. (D.I. 81 at 4) The remaining portion of the Indictment charged two \ncounts of attempted distribution of child pornography (18 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 2252A(a)(1) & (b)(1)); possession of child pornography (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) & (b)(2)); two \ncounts of attempted distribution of obscenity depicting children (18 U.S.C. \n2 \u00a7 1446A(a)(2)(A) & (B); \u00a7 2252A(b)(1)); receipt of obscenity depicting children (18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1446A(a)(2)(A) & (B)); and possession of obscenity depicting children (18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1446A(b)(2)(A) & (B); \u00a7 2252A(b)(2)). (Id. at n.6, n.7) Although all of the numerous images and \nvideos of child pornography found on Movant's computer hard drive had been downloaded by him \noff of the internet, Respondent included in the Indictment just four specific instances of such \nreceipt. \nOn June 4, 2008, approximately three months after the Indictment was returned, the \nNCCPD detective examined Movant's CDs, which included the approximately twenty CDs \ncontaining the child pornographic images Movant had recorded of Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II. \n(D.I. 81 at 5) In the background of the child pornography images of Jane Doe I, the detective \nrecognized Movant's New Castle house, specifically, his bedroom and its furnishings, which the \ndetective had observed during the search of the house. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") \njoined the investigation soon thereafter. (Id.) \nOn June 16, 2008, FBI agents obtained a search warrant from this Court for Movant's \nhouse. (D.I. 81 at 5) The next day investigators executed the warrant and seized from Movant's \nbedroom the furniture and objects depicted in the relevant photographs of Jane Doe I. (Id.) \nOn June 24, 2008, the grand jury returned a thirty-six count Superseding Indictment against \nMovant, charging him with numerous child pornography related offenses, including several counts \nof inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct and crossing a state line to engage in a \nsexual act with a minor. (D.I. 20; D.I. 23; see also Phzllips, 396 F. App'x 831, 832 (3d Cir. 2010)) On \nMarch 31, 2009, Movant pled guilty to Count Sixteen of the Superseding Indictment, which charged \nhim with production of child pornography, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). (D.l. 47) Pursuant to \nthe Plea Agreement, Movant also entered a guilty plea to a one-count Information charging him \nwith possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2) as \n3 charged in Criminal Action No. 09-36-LPS. (D.I. 47 in Cr. A. No. 08-31; D.I. 3 in Cr. A. No. 09-36) \nOn February 10, 2009, the Honorable Joseph J. Farnan, Jr. sentenced Movant to 360 months \nimprisonment on Count Sixteen of the Superseding Indictment in Cr. A. No. 08-31, and to 120 \nmonths imprisonment on Count One of the Felony Information in Cr. A. No. 09-36, with the \nsentences to run concurrently with one another. (D.l. 65) \nMovant appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed his \nconviction on October 7, 2010. See Phillips, 396 F. App'x. at 835. Movant did not seek certiorari \nreview. \nIn October 2011, Movant filed the pending\u00a7 2255 Motion. (D.l. 73) The case was then re-\nassigned to the undersigned's docket. Respondent filed a Reply in Opposition. (D.I. 81) \nIII. DISCUSSION \nMovant timely filed his pro se \u00a7 2255 Motion, asserting seven claims that counsel provided \nineffective assistance with respect to the plea process and appeal stage.2 (D.I. 73; D.I. 79) \nRespondent contends that the claims should be denied as meritless. \nMovant has properly raised his ineffective assistance of counsel allegations in a \u00a7 2255 \nmotion. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500 (2003). As a general rule, ineffective assistance of \ncounsel claims are reviewed pursuant to the two-pronged standard established in Strick/and v. \nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Under the first Strickland prong, Movant must demonstrate that \n\"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" with reasonableness \nbeing judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance. Id. \n2Movant's original form\u00a7 2255 motion asserts one ineffective assistance of counsel claim with five \nsub-arguments, and one claim asserting a violation of the Tenth Amendment. (D.l. 73) However, \nMovant subsequently filed a letter amending that Motion to assert seven ineffective assistance of \ncounsel allegations, one of which is based on his former Tenth Amendment argument. (D.l. 79) \nThus, the Court construes the Motion as asserting seven ineffective assistance of counsel claims. \n4 Under the second Strickland prong, Movant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for \ncounsel's error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. See id. at 694; United \nStates v. Nahodil, 36 F.3d 323, 326 (3d Cir. 1994). In the context of a guilty plea, a Movant lsatisfies \nStrick/ands prejudice prong by demonstrating that, but for counsel's error, there is a reasonable \nprobability that he would have insisted on proceeding to trial instead of pleading guilty. See Hill v. \nLockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). A court can choose to address the prejudice prong before the \ndeficient performance prong, and may reject an ineffectiveness claim solely on the ground that the \ndefendant was not prejudiced. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668. Finally, although not insurmountable, \nthe Strickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a strong presumption that counsel's \nrepresentation was professionally reasonable. Id. at 689. \nA. Claim One: Counsel's Failure To Communicate Initial Plea Offer \nIn his first claim, Movant contends that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing \nto tell him of an \"early plea offered by the Government for a twenty year max sentence until after \nthe plea was signed.\" (D.I. 73 at 3; D.I. 79 at 1) The facts surrounding this allegation \nare as follows. On April 3, 2008, Respondent forwarded to defense counsel a Memorandum of Plea \nAgreement with a cover letter. (D.I. 81 at A-1 to A-5) The plea offer was to Count Three of the \nIndictment, charging receipt of child pornography by computer, and carried a maximum penalty of \ntwenty years of incarceration and a minimum penalty of five years of incarceration. Respondent's \ncover letter to defense counsel stated that the \"offer will be revoked if not accepted by Monday, \nApril 14, 2008. Please contact me if that deadline does not give you enough time to meet with your \nclient.\" (D.I. 81 at A-1) The plea offer lapsed without defense counsel requesting an extension of \nthe April 14, 2008 deadline. \nOn or about June 4, 2008, approximately two months after the lapse of the plea offer, the \nNCCPD detective discovered the child pornography images of Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II on \n5 twenty of the 141 CDs that had been taken from Movant's house on September 19, 2007. (D.I. 81 \nat 5) This discovery eventually led to the involvement of the FBI and the return of the thirty-six \ncount Superseding Indictment charging Movant with numerous child pornography related offenses. \n(Id.; see also D.I. 23) Movant pled guilty to an offer that carried a maximum sentence of forty years \nof incarceration, and the Court imposed a sentence of thirty years of incarceration. (D.I. 47; D.I. \n65; D.I. 71) \nRecently, in Missouri v. Frye, the United States Supreme Court opined that \"defense counsel \nhas the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and \nconditions that may be favorable to the accused.\" Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1408 (2012). \nConsequently, defense counsel's performance is deficient if he allows a formal \"offer to expire \nwithout advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it.\" Id. \nPursuant to Frye and its companion case, Lefler v. Cooper, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1385 (2012), a \ndefendant establishes \"prejudice from ineffective assistance of counsel where a plea offer has lapsed \nor been rejected because of counsel's deficient performance\" by demonstrating the following \nfactors: (1) a reasonable probability that he \"would have accepted the earlier plea offer had [he] been \nafforded effective assistance of counsel;\" (2) a reasonable probability that the prosecution would not \nhave withdrawn the offer in light of intervening circumstances; (3) the trial court would have \naccepted the plea agreement; and ( 4) a reasonable probability \"that the end result of the criminal \nprocess would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less \nprison time.\" Frye, 132 S.Ct at 1409-11; see also Lafler, 132 S.Ct. at 1385. In Frye, the issue of \nintervening circumstances arose because Frye committed a new offense of driving without a license \nafter the initial plea offer. The Frye Court noted that this new offense provided a \"reason to doubt \nthat the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have \naccepted it ... unless they were required by state law to do so,\" and then concluded that there \n6 would be no Strickland prejudice if Frye failed to \"show a reasonable probability the prosecutor \nwould have adhered to the [original plea] agreement.\" Id. at 1411. \nAfter reviewing Movant's instant argument within the framework established by Frye and \nLafler, the Court concludes that Movant has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by \ncounsel's failure to communicate the initial plea offer. First, Movant does not assert that he would \nhave accepted the initial plea offer if it had been timely communicated to him by counsel. Second, \nthe June 4, 2008 discovery of the child pornography in the twenty CDs of the minor victims \nconstituted an intervening circumstance that resulted in the Superseding Indictment charging \nMovant with production of child pornography. Because production of child pornography is a more \nserious offense than the original offense of receipt of child pornography, Movant cannot \ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that Respondent would not have withdrawn the initial plea \noffer after discovering the intervening circumstances. Consequently, Movant cannot demonstrate a \nreasonable probability that the initial plea offer would have been presented to the Court,3 which, in \ntum, means that he cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal \nprocess would have been more favorable but for counsel's failure to communicate the initial plea \noffer. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Movant's first allegation of ineffective assistance is \nmeritless. \n3 Additionally, during the sentencing hearing, Judge Farnan characterized the intervening \ncircumstances involving Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II as \"horrendous.\" Judge Farnan expressed \nconcern about additional issues involving the conduct displayed in the photographs, as well as the \nlack of state prosecution for that conduct. (D.I. 67 at 35) Given these circumstances, Movant \ncannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the Court would have accepted the initial plea \noffer even had it been presented to the Court. \n7 B. Claim Two: Counsel's Inadequate Representation During Sentencing \nOn November 18, 2009, Movant was sentenced to 360 months imprisonment for \nproduction of child pornography and possession of child pornography. (D.I. 65) Movant contends \nthat \"counsel didn't sufficiently highlight to the court [his] medical and physical disabilities\" or \nmention the fact that Movant was going through a bad divorce when arguing for a lesser sentence at \nthe sentencing hearing. This argument is unavailing. \nFirst, Movant does not specify the psychological, medical, and physical disabilities defense \ncounsel failed to highlight. Second, prior to sentencing, defense counsel arranged for a complete \nmental health evaluation of Movant. The results of the evaluation were detailed in the presentence \nreport, and the sentencing transcript demonstrates that Judge Farnan considered those results in \ndetermining Movant's sentence. (D.I. 67 at 31) Finally, and most importantly, defense counsel \naddressed Movant's mental history and condition with specificity during the sentencing hearing. \n(D.I. 67 at 11-12) For instance, counsel stated, \nI point out, and the evidence -testing bares this out, that through absolutely no fault of his \nown, Mr. Phillips was a mentally and emotionally injured soul from childhood. Lifetime \nsymptoms included depression, anxiety, social fears, sleep disorders, nervousness, and low, \nor virtually non-existent self-esteem. \n(Id. at 10) Counsel then provided numerous examples of Movant's psychological, medical, and \nphysical disabilities, at one point stating that Movant has been diagnosed with \"depression, bipolar \ndisorder, anxiety, and most recently a major depressive disorder, dysthemic disorder, and an \navoidant personality disorder.\" (Id. at 10-13) Notably, the sentencing transcript reveals that Judge \nFarnan considered Movant's psychological issues and his divorce when determining Movant's \nsentence, as demonstrated by Judge Faman's statement that Movant \nhas experienced bouts of depression and periods of alcohol abuse following a divorce from \nhis wife, the mother of the victim he molested. But he has no other significant history that \ncould explain this disturbing behavior that he engaged in. \n8 (Id. at 41) \nAfter viewing this record in conjunction with Movant's vague complaint, the Court \nconcludes that Movant has failed to demonstrate that counsel's performance fell below an objective \nstandard of reasonableness or a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence \nif counsel had \"sufficiently\" highlighted Movant's psychological issues and difficult divorce. As \nsuch, the Court will deny Claim Two as meritless. \nC. Claim Three: Counsel's Status As A Parent \nNext, Movant argues that his \"lawyer was unable to represent [him] effectively because of \nhis young children\" and the fact that the charges were all related to child pornography. (D.I. 73 at 3) \nMovant offers no evidence of how counsel's status as the father of young children prevented \ncounsel from effectively representing him. As such, the Court will deny this contention as meritless. \nD. Claim Four: Counsel's Failure To Challenge Interstate Commerce Element \nMovant contends that counsel was ineffective for telling him that he \"couldn't contest the \nproduction [of child pornography] charge even though it didn't involve interstate commerce.\" (D.I. \n73 at 3) In his amendment, Movant asserts that counsel \"didn't investigate that there was no \ninterstate commerce involved in the crime and that the state had to prove [there] was.\" (D.I. 79) \nViewed together, these statements appear to allege that counsel was ineffective for failing to argue \nthat Respondent had to prove the visual depictions were actually transported to another state in \norder for him to be convicted of production of child pornography. For the following reasons, the \nCourt concludes that this argument lacks merit. \nIn this case, Movant was charged with production of child pornography pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2251 (a), which reads, in pertinent part: \nAny person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces, any minor to engage \nin ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such \nconduct ... shall be punished as provided under section (e), ... if that visual depiction was \n9 produced using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in or affecting \ninterstate or foreign commerce by any means .... \nIn turn, Count Sixteen of the Superseding Indictment, charged that \nOn or about [November 1, 2003, through on or about September 13, 2004], in the District \nof Delaware, William A. Phillips, the defendant, did use, persuade, induce, and entice a \nminor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions \nof such conduct, to wit: digital files depicting Jane Doe #1, a female minor, engaged in \nsexually explicit conduct, as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2256(2)(A), \nwhich depictions were produced using materials that had been transported in \ninterstate commerce and foreign commerce to Delaware[.] All in violation of Title 18, \nUnited States Code, Section 2251(a). \n(D.I. 23) (emphasis added) \nThe Third Circuit has consistently recognized that Federal criminal statutes prohibiting intra-\nstate possession of child pornography and the distribution, use, and/ or production of child \npornography are a proper exercise of Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause. See \nUnited States v. MacEwan, 445 F.3d 237, 245-56 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Rodia, 194 F.3d 465, \n478-79 (3d Cir. 1999) (intra-state possession). As such, under the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2251(a), the interstate commerce element for the offense of producing child pornography may be \nsatisfied by proof that the child pornography was produced using materials that had been \ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce; the government need not prove that the visual \ndepictions themselves were transported through interstate commerce. See United S fates v. Cramer, 213 \nF. App'x 138, 141-42 (3d Cir. 2007) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(b)); Rodia, 194 F.3d at 478-79 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)); see also United States v. GrzybowicZ; 747 F.3d 1296, 1306 (11th Cir. 2014). \nIn this case, the materials used by Movant to produce the visual depictions of child \npornography were manufactured outside the State of Delaware and, therefore, had to be transported \nto Delaware in order to be available for Movant's use. These circumstances demonstrate that \nRespondent established the interstate element of\u00a7 2251 (a). Thus, counsel did not provide \n10 ineffective assistance by failing to raise a meritless argument. See United States v. Sanders, 165 F.3d \n248, 253 (3d Cir. 1999). \nThe Court acknowledges that Movant may be attempting to argue that counsel was \nineffective because he failed to adequately advise Movant about the interstate commerce element of \nproduction of child pornography offense to which he pled guilty. This contention is belied by the \nrecord. The Plea Agreement Movant entered into on March 31, 2009 (D.l. 47) defined the interstate \ncommerce element for production of child pornography as \"the visual depiction traveled in \ninterstate or foreign commerce or was produced using materials that had been transported in \ninterstate or foreign commerce.\" (D.I. 47 at 2) Moreover, during the change of plea hearing, the \nissue of the interstate commerce element and how it related to Count Sixteen was specifically \ndiscussed by the Court, defense counsel, and Movant: \nCOURT: In the Plea Agreement it says that there are certain elements -this \nis in paragraph two on page two, that have to be met for you to ever be --to plead guilty, or \nfor you to ever be convicted of this offense. It says that you acted knowingly, that you did \nuse, persuade or induce a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, that is actual or \nsimulated sex acts or the lascivious exhibit.ion of genitals or pubic area, that you for the \npurpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct -that was all for the purpose of \nproducing a visual depiction, and the visual depiction traveled in interstate or foreign \ncommerce, or was produced using materials that have been transported in interstate \nor foreign commerce. Do you understand those are the elements? \nMOV ANT: Yes, your Honor. I took pictures of a child. I realized it was wrong. \nCOURT: You don't contest the part about interstate commerce or foreign \ncommerce, in other words, either the visual depiction that you produced or the materials \nused to produce it, traveled in interstate commerce? That means they went across a \nstate border. \nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, may I just clarify? The way it's been \nexplained to Mr. Phillips is that the materials used to produce those images were \ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce, not that the depictions themselves had \nbeen transported in interstate or foreign commerce. \nCOURT: You understand that? \nMOV ANT: Yes. \n11 * * * \nCOURT: I'm going to ask the prosecutor to tell me what evidence the \ngovernment has that they would be prepared to use against you both as to the Information \nCount and the Indictment Count. I'll ask you to listen carefully, because at the end I'm \ngoing to ask you if you contest any of that evidence that they are going to proffer to me. \n* * * \nGOVERNMENT: Were the case to go to trial, the government would present \ntestimony from New Castle County Police Department investigators. They would indicate \nthat in August of 2007, they were conducting a child pornography investigation online. \nThey were using a file-sharing program, the investigator would type in search words \nindicative of child pornography, and they found a computer that had child pornography on \nit. Through subpoenas, the investigator ultimately traced that computer to the defendant's \nresidence in New Castle. They executed a search warrant on September the 19t\\ 2007, \nat the defendant's New Castle residence and they found a Hewlett Packard computer, a \nKodak DC 3200 digital camera and they also found in excess of 20 CD's. All of that \nequipment was manufactured outside of the State of Delaware. \n* * * \nThen a computer forensic examination was later conducted by the New Castle County \nPolice Department, and the investigator found more than 500 images, 500 videos of child \npornography and more than 100,000 images -picture images of child pornography. \n* * * \nTogether with the computer, as I said, there was in excess of 20 CDs that were found. \nWhen the investigators went to the CDs, they found approximately 15 to 20 CDs of child \npornography, but they [] recognized the child, Jane Doe I from the pictures as well. \n* * * \nAmong these CDs of Jane Doe were several hundred pictures including pictures where Jane \nDoe is depicted in a lascivious exhibit of the genitals and the pubic area and also engaged in \nsex acts. The investigator was able to determine from the forensic evidence that the image \nwas taken with a Kodak DC 3200 digital camera, same type of camera that was taken from \nMr. Phillip's residence. The investigator concluded that the images had been taken with that \nKodak camera transferred into the Hewlett Packard computer, again, which is also \nmanufactured outside of Delaware and then downloaded on to the CD's, also \nmanufactured outside of the State of Delaware. \n(D.I. 71at9-16) (emphasis added) \n12 \"Solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity\" that creates a \n\"formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings.\" Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 7 4 \n(1977). A plain reading of the change of plea hearing transcript indicates that Movant's counsel and \nthe Court fully explained to him the nature of the interstate commerce element, and the Court \naccepted Movant's representation that he understood. Movant does not dispute the record of his \nplea colloquy, nor does Movant offer any additional facts that contradict it. Thus, Movant's \nunsupported allegations in this proceeding fail to provide compelling evidence as to why the \nstatements he made during the plea colloquy regarding his understanding of the interstate commerce \nelement of his offense and his satisfaction with counsel's performance should not be presumptively \naccepted as true. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Four because it lacks merit. \nF. Claim Five: Counsel's Failure To Assert Issue Of State Sovereignty \nIn his next claim, Movant cites to Bond v. United States, 131 S.Ct. 2355 (2011), and argues that \nthe Federal government violated his Tenth Amendment rights by interfering with the \"sovereignty \nof the state.\" (D.I. 73 at 4-5; D.I. 79 at 1) Movant also contends that Respondent lacked probable \ncause to take the case from state jurisdiction. (D.I. 73 at 4-5; D.I. 79 at 1) Although not entirely \nclear, Movant appears to assert two related Tenth Amendment arguments in Claim Five: (1) counsel \nshould have argued that Congress lacked authority to enact the child pornography statutes under \nwhich he was convicted (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)); and (2) the \nFederal government did not have the authority to investigate him and prosecute him in Federal \ncourt. Both of these arguments lack merit. \nAs an initial matter, aside from establishing Movant's standing to raise a Tenth Amendment \nchallenge, Bond is unrelated to Movant's case and does not provide any substantive support for the \ncontentions in Claim Five. In Bond, the Supreme Court held that an individual indicted for violating \n13 a federal statute may \"challenge its validity on grounds that, by enacting it, Congress exceeded its \npowers under the [Tenth Amendment of the] Constitution, thus intruding upon the sovereignty and \nauthority of the States.\" Bond, 131 S.Ct. at 2360. However, the Bond Court explicitly refrained from \nexpressing a view on the merits of the Tenth Amendment argument raised by the defendant. See id \nat 2367. Therefore, Movant's reliance on Bond does not support his ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. \nThe Court also concludes that Movant's two underlying Tenth Amendment arguments lack \nmerit. The Third Circuit has consistently recognized the Federal child pornography statutes as valid \nexercises of Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause. See Cramer, 213 F. App'x at 141-\n42; MacEwan, 445 F.3d at 245-56; Rodia, 194 F.3d at 478-79. Therefore, even if counsel had argued \nthat the Federal child pornography statutes at issue in this case were enacted in violation of the \nTenth Amendment, this constitutional challenge would have been futile. As such, counsel did not \nprovide ineffective assistance by failing to raise this meritless argument. See 1Sanders, 165 F.3d at \n253. \nMovant's second contention -that counsel should have challenged Respondent's \nprosecution of him in federal court as violating Delaware's sovereign right under the Tenth \nAmendment to have exclusive criminal jurisdiction over any proceedings against him -is similarly \nunavailing. There was no Tenth Amendment violation. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, the \"district \ncourts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all \noffenses against the laws of the United States.\" As just explained, Congress criminalized the \npossession of child pornography by its authority under the Commerce Clause. Movant's indictment \ncharged him with violating two Federal child pornography statutes. Consequently, the Court \npossessed jurisdiction over Movant's case. Thus, defense counsel did not provide ineffective \nassistance by failing to raise this meritless argument. See Sanders, 165 F.3d at 253. \n14 Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Five as meritless. \nG. Claim Six: Counsel's Failure To Challenge Search Warrants \nIn his amendment, Movant states that \"[counsel] didn't argue enough about the four times \nthat they tried to receive evidence for a search warrant never received a thing had no just cause to \nreceive a warrant.\" (D.l. 79 at 2) The record reveals that defense counsel challenged the search \nwarrant in a motion to suppress evidence on the basis that the warrant affidavit lacked probable \ncause. (D.I. 16 at 3) Respondent filed a response, detailing how probable cause for the warrant was \nestablished when the NCCPD detective conclusively identified child pornography on Movant's \ncomputer hard drive through the use of digital fingerprints of known child pornography files. (D.l. \n38 at 3-4) Before the Court could rule on Movant's suppression motion, Movant agreed to enter \ninto a plea agreement to the Superseding Indictment. Considering that counsel filed a suppression \nmotion, the Court construes movant's contention that counsel did not \"argue enough\" about the \n\"four times that they tried to receive evidence for a search warrant\" as alleging that counsel's \nsuppression motion failed to stress certain deficiencies in the affidavit of probable cause. \nMovant's vague assertion of ineffective assistance is unavailing. First, Movant fails to \ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that the suppression motion would have been granted if \ncounsel had presented either a different or more vehement argument. Second, once Movant agreed \nto enter the plea agreement, counsel had no reason to pursue the suppression motion. Finally, \nMovant does not contend that he would not have pled guilty and would have proceeded to trial but \nfor counsel's failure to \"argue enough\" in the suppression motion. For all of these reasons, the \nCourt concludes that Claim Six lacks merit. \n15 H. Claim Seven: Appellate Representation \nIn his final claim, Movant states that he \"was told to take this plea and we could appeal it. \nThen [defense counsel] studied the laws some more and decided we couldn't. Then [defense \ncounsel] withdrew from being my counsel.\" (D.I. 73 at 3) In his amendment, Movant asserts \n[counsel] told me that I should accept the plea I signed saying all its contents were normal \nfor a plea deal and that we could still appeal it on other grounds like the one book rule. \nAfter I had accepted it, [counsel] said he had to go study up on the grounds for appealing it. \n[Counsel] decided that we couldn't appeal it and then resigned as my lawyer. \n(D.I. 79 at 1) The Court liberally construes these statements to present a double-layered ineffective \nassistance of counsel claim. First, Movant appears to contend that counsel's act of filing an Anders \nbrief and a motion to withdraw as counsel constituted ineffective assistance in and of itself. Second, \nMovant appears to contend that counsel was ineffective because he did not immediately understand \nthe scope of the appellate waiver and subsequently determined that there were no meritorious issues \nto raise on appeal. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that neither of these \ninterpretations warrants relief. \n1. Filed Anders Brief and Motion to Withdraw \nClaims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are evaluated under the same Strickland \nstandard applicable to trial counsel. See Lewis v. Johnson, 359 F.3d 646, 656 (3d Cir. 2004). An \nattorney's decision about which issues to raise on appeal are strategic, and an attorney is not required \nto raise every possible non-frivolous issue on appeal. See Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 272 (2000); \nJones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745 (1983). 1Recognizing that an attorney is \"under an ethical obligation to \nrefuse to prosecute a frivolous appeal,\" the Supreme Court has held that an attorney may withdraw \nfrom representing a client on appeal, so long as the attorney follows a procedure that \"affords \nadequate and effective appellate review to [the] indigent defendantO\" and therefore \"reasonably \nensures that an indigent appeal will be resolved in a way that is related to the merit of that appeal.\" \n16 Smith, 528 U.S. at 272, 276-77. In Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967),4 the United States \nSupreme Court articulated a procedure designed to protect an indigent appellant's constitutional \nrights when his attorney moves to withdraw. Pursuant to Anders, defense counsel must conduct a \n\"conscientious examination\" of the case before seeking to withdraw from the case, and then file an \nappellate brief \"referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\" Id. at \n744. The defendant must be given a copy of counsel's brief and given an opportunity to raise any \npoints he wishes. Id. Then, the appellate court must conduct a \"full examination of all the \nproceedings to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\" Id. \"If the court is satisfied that \ncounsel has diligently investigated the possible grounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel's \nevaluation of the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed and leave to appeal may be denied.\" \nId. at 7 41-42; see also McCqy v. Ct. App. of Wisconsin, Dzst. 1, 486 U.S. 429, 442 (1988). \nThe record in this case reveals that counsel followed the proper procedure for withdrawal \nunder Anders. Defense counsel filed a timely notice of appeal, along with an Anders brief raising the \nfollowing three issues: (1) did the Court have jurisdiction to consider this case; (2) did the plea \ncolloquy violate the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and (3) did the Court use the wrong \nversion of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. See Phillips, 396 F. App'x at 833. \nDefense counsel addressed each of these arguments in his Anders Brief, and determined that further \nargument on these issues would be frivolous. The Third Circuit conducted its own independent \nreview of the record, determined that counsel made a conscientious examination of the record \nbefore moving to withdraw, and concluded that Movant's appeal was wholly without merit. See \nPhillips, 396 F. App'x at 833-35. Given these circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that counsel \n4Although the Smith Court acknowledged that there may be procedures other than the one \narticulated in Anders, Anders is still good law. See Smith, 528 U.S. at 273. \n17 provided ineffective assistance by filing a non-merits appellate brief under Anders and a motion to \nwithdraw. \n2. Initially Misunderstood Scope of Appellate Waiver \nThe Memorandum of Plea Agreement in this case contains the following appellate waiver: \nThe defendant knows that he has, and voluntarily and expressly waives, the right to file any \nappeal, any collateral attack, or any other writ or motion after sentencing -including, but not \nlimited to an appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, or a motion under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2255 -except that the defendant reserves his right to appeal only if (1) the \nGovernment appeals from the sentence, (2) the defendant's sentence exceeds the statutory \nmaximum for the offense set forth in the United States Code, (3) the defendant claims his \nsentence unreasonably exceeds the Sentencing Guidelines range determined by the District \nCourt in applying the United States Sentencing Guidelines, (4) the defendant claims his \ncounsel was constitutionally ineffective, or (5) the defendant claims the Court determined his \nguidelines range under the wrong version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines \nManual. \n(D.I. 47 at~ 11) \nIn this case, even if defense counsel initially advised Movant there were issues to appeal and \nthen, upon further review, decided that there were no appealable issues that fell outside the scope of \nlimited appellate waiver, this conduct does not amount to ineffective assistance. Movant does not \nspecify any argument defense counsel initially stated could be made on appeal, he does not identify \nany specific argument he believes fell outside the limited appellate waiver that counsel failed to raise \non appeal, and he does not contend that he would not have pled guilty but would have proceeded to \ntrial but for counsel's statement that there were appealable issues. Therefore, Movant's contention \nregarding counsel's allegedly initial inaccurate interpretation of the appellate waiver does not warrant \nrelief. \nThe Court acknowledges that Movant may be attempting to argue that defense counsel was \nineffective for advising him to accept the plea offer with the appellate waiver, or that counsel's \nalleged initial misunderstanding about the scope of the appellate waiver rendered his guilty plea \nunknowing and involuntary. The Court is not persuaded by either contention. Once again, the \n18 Court notes Movant does not contend that he would not have pled guilty and would have \nproceeded to trial but for counsel's advice. Moreover, Movant does not allege, and the record does \nnot reveal, that the appellate waiver was unknowing or involuntary. In fact, the change of plea \ncolloquy demonstrates that the Court thoroughly explained the appellate waiver to Movant, that \nMovant stated he understood the rights he was waiving, and that Movant knowingly, voluntarily, \nand intelligently entered into the plea agreement despite the existence of the appellate waiver. (D.I. \n71 at 22-25) During that same plea colloquy, Movant stated that he was satisfied with counsel's \nexplanation of the appellate waiver and that counsel had answered any questions Movant had about \nthe waiver. (Id. at 25-27) Finally, on appeal, counsel actually presented arguments that fell outside \nthe scope of the appellate waiver; the fact that the Third Circuit found those arguments to be \nwithout merit does not in any way cast a shadow on counsel's advice to enter into a plea agreement \ncontaining such a waiver. \nFor all of these reasons, the Court will deny Movant's claim that counsel provided \nineffective assistance on appeal. \nV. EVIDENTIARY HEARING \nSection 2255 requires a district court to hold a prompt evidentiary hearing unless the \n\"motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show\" that the Movant is not entitled to \nrelief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; see also United States v. Booth, 432 F.3d 542, 545-46 (3d Cir. 2005); United \nStates v. McCqy, 410 F.3d 124, 131 (3d Cir. 2005); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2255. As \npreviously explained, the record conclusively demonstrates that Movant is not entitled to relief. \nTherefore, the Court will deny Movant's \u00a7 2255 Motion without an evidentiary hearing. \nVI. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion must also decide whether to \nissue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of appealability is \n19 appropriate only if the movant \"has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional \nright.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The movant must \"demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find \nthe district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\" Slack v. McDaniel, \n529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). \nThe Court is denying Movant's \u00a7 2255 motion after determining that his ineffective \nassistance of counsel claims lack merit. The Court is persuaded that reasonable jurists would not \nfind this assessment debatable. Therefore, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability. \nVII. CONCLUSION \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss Movant's 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Motion to \nVacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence without an evidentiary hearing. Additionally, the Court will \nnot issue a certificate of appealability. The Court shall issue an appropriate Order. \n20 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nWILLIAM A.
