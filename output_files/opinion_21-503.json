(D.I. 10)  For the reasons that follow, the Court recommends that the Motion be \nGRANTED- IN-PART and DE NIED -IN-PART.  2 I. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs commenced this action on April 6, 2021, in which they sought , inter alia , the \nfollowing relief against Defendant :  (1) in Count I, payment for certain unpaid contributions that \nwere allegedly due to the Funds , pursuant t o the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974 (\u201c ERISA \u201d), see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132(g) & 1145; (2) in Count II, payment of damages \nallegedly owed by Defendant  due to its failure to make the above -referenced contributions, \npursuant to a  breach of contract theory, see  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (\u201cSection 185\u201d) ; and (3) in Count \nIII, an order requiring Defendant to submit to an audit of its records as to related matters .  (D.I. \n1)1  After being served  with the Complaint, Defendant did not file an Answer, nor did it \notherwise appear or mount a defense in the action .  Thus, at Plaintiff s\u2019 request,  on June 7, 2021, \nthe Clerk of Court entered a default as to Defendant  pursuant to Rule 55(a) .  (D.I. 5)  \nPlaintiffs filed the Motion on December 14, 2021, along with an opening brief in support.  \n(D.I. 10; D.I. 11)  The Motion was thereafter referred to the Court for resolution on January 11, \n2022 by United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika.  (D.I. 12)  The  Court held a n \nevidentiary hearing (\u201cthe hearing\u201d)  on the Motion on May 2, 2022.  (D.I. 13 ; see also  Transcript \nof May 2, 2022 Hearing (hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d) )  During the hearing, the Court raised certain \nquestions regarding the relief that Plaintiffs were seeking in their proposed Judgment, (D.I. 10-1); at the conclusion of the hearing, P laintiffs \u2019 counsel sought the ability to file a supplemental \nbrief (the \u201csupplemental brief\u201d)  in order to further augment the record in this regard.  The C ourt \ngranted this  request , and Plaintiffs filed the ir supplemental brief on June 1, 2022.  (D.I. 14)   \n \n1  The Complaint also include s certain requests for post -audit relief  (in Counts IV \nand V) and a claim for conversion (in Count VI ).  (D.I. 1)  In terms of the default judgment \nrequested at this stage, however, Counts I to III are the most pertinent counts. 3 Because Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief made reference to certain damages amounts that \nwere inconsistent with those contained in Plaintiffs original proposed Judgment, ( see, e.g ., D.I. \n14 at 10- 12), the Court requested that Plaintiffs submit an amended proposed form of Judgment  \nthat tracked their current requests for relief.  Plaintiffs filed an amended pr oposed Judgment (the \n\u201camended proposed Judgment\u201d)  on July 19, 2022.  (D.I. 15)2 \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nEntry of a default judgment  is a two-step process.   First,  the Clerk  of the Court  must  enter  \na default , which  occurs  \u201c[w]hen  a party  against  whom  a judgment  for affirmative  relief  is sought  \nhas failed  to plead  or otherwise  defend, and  that failure  is shown by affidavit  or otherwise.\u201d   Fed. \nR. Civ. P.  55(a) .  After  entry  of default,  if the relief  sought  against  the defaulted party  is not for a  \n\u201csum  certain  or a sum  that can be made certain  by comp utation,\u201d  then  the party  seeking  default  \nmust  apply to  the court  for the  entry  of a default  judgment.  Fed.  R. Civ. P.  55(b)(1) -(2).   \nThe decision  to enter  a default  judgment  is within  the discretion  of the court.   Tristrata  \nTech.,  Inc. v. Med.  Skin  Thera py Research,  Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D.  Del.  2010)  (citing  Hritz  \nv. Woma  Corp., 732 F.2d  1178, 1180 (3d  Cir. 1984) ).  The  court\u2019s  determination  as to whether  to \ngrant  this type  of motion  is guided by three considerations:   \u201c(1)  prejudice to  the plaintiff  if \ndefault  is denied, (2) whether  the defendant  appears  to have  a litigable  defense,  and (3) whether  \ndefendant\u2019s  delay  is due to culpable  conduct.\u201d   Chamberlain v.  Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 \n(3d Cir. 2000).3   \n \n2  Unless otherwise set out below, references to Plaintiffs \u2019 proposed Judgment will \nbe to the amended proposed Judgment that Plaintiffs submitted on July 19, 2022. \n3  In their briefing, Plaintiffs do not explicitly discuss these three considerations; \ninstead, the ir briefing is focused on demonstrating the type and amount of relief that Plaintiffs \nbelieve is owed to them.  The Court is required to consider these factors, however, see U.S. v. \n$55,518.05 in U.S. Currency , 728 F.2d 192, 195 (3d Cir. 1984); Emerson Radio Corp. v. 4 A party  who  defaults  by failing  to plead  or defend  admits  the allegations  in the complaint  \nrelated  to the claims,  but does  not admit the  allegations  in the complaint  as to the amount  of \ndamages.   J & J Sports  Prod., Inc.  v. Kim , C.A.  No. 14- 1170- LPS,  2016 WL  1238223, at  *1 (D.  \nDel. Mar.  29, 2016).  In assessing  a motion  for a  default  judgment, the  court  should take the  \nnecessary  steps  to establish  damages  with  reasonable  certainty.   See  Transatlantic  Marine  \nClaims  Agency,  Inc. v. Ace Shipping Corp., Div.  of Ace Young Inc. , 109 F.3d 105, 111 (2d  Cir. \n1997);  Palmer  v. Slaughter , No.  Civ.A. 99- 899-GMS,  2000 WL  1010261, at  *2 (D.  Del.  July 13, \n2020);  WM Capital  Partners  XXXIV,  LLC  v. Bartholomew , CIVIL  ACTION  NO.  15-06225, \n2017 WL  118110, at  *9 (E.D.  Pa. Jan. 12, 2017).  \nIII. DISCUSSION    \n \nEmerson Quiet Kool Co., Ltd., C.A. No. 20- 1652, 2022 WL 1156194, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 19, \n2022), and so it will do so here.   \nIn the Court\u2019s view, the record is sufficient to establish that these co nsiderations weigh in \nfavor of entry of a default judgment.  With regard to the first consideration, there is obvious \nprejudice here in the absence of entry of a default judgment, in that because Defendant utterly failed to participate in the pre -trial pro cess, if a default judgment were not obtained, there would \nbe no other avenue for Plaintiffs to obtain relief for their claims.  See Emerson , 2022 WL \n1156194, at *2; S.E.C. v. Krimm , 1:17- CV-464, 2019 WL 2270437, at *5 (D. Del. May 28, \n2019); Tristrata  Tech., Inc. , 270 F.R.D. at  164.  As to the second consideration, Defendant did \nnot file an Answer, and so it is hard to know whether it would have a meritorious defense.  That renders this consideration inconclusive.  See Hill v. Williamsport Police Dept., 69 F. App\u2019x 49, 52 (3d Cir. 2003); Tristrata  Tech.,  Inc., 270 F.R.D. at  164.  With regard to the third \nconsideration, there is evidence to indicate that Defendant\u2019s delay in participating in this action is due to willful or bad faith conduct.  See Emerson , 2022 WL 1156194, at *4.  Defendant was \nserved with the Complaint in May 2021, over one year ago.  (D.I. 3; D.I. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4)  At no point in that lengthy period of time has Defendant had counsel enter an appearance in the case; no answer was filed, and no other attempt to defend has been made.  This appears to be a willful attempt not to participate in the litigation.  Cf . Krimm , 2019 WL 2270437, at *5; Tristrata  Tech.,  \nInc., 270 F.R.D. at 164.  With two of the factors supporting Plaintiffs\u2019 M otion and one being \ninconclusive at best for Defendant, these considerations militate in favor of entry of a default judgment.   5  As was noted above, the Clerk of the Court entered an Entry of Default against Defendant \non June 7, 2021.  (D.I. 5)   Thus, step one of the two -part default judgment process has been \nsatisfied.  At step two, Plaintiffs\u2019 Mo tion seeks a judgment in the form of:  (1) $41,425.30 in \ndamages regarding unpaid contributions  (through November 2020) , (D.I. 14 at 11; D.I. 15 at \u00b6 \n2); (2) pre -judgment interest in the amount of $13,234.46 (through June  30, 2022) , as well as \npost-judgment interest,  (D.I. 1 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 5 ); (3) liquidated damages in the amount of $8,035.44, \n(D.I. 14 at 11; D.I. 15 at \u00b6 2) ; and (4) attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $35,971.93 (through July \n19, 2022),  (D.I. 1 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5) .  Plaintiffs also request that Defendant and all persons acting on \nbehalf or in conjunction with Defendant  be required to submit to an audit of Defendant\u2019s wage, \npayroll and personnel records , as is further discussed below.  (D.I. 15 at \u00b6 6)  The Court will \naddress each of these forms of requested relief in turn. \nA. Unpaid Contributions  \n Plaintiffs first seek $41,425.30 in damages in the form of unpaid contributions  from April \n2020 through November 2020.4  (D.I. 14 at 11- 12; D.I. 15 at \u00b6 2)   With regard to that request, \nPlaintiffs explained that pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and \nDefendant (the \u201cLabor Contract\u201d), Defendant was required to submit remittance reports and pay \ncontributions to Plaintiffs for time worked by or paid to covered employees .  (D.I. 11 at 4, 16)  \nThe Labor Contract sets forth a particular required contribution rate per employee  as to each of \n \n4  In Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that unpaid contributions are owed for \n\u201cthe periods March 2015 through December 2015\u201d and \u201cJanuary 2016 through December \n2018[.]\u201d  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6  26)  This appears to the Court to be a mistake, because:  (1)  Plaintiffs\u2019 \namended proposed Judgment seeks only contributions owed for the period between April 2020 and November 2020, (D.I. 15 at \u00b6  3(a)); (2) Defendant only signed the contract  at issue here in \nDecember 2019, (D.I. 11, ex. 1) ; and (3) Defendant only became active in  the relevant \njurisdiction in April 2020, (Tr. at 24).  6 various F unds  (with the exception of the \u201cUA Organizing Fund,\u201d as is further set out below)  for \nwhich Plaintiffs seek damages here.   (D.I. 11, ex. 1 at Art. VIII5 at \u00a7\u00a7 4- 12)6  Pursuant to the \nallegations in the Complaint, now deemed admitted, Defendant\u2019s failure to pay over these \ncontributions \u2014contributions required by the \u201cLabor Contract \u201d or by \u201cother documents \nincorporated by the Labor Contract, such as the Trust Agreements or plan documents of the Funds\u201d \u2014entitles Plaintiffs\u2019 to recoup these monies by way of a damages award.  (D.I. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-\n27; see also  Tr. at 13- 19)   \n During the hearing, the Court walked through with Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel where each of the \nvarious F unds on whose behalf Plaintiffs are seeking damages are actually referenced in Article \nVIII of the Labor Contract  (with the exception of the \u201cUA Organizing Fund\u201d ).  (Compare  D.I. 15 \nat \u00b6 2, with  D.I. 11, ex. 1 at Art. VIII; see also  Tr. at 15- 18)  These are, respectively:  the Welfare \nFund, Pension Fund, Annuity Fund, Apprenticeship Fund and  Scholarship Fund, as well as an \n\u201cEducation Fund, \u201d a \u201cPAC Fund,\u201d  a \u201cBuilding Fund,\u201d an  \u201cIndustry Advancement Fund \u201d, and a \nfund for \u201c Dues .\u201d  (Id.)  As to each of these Funds, the Labor Contract also explains how relevant \ncontribution amounts are to be calculated.  ( D.I. 11, ex. 1 at Art. VIII )   \n \n5  Although Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief occasionally refers to Article \u201cVII\u201d as the \nArticle in the Labor Contract that obligate s Defendant to make these contributions, it is  in fact  \nArticle VIII that d oes so.  (Tr. at 14)   \n6  Plaintiffs\u2019 amended proposed judgment makes reference to two different amounts \nof unpaid  contributions owed\u2014one amount allegedly owed pursuant to alleged ERISA viol ations \nreferenced in Count I , pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132(g) & 1145, and one amount allegedly owed \npursuant to the  breach of contract theory referenced in Count II , pursuant to Section 185.  ( D.I. \n15)  The second amount is larger than the first amount (b ecause a few of the P lans as to which \ncontributions are sought therein are not ERISA plans) and it thus correlates with Plaintiffs\u2019 \nultimate request for unpaid contribution- related  damages here.  (Tr. at 8 -9; D.I. 11 at 14- 16)  For \nthat reason, the Court will assess Plaintiffs\u2019 request for damages  in the form of unpaid \ncontributions solely pursuant to Count II\u2019s Section 185 claim . 7 However, because the Court could not see any reference in the Labor Contract to a UA \nOrganizing Fund, it asked P laintiffs \u2019 counsel to explain, via its supplemental brief, how \nDefendant was obligated to make contributions regarding that  particular  Fund pursuant to, inter \nalia, the breach -of-contract -rationale set out in Count II of the Complaint.  (Tr. at 17- 18)  In their \nsupplemental brief, Plaintiffs:  (1) confirmed that the UA Organizing Fund is not referenced by \nname in the Labor Contract; (2) stated that the UA Organizing Fund is \u201cnot funded by employers \nbut instead by withholding from employee pay (similar to the checkoffs authorized in Art. VIII, Section 10 of the CBA)\u201d ; (3) stated that a \u201crate of ten cents per hour worked was authorized at a \nmeeting of the Union\u201d  in June 2019 and was \u201cagreed to by respective business manager [s] of the \nUnion and the chair of the [Delaware Mechanical Contractors Association, or \u2018 DMCA\u2019 ]\u201d; and \n(4) asserted that a rate sheet setting out this rate is \u201c deemed to be incorporated into the [Labor \nContract] and therefore binding on Defendant.\u201d   (D.I. 14 at 10)   \nThis ( very brief) explanation was not sufficient for the Court to understand how damages \nin the form of unpaid contributions owed to the UA Organizing Fund necessarily flow from the now-admitted breach of contract allegations  in Count II.  Defendant did sign the Labor Contract \nwith the Union, but nothing in that contract references the UA Organizing Fund directly.  Count \nII makes reference to other documents being incorporated int o the Labor Contract, such as \u201c Trust \nAgreements\u201d or \u201cplan documents of the Funds\u201d but it is not clear how any of the documents that \npurportedly bind Defendant with regard to these asserted UA Organizing Fund- related damages \nare \u201cTrust Agreements\u201d or \u201cplan documents of the Funds.\u201d  And as for the assertion that the rate sheet is \u201cdeemed to be incorporated\u201d into the Labor Contract, Plaintiffs simply did not provide 8 the Court with enough argument or explanation to understand how it  is that this is said to be so.7  \nTherefore, because the asserted basis for damages regarding the UA Organizing Fund does not \nappear to be explicitly captured by the contractual provisions of the Labor Contract or the allegations in Count II , and because such a basis has not otherwise been provided to the Court by \nPlaintiffs, below the Court will not recommend that damages relating to that F und ( $95.29 in \nunpaid contributions, plus $30.39 in interest and $9.53 in liquidated damages) be awarded.  ( D.I. \n14 at 11- 12; D.I. 1 5 at \u00b6 2)     \nWith regard to the remaining F unds /alleged contributions owed, Plaintiffs seek a total of \n$41,330.01.  ( Id.)  In order to establish th at this  amount of unpaid contributions  is owed, \nPlaintiffs attached to their opening brief the sworn declaration of Scott A. Ernsberger  (the \n\u201cErnsberger Declaration\u201d) ; Mr. Ernsberger is  employed by Zenith American Solutions  \n(\u201cZenith\u201d) , the contract third party administrator to the Funds.  (D.I. 11, ex. 6; see also  Tr. at 22)  \nAdditionally, during the hearing, Mr. Ernsberger provided sworn testimony in which he explained how he determined that the requested amount s of unpaid contributions /damages  were \nowed.  More specifically, Mr. Ernsberger stated  that:   \n(1)  Zenith  confirmed \u2014by way of conversations with the Union \nand from communications from certain of Defendant\u2019s own \ncovered employees \u2014that Defendant had Union employees who \ncontinued to work in the relevant jurisdiction  between April 2020 \n \n7  For this proposition, Plaintiffs simply cited to one case from the United States \nCourt of Appea ls for the Ninth Circuit.  In that case, the Ninth Circuit found that there was \nsubstantial evidence to support the conclusion that a particular schedule was incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement \u2014evidence including witness testimony and documentary \nevidence.  See Delta Sandblasting Co., Inc. v. Nat. Labor Relations Bd., 969 F.3d 957, 963- 65 \n(9th Cir. 2020).  Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs have provided no such evidence that makes it clear to the Court how any of the cited documents regarding UA Organizing Fund contributions were incorporated by reference into the Labor Contract.  9 and November 2020, but for whom Defenda nt had not submitted  \nremittance reports and contributions  to the Funds.8; \n \n(2)  Zenith obtained paystubs from certain of these employees during the months in question, substantiating th e hours that the se  \nemployees actually worked; and  \n (3) Zenith  then  took these paystubs , confirmed that the hours and \ngross wages referenced therein h ad not been reported by \nDefendant, calculated what monies Defendant should have submitted to the Funds as to these employee hours (using the rates  \nand designations  set out in the Labor Contract for each Fund) and \nthen created a report reflecting those amou nts.  \n \n(D.I. 11, ex. 6 at \u00b6 7(a)- (b); D.I. 14 at 11- 12; Tr. at 23- 36)  Excluding the UA Organizing Fund, \nthe amount Zenith determined was owed to the Funds for the time period in question, using this \nmethodology, was the  $41,330.01 referenced above.  ( D.I. 11, ex. 6 at \u00b6 7(b); D.I. 14 at 11- 12)   \nIn light of Mr. Ernsberger\u2019s testimony, the Court concludes that there is  sufficient basis to \ndemonstrate that this amount of unpaid contributions is owed in damages to the Funds  (through \nNovember 2020) .  See, e.g., State Bank & Tr. Co. v. Philly Wholesale, LLC , CIVIL ACTION \nNo. 16- 05508, 2017 WL 4222936, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 22, 2017) .  It thus recommends that the \nDistrict Court award $41,330.01 in damages for unpaid contributions owed.  \n B.  Liquidated Damages  \n Plaintiffs are seeking liquidated damages equalling $8,035.44.  ( D.I. 14 at 12; D.I. 15 at \u00b6 \n2)  Essentially, this amount represents a request for:  (1) 10% of the unpaid contributions in liquidated damages as to all Funds at issue; and (2) an additional 10% (for a total of 20%) of the \n \n8  Defendant did submit remittance reports and contributions for certain Union  \nemployees from mid -May 2020 through June 2020; those employee hours are not included in \nMr. Ernsberger\u2019s calculations.  (Tr. at 24, 29)   10 unpaid contributions in liquidated damages as to the five ERSIA Funds at issue (the Pension \nFund, Annuity Fund, Welfare Fund, Scholarship Fund and Apprenticeship Fund).9    \n In support of this request, Plaintiffs note that pursuant to Article VIII, Section 12.A of the \nLabor Contract, if remittance reports and Fund payme nts are not received or postmarked by the \n28th day of the month following the month covered by such reports, then Defendant contractually owes liquidated damages in the amount of 10% of the required payment.  (D.I. 11, \nex. 1 at Art. VIII  at \u00a7 12.A; D.I. 14 at 10 -11)  Plaintiffs also note that , inter alia , Section \n502(g)(2) of ERISA provides that if judgment in favor of an ERISA plan is awarded, then a court \nshall also award the plan liquidated damages provided for under the plan \u201cnot in excess of 20 \npercent  . . . of the amount determined by the court [as the amount owed for unpaid \ncontributions.]\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)  (cited in  D.I. 14 at 11).  They  also show  how , as to the \nfive relevant ERISA plans in question, those plans in turn specify that t he Board of Trustees of \n \n9  Plaintiffs \u2019 original proposed Judgement sought a total of $8,288.23 in liquidated \ndamages.  (D.I. 10- 1 at \u00b6 2)  In their supplemental brief, Plaintiffs stated that they later \ndetermined that this amount was a mistake and that they now sought only $8,035.44 in damages.   \n(D.I. 14 at 11 & n.5)  Then in their amended proposed Judgment, Plaintiffs sought $8,035.46 in liquidated damages.  (D.I. 15 at \u00b6  2)  Plaintiffs do not explain why the latter two numbers \ndiverge.   \nFrom comparing the chart listed on page 12 of Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief with the \ncharts listed in Plaintiffs amended proposed Judgment, it appear s that (again, without \nexplanation), Plaintiffs included different amounts of unpaid contributions in the supplemental brief for the Welfare Fund and Annuity Fund than they did in the amended proposed Judgement \n(and their original proposed Judgment).  ( Com pare D.I. 14 at 12, with  D.I. 10 -1 & D.I. 15)  The \namounts of unpaid contributions in the respective Judgments are the amounts that Mr. Ernsberger\u2019s testimony were based on, and so those are the amounts of unpaid contributions that  the Court will utilize here.  When one relies on those amounts of unpaid contributions, and then assesses  the types of liquidated damages that Plaintiffs are seeking (i.e., 10% as to all Funds, and \nan additional 10% as to the five ERISA funds), it appears to the Court that the correct amount of \nliquidated damages that Plaintiffs  really  mean to seek is $8,035.44.  And so that is the figure the \nCourt will consider below.   11 those funds may make special rules  relating  to employers like Defendant, including as to the \nassessment of liquidated damages  for unpaid contributions .  (D.I. 11, ex. 2 at Art . VII  at \u00a7 7.01; \nid., ex. 3 at Art . VII at \u00a7 7.26; id ., ex. 4 at Art. VII at \u00a7 7.01; D.I. 14, ex. 13 at Art. IV at \u00a7 4.08; \nid., ex. 14 at 7- 8; see also  id., ex. 6 at \u00b6 7(c); D.I. 14 at 11)   Lastly, Plaintiffs point to one such \ndocument that sets out such \u201cspecial rules\u201d \u2014a document titled \u201cPlumbers and Pipefitters Local \nUnion No. 74 Funds Policy for the Collection of Contributions Owed to the Funds \u201d (the \n\u201cCollection Policy\u201d) ; in the Collection Policy , the Trustees of the Pension Fund, Annuity Plan, \nWelfare Fund  and Scholarship Fund authorized that for an y employer whose contributions \nremain unpaid after the 28th day of the second month after the contribution obligation was \nincurred , that employer  must pay liquidated damages of an additional 10% of the required unpaid \ncontributions.  (D.I. 11, ex. 5 at \u00a7 5; id ., ex. 6 at \u00b6  6; D.I. 14 at 11)  \n Of the $8,035.44 that Plaintiffs are seeking for liquidated damages , $4,142.53 of that total \namounts to 10% of all of the unpaid contributions owed to Welfare Fund, Pension Fund, Annuity Fund, Apprenticeship Fund, S cholarship Fund, Education Fund, PAC Fund, Building Fund, \nIndustry Advancement Fund, UA Organizing Fund, and for Dues.  (D.I. 14 at 11- 12)  The Court \nhas already explained why it will not recommend that a damages award include monies relating to the UA Organizing Fund;  taking this amount ($9.53) out  of the $4,142.53 total leaves one with \n$4,133.00.  ( Id.)  As to all of this amount, the Court can see, at a minimum, how it is money \nowed pursuant to Count II\u2019s breach of contract -related allegations.   \n The remainder of the amount sought in liquidated damages is $3,892.91; these are an \nadditional 10% of damages owed and never paid regarding the five ERISA plans at issue (the \nWelfare Fund, Pension Fund, Annuity Fund, Apprenticeship Fund and Scholarship Fund) .  (Id.) \nThe Court see s how, pursuant to Section 502(g)(2) of ERISA, Plaintiffs could  obtain an 12 additional 10% in liquidated damages  as to these five funds , so long as such damages are \n\u201cprovided for under the plan[.]\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2).  As noted above , Plaintiffs provided the \nCourt with the ERISA plan  documents for the five ERISA Funds at issue.  W hen one reads \nportions of those  plan  documents  together with the Collection Policy, the Court can understand \nhow an additional 10% in liquidated damages is authorized\u2014at least as to the four ERISA \nplans /Funds  who are actually parties to the Collection Policy (i.e., the Pension Fund, Annuity \nPlan, Welfare Fun d and Scholarship Fund) .  (D.I. 11, ex. 2 at Art . VII at \u00a7 7.01; id ., ex. 3 at Art . \nVII at \u00a7 7.26; id ., ex. 4 at Art. VII at \u00a7 7.01; D.I. 14, ex. 13 at Art. IV at \u00a7 4.08; id ., ex. 14 at 7- 8; \nsee also  D.I. 11, ex. 5 at \u00a7 5)   But the fifth plan/Fund\u2014the Apprenticeship Fund\u2014does not \nappear to be a party to the Collection Policy.  (D.I. 11, ex. 5 at 1 (\u201cThe undersigned Trustees . . . \nof the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union No. 74 Pension, Annuity, Welfare, and Scholarship Funds (\u2018the Funds \u2019) . . . amend and restate the Board\u2019s policy for collection of employer \ncontributions owed to the Funds[.]\u201d))  And so the Court does not understand how Plaintiffs have shown that an additional 10% in liquidated damages is authorized under ERISA as to th e \nApprenticesh ip Fund.   \nSimilarly, the Court has not been provided with sufficient information to see how these \nadditional liquidated damages for the  the Apprenticeship Fund could be obtained pursuant to \nCount II\u2019s breach of contract claim .  The Labor Contract does sta te that signatories agree to be \nbound by the terms of the pla ns/trust agreements , and each of the five relevant plan/trust \nagreements seem to allow the respective Funds\u2019 Boards of Trustees to permit additional amounts of liquidated damages to be imposed be yond an  initial 10% figure.  But it is the Collection Policy  \nthat Plaintiffs are pointing to as the document that actually provides for  an additional 10% \namount in liquidated damages here.  And that Collection Policy does not appear to facially apply 13 to the Apprenticeship Fund.  So t he Court can only recommend that an additional $3,785.87 \n(representing an additional 10% of liquidated damages owed regarding the Welfare Fund, \nPension Fund, Annuity Fund and Scholarship Fund) be paid in damages.   \n In total, then, the Court recommends that liquidated damages be awarded in the amount \nof $7,918.87.   \nC.    Interest  \n Plaintiffs are seeking damages in the form of interest in the amount of $13,234.46, \nthrough June 30, 2022, pursua nt to the breach of contract claim in Count II .  (D.I. 15 at  \u00b6 2; Tr. at \n42-43)  These monies relate to interest allegedly owed (1 .5% per month on contributions that \nremain unpaid more than one month from the due date) as to the  unpaid contributions referr ed to \nin Section III.A  for the period through June 30, 2022.  (D.I. 15 at \u00b6  2; see also  D.I. 11, ex. 6 at \u00b6  \n7(d); Tr. at 45)  \n In order to show its entitlement to such interest, Plaintiffs are relying on the  content of \nthe Collection Policy, wherein that policy describes how such interest can be owed  by entities \nlike Defendant.   (D.I. 11 at 18; id ., ex. 6 at \u00b6  7(d); D.I. 15 at \u00b6  2; Tr. at 43; see also  D.I. 11, ex. 5 \nat \u00b6 5)10  The Court can understand, based on the documents provided to it, how the Labor \nContract:  (a) incorporates by reference rules and regulations contained in the respective trust agreements for the Welfare Fund, Pension Fund, Annuity Fund and Scholarship Fund ( D.I. 11, \nex. 1 at Art. VIII at  \u00a7\u00a7 4.D, 4.E, 5.D, 5.F , 6 & 8 ); (b) how those plans/trust agreements expressly \n \n10  In the amended proposed Judgment, Plaintiffs assert that interest is being sought \n\u201cin accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6621 [ \u2018Section 6621\u2019 ] from the date the contributions became \ndue.\u201d  (D.I. 15 at \u00b6  3(b))   This also appears to be a mistake, as in Count II itself , in the \nErnsberger Declaration , in its briefing , and during the hearing, Plaintiffs  state that they are \nseeking interest in accordance with the methodology set out in the Collection Policy, not in \nSection 6621.  ( D.I. 1 at \u00b6 27; D.I. 11 at 18; id ., ex. 6 at \u00b6 7(d) ; Tr. at 43)  14 permit the plans\u2019 Board of Trustees to make special rules applicable to each employer regarding \nthe assessment of interest, ( id., ex. 2 at Art . VII at \u00a7 7.01; id ., ex. 3 at Art . VII at \u00a7 7.29; id ., ex. 4 \nat Art. VII at \u00a7 7.01; D.I. 14, ex. 14 at 7- 8); and (c) how  the terms of the Collection Policy \n(which calls for interest in the form of 1.5% per month to be paid if collections are unpaid for more than 56 days) , adopted by those four Funds, can be said to amount to such a rule, ( id., ex. 5 \nat \u00b6 5).  But Plaintiffs have not fully explained how they can obtain such interest payments on a \nbreach -of-contract rationale as to the other Funds for which they seek such interest  (i.e., the \nApprenticeship Fund, Education Fund, PAC Fund, Building Fund, Industry Advancement Fund, \nUA Organizing Fund and for Dues ).  (D.I. 1 5 at \u00b6 2)  There may be such a rationale, but \nPlaintiffs simply have not provided it to the Court in a way the Court can understand.  \nTherefore, the Court recommends that the District Court award damages in the form of \npre-judgment interest as to  unpaid contributions regarding the Pension Fund, Annuity Fund, \nWelfare Fund  and Scholarship Fund.  Mr. Ernsberger explained that he calculated interest using \nthe methodology described in the Collection Policy for those Funds through November 30, 2021; the amount there equaled $8,138.85.  (D.I. 10- 1 at \u00b6 2; Tr. at 45)  In their amended proposed \nJudgment , Plaintiffs have upped that figure (without providing a ny supporting documentation) \nfor the four  Funds to $12,091.27, now reflecting interest owed up through June 30, 2022.  (D.I. \n15 at \u00b6  2)  That said, the Court can infer from the totality of the record that this revised \ncalculation was conducted by Mr. Ernsberger in the same manner as reflected in his testimony, and it thus recommends that $12,091.27 be awarded in pre- judgment interest.\n11   \n D.   Attorney s\u2019 Fees and Costs  \n \n11  Plaintiffs would also be  entitled to post -judgment interest pursuant to, inter alia , \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961; (D.I. 15 at \u00b6  5(f)).  15  Next, Plaintiffs seek $35,971.93 in damages for attorneys \u2019 fees and costs, for the period \nfrom January 6, 2021 through July 19, 2022.  (D.I. 1 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 2- 3, 5)  At a minimum, ERISA (i.e., \nthe claim in Count I) provides that a prevailing party is entitled to its reasonable attorneys \u2019 fees \nand costs  associated with an action arising out of a defendant failing to pay required \ncontributions.  See Bricklayers & Allied Crafts Union Local No. 1 of DE/PA Welfare Fund v. \nEdward Wilkinson Co., Inc ., C.A. No. 07- 145 GMS, 2008 WL 4948654, at *3 (D. Del. Nov. 19, \n2008); see also  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)(D) ; (Tr. at 47) .  Here, having obtained default, Plaintiffs \nare, indeed, the prevailing party in this action.  See Bricklayers , 2008 WL 4948654, at *3. \n In their original proposed Judgment, Plaintiffs were seeking $16,170.75 in attorneys \u2019 fees \nand costs, for the time period up through December 14, 2021.  (D.I. 10 -1 at \u00b6  2-3, 5)  In order to \ndemonstrate the reasonableness of th ose requested fees and costs, Plaintiffs provided:  (1) a list \nshowing all relevant work performed by Plainti ffs\u2019 outside and Delaware counsel , along with \nrelated costs, for the period through December 14, 2021; and (2) declarations from outside and Delaware counsel setting out fact s regarding  the relevant experience of billing counsel and the \nreasonableness of their rates.  (D.I. 11, exs. 8 -11)  The Court has carefully reviewed these \ndocuments, and finds the requested amounts (which are for far less than the amount of other \ndamages sought) to be both reasonable and tied to the work performed in this case.  See United Auto. Workers Local 259 Social Sec. Dept. v. Metro Auto Ctr., 501 F.3d 283, 290- 91 (3d Cir. \n2007); Finkel v. INS Elec. Servs. Inc ., No. 06- CV-4862-  (SLT)(MDG), 2008 WL 941482, at *11 \n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2008); s ee also  (Tr. at 47- 49). \n However, in their amended proposed Judgment, Plaintiffs have now added in a  request \nfor an additional $19,801.18 in attorneys \u2019 fees and costs, without making any showing as to what \nthose fees or costs w ere for (and thus why they are reasonable).  (D.I. 15 at \u00b6\u00b6 2- 3, 5); see also   16 United Auto. Workers Local 259, 501 F.3d at  291 (\u201cIn requesting . . . attorneys\u2019 fees, specificity \nis critical.\u201d) .  The Court will thus not recommend that these fees and costs be awarded now.  \nAccordingly, the Court recommends that the District Court award damages in the amount \nof $16,170.75 for attorneys \u2019 fees and costs.  \nE. Audit  \nLastly, Plaintiffs ask the Court to order that Defendant and its officers, agents, servants, \nemployees, attorneys, and all persons acting on behalf of or in conjunction with Defendant be \nrequired to submit to an audit of its wage, payroll and personnel records  for all periods in which \nDefendant is obligated to contribute to the Plaintiffs , and to do so within 20 days of a demand by \nPlaintiffs.  ( D.I. 14 at 7- 10; D.I. 15 at \u00b6  6)  In their  opening brief, Plaintiffs did not provide any \nexplanation as to the basis for this request , nor as to t he District Court\u2019s authority to order that \nsuch relief be granted .  (D.I. 11)  After the Court inquired about this at the hearing, (Tr. at 49-\n50), Plaintiffs did so in their supplemental brief, (D .I. 14 at 7- 10).   \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated how , in the trust agreements for the Pension Fund, Welfare \nFund and Annuity Fund, the documents each provide that the Board of Trustees for those plans \nhas the power to:  (1) examine /audit Defendant\u2019s payroll  and employment records , in order to \ndetermine compliance with the agreement ; and (2)  have an accountant enter the employer\u2019s \npremises during business hours upon request, for the purpose of inspecting such records and making copies of those records.  (D.I. 11, ex. 2 at Art . V at \u00a7 5.02; id ., ex. 3 at Art . VII at \u00a7 7.25; \nid., ex. 4 at Art. V at \u00a7 5.0 2; see also id ., ex. 5 at \u00b6 13; D.I. 14 at 7- 8)  Additionally, ERISA \nprovides that a court may order \u201csuch other legal or equitable relief\u201d as it deems appropriate to a \nprevailing party, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)(E), and various district courts have  ordered a defendant \nto be subject to such an audit in circumstances  similar to those here , see, e.g., Bd. of Trustees of 17 Laborers \u2019 Dist. Council Constr. Indus. Pension Fund v. VG Concrete, LLC , CIVIL ACTION \nNO. 19- 04642, 2020 WL 610013, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 7, 2020) ; Int\u2019l Union of Operating \nEngineers of E. Pennsylvania & Delaware Benefit Pension Fund v. N. Abbonizio Contractors, \nInc., 134 F. Supp. 3d 862, 867 (E.D. Pa. 2015) ; Gesualdi v. Giacomelli Tile Inc ., No. CV10- 4841 \n(ADS)(WDW), 2011 WL 4352548, a t *2-4 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2011) , report a nd \nrecommendation adopted, 2011 WL 4356157 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2011) .  Additionally, Mr. \nErnsberger explained in his testimony how and why an audit of the requested type will likely uncover additional unpaid contributions owed to Plaintiffs.  (Tr. at 26- 28) \nFor these reasons, the Court recommends that the District Court grant Plaintiffs\u2019 request \nfor an audit in the form sought in the proposed Judgment , for the period of April 2020 through to \nthe present .  (D.I. 1 5 at \u00b6 6)  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor all of the above reasons , the Court recommends that the District Court GRANT -IN-\nPART and DENY- IN-PART  the Motion pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2)  in the manner set out in this \nReport and Recommendation.  After the District Court review s and adjudicates this Report and \nRecommendation, it can then order Plaintiffs to submit a further amended form of Judgment that \nreflects the District Court\u2019s decision on the appropriate amount and type of damages and other relief t hat should be provided a t this time .  The District Court  can then sign that Judgment \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58.   \nPlaintiffs shall serve a copy of this Report and Recommendation on Defendant in the \nsame manner that Plaintiffs served the Defendant with the Com plaint, and shall file proof of such \nservice with the Court.   18 This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.

The parties may serve and file specific written objections \nwithin f ourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).
