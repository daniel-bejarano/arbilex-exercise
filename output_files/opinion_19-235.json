Pro se  Petitioner.   \n Andrew Vella , Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington, Delaware.  \nCounsel for R espondents. \n                   \n February  24, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware  \n 1 \nNOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n Pending before the Court is a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254 filed by P etitioner Robert Moody (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) .  (D.I.  3).  The State filed an A nswer in \nopposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply.  (D.I. 12; D .I. 13) .  The State then filed a Sur -Reply , \nto which Petitioner filed a Response.  (D.I. 15; D.I. 19) .  For the reasons discussed, the Cour t will \ndeny the P etition.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nAround midnight on July 25, 2013, while Wilmington Police Officer \nMatthew Geiser patrolled a high crime neighborhood, he observed [Petitioner]  riding his bicycle with a noticeable bulge around his \nright rear waistline. Based on his training and experience, he \nbelieved [Petitioner]  was armed with a firearm. The officer ordered \n[Petitioner]  to stop and sounded his airhorn.  [Petitioner]  looked \ndirectly at the officer and performed a \u201csecurity check\u201d of his right rear waistline with his hand.  [Petitioner]  sped up and turned down \nan alleyway behind the vacant Walt \u2019s Flavor Crisp store.  \n Officer Geiser intercepted [Petitioner]  at the other end of the alley. \nHe ordered [Petitioner]  to get off his bicycle and noticed [Petitioner] \nno longer had a bulge in his waist line. Officer Geiser and other \nofficers searched the area and arrested [Petitioner]  after finding a \n.357 Magnum loaded with three rounds of ammunition on the roof of one of the buildings that bordered the alley.  \n \nMoody v. State , 133 A.3d 981 (Table), 2016 WL 768353, at *1 (Del. Feb. 26, 2016) . \nIn March 2014, a Delaware  Superior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of carrying a \nconcealed deadly weapon (\u201cCCDW\u201d), possession of a firearm by a person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u2019), \nand possession of ammuniti on by a person prohibited (\u201cPABPP\u201d).  (D.I. 15 at 1) .  On July 24, 2014, \nthe Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to  a total of twenty -one years at Level V imprisonment, \nsuspended after five years for decreasing levels of supervision.  See State v. Moody , 2017 WL \n5952762, at *1 ( Del. Super. Ct. Nov. 30, 2017).  Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware Supreme 2 Court affirmed his convictions  and sentence on February 26, 2016.  See Moody , 2016 WL 768353, \nat *1 . \nIn April 2016, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a motion for postconviction relief \npursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d) .  (D.I. 10- 18 at 139-\n162).  The Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner and postconviction counsel \nfiled an amended Rule 61  motion on Petitioner\u2019s behalf.  (D.I. 10- 20 at 5-33).  The Superior Court \ndenied Petitioner\u2019s amended Rule 61 motion on November 30, 2017.  See Moody , 2017 WL \n5952762, at *4.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on September 24, 2018.  See \nMoody v. State , 195 A.3d 17 (Table), 2018 WL 4676706, at *4 (Del. Sept. 24, 2018).   \nPetitioner was released from prison on January 23, 2018 and began serving the \nprobationary portion of his sentence.  ( D.I. 10- 28 at 5; D.I. 15 at 2) .  His probation officer filed a n \nadministrative warrant on March 29, 2018 charging him with a violation of probation (\u201cVOP\u201d) .  \n(D.I. 15 at 2) .  On April 3, 2018, the Superior Court found Petitioner  in violation of the terms of \nhis probation and sentenced him to seven days of incarcerati on followed by descending levels of \nprobation.  (D.I. 10- 26).  On April 11, 2018, Petitioner was released from prison to serve the \nprobationary portion of his VOP sentence.  (D.I. 10- 28 at 5) .   \nPetitioner\u2019s  probation officer filed an administrative warrant  on November 7, 2018 alleging \nPetitioner violated the terms of his probation by incurring new charges  (drug and firearms \noffenses) .  (D.I. 15 at 2) .  Petitioner was held in default of bail for his new charges and the pending \nVOP.  ( Id. at 3) .  On June 21, 2019, after a hearing, the Superior Court found Petitioner in violation \nof the terms of his probation and discharged him  from Department of Correction  supervision in \nSuperior Court Case ID No. 1307020184 (the subject of the instant habeas Petition).  (D.I . 10-27 \nat 1).  That same day, Petitioner pled guilty in the Superior Court to PFBPP and CCDW in Superior 3 Court case ID No.  1811003124.  The Superior C ourt sentenced Petitioner to seven and one -half \nyears of incarceration, followed by probation.  (D.I. 15 at 21- 25). \nII.   GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES  \nA.   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  \n \n Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \n\u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . . . and to further the \nprinciples of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d  Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003).  \nPursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a ).  AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for \nanalyzing the merits of a habeas petition  in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure \nthat state -court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d  Bell v. Con e, \n535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002).   B.   Exhaustion and Procedural Default  \n Absent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the \npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b);  \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel , 526 U.S. 838, 842- 44 (1999);  Picard v. Connor , 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971).  \nAEDPA states, in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in \ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that \u2013 \n \n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the \ncourts of the State; or  \n \n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective \nprocess; or  (ii) circumstances exist that render such process \nineffective to protect the  rights of the applicant.  \n 4 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).   \n The exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to give \n\u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one  complete \nround of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d   O\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844- 45; Werts \nv. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).  A petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by \ndemonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairl y presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on \ndirect appeal or in a post -conviction proce eding, in a procedural manner permitting the court to \nconsider the  claims on their  merits .  See  Bell v. Cone , 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005) ; Castille v. \nPeoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989) . \n A petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused , and the claims treated as \n\u201ctechnically exhausted\u201d, if state procedural rules preclude him from seeking further relief in state \ncourts .  See  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750- 51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[] the \ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer available); see also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92- 93 (2006).  Although treated as technically exhausted, such \nclaims are procedurally defaulted  for federal habeas purposes .  See Coleman , 501 U.S. at 749 \n(1991); Lines v. Larkins , 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 2000).  Federal courts may not consider the \nmerits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the \nprocedural default and actual prejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of \njustice will result if the court does not review the claims.  See McCandless  v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d \n255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999) ; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750- 51.  To demonstrate cause for a procedural \ndefault, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense impeded \ncounsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d  Murray v. Carri er, 477 U.S. 478, \n488 (1986).  To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that the errors during his trial \ncreated more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that the errors worked to his actual and 5 substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d  Id. at \n494.   \n Alternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has probably \nresulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d Murray , 477 U.S. at 496, then a federal \ncourt can excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  See Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank , \n266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001).  The miscarriage of jus tice exception applies only in \nextraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency.  See \nBousley v. United States , 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998); Murray , 477 U.S. at 496.  A petitioner \nestablishes actual innocence by asser ting \u201cnew reliable evidence -  - whether it be exculpatory \nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence - - that was not \npresented at trial,\u201d showing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner gui lty \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  Hubbard v. Pinchak , 378 F.3d 333, 339- 40 (3d Cir. 2004). \n C.   Standard of Review  \nWhen a state\u2019s highest court has adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits,\n1 the \nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(d).  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state \ncourt\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established \nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision \nwas an unreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the state court \nproceeding.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2);  see Williams v. Taylor , 529 U .S. 362, 412 (2000);   \n \n1    A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) if \nthe state court decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than \non a procedural or some other ground.  See  Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. \n2009).  6 Appel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001).  The deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies \neven when a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has \nbeen denied.  See  Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S. 86, 98- 101 (2011).  As explained by the Supreme \nCourt, \u201cit may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence \nof any indication or state -law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d  Id. at 99. \nA state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court \narrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if \nthe state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set o f materially \nindistinguishable facts.\u201d  Williams , 529 U.S. at 413.  The mere failure to cite Supreme Court \nprecedent does not require a finding that the decision is contrary to clearly established federal law.  See Early v. Packer , 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002).  F or instance, a decision may comport with clearly \nestablished federal law even if the decision does not demonstrate an awareness of relevant Supreme Court cases, \u201cso long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state -court decision contradicts \nthem.\u201d   Id.  In turn, an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law occurs when \na state court \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of a prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d  Williams , 529 U.S. at \n413; see also White v. Woodall , 572 U.S. 415, 426 (2014).   \n Finally, when performing an inquiry under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court must presume that \nthe state court\u2019s determinations of factual issues are correct.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Appel , \n250 F.3d at 210.  This presumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is only rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  See  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(e)(1); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller -El v. Cockrell , \n537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003)(stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to 7 factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual \ndecisions).  \nIII.   DISCUSSION  \nPetitioner\u2019s timely filed habeas Petition  challenges his 2014 convictions for CCDW, \nPFBPP, and PABPP on the following three grounds: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support \nhis convictions  (D.I. 3 at 5) ; (2) the police did not possess reasonable articulable suspicion to stop \nand detain him and,  therefore , violated his Fourth Amendment rights  (D.I. 3 at 7; D.I. 3 -1 at 3 -6); \nand (3) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct  during its closing argument by improperly \nvouching for its case (D.I. 3 at 8) .  \nA.  Mootness  \nPursuant to Arti cle III of the Constitution, federal courts can only consider ongoing cases \nor controversies.  Lewis v. Continental Bank, Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477- 78 (1990);  United States \nv. Kissinger , 309 F.3d 179, 180 (3d Cir. 2002)  (finding that an actual controversy must exist during \nall stages of litigation).  The \u201ccase -or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal \njudicial proceedings,\u201d Lewis, 494 U.S. at 477- 78, and there must be \u201ca live case or controversy at  \nthe time that a federal court decides the case.\u201d  Burke v. Barnes , 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987).  \u201c[T]he \nquestion of mootness is one  . . . which a federal court must resolve before it assumes jurisdiction.\u201d  \nNorth Carolina v. Rice , 404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971).   \nWhen a habeas petitioner challenges his underlying conviction, and he is released during \nthe pendency of his habeas petition, federal courts presume that \u201ca wrongful criminal conviction has continuing collateral consequences\u201d sufficient to satisfy the injury requirement.  Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U.S. 1, 8 (1998); see Steele v. Blackman , 236 F.3d 130, 134 n.4 (3d Cir. 2001).  \nImportantly, collateral consequences will not be presumed when a petitioner does not attack his conviction but, instead, challenges a \u201csentence that has already been served.\u201d  Burkey v. Marberry, 8 556 F.3d 142, 148 (3d Cir. 2009).  In such cases, the collateral consequences must be proven and \nlikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Id. at 148; Spencer , 523 U.S. at 7.  In the \nabsence of continuing collateral consequences, a federal district court does not have jurisdiction \nto review moot habeas claims.  See Rice, 404 U.S. at 246.  \nAs a threshold issue, the State raises the possibility that the instant Petition could be \ndismissed as moot because Petitioner was fully discharged from his probation related to the 2014 \nconvictions in June 2019, and his current custody is due to his conviction on charges in an entirely \ndifferent case.  (D.I. 15 at 4- 7).  The claims in the Petition, however, challen ge the validity of \nPetitioner\u2019s  2014 convictions, and do not  only seek immediate release from custody.  Additionally, \nPetitioner was in custody pursuant to his 2014 convictions when he filed the instant Petition.  \nTherefore, the C ourt presumes that Petitioner\u2019s  2014 convictions have con tinuing collateral \ncircumstances sufficient to satisfy Article III\u2019s case -or-controversy requirement.   \nB.   Claim One:  Sufficiency of the Evidence  \nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends tha t there was insufficient evidence to support his \nconvictions, because the State did not introduce any DNA or fingerprint evidence  at trial.  \nPetitioner also asserts that the officer who discovered the gun on the roof did not know who put it \nthere.  (D.I. 3 at 5) .  Petitioner presented the instant  argument  on direct appeal to the Delaware \nSupreme Court, which denied it as meritless.  Therefor e, Claim One will only warrant relief if the \nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.   \nThe federal law  governing Peti tioner\u2019s insufficient evidence c laim is  that which was \narticulated by the United States Supreme Court in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979).  Pursuant to Jackson , \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of 9 the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  Id.  at 319.  This standard \u201cmust be  applied with explicit \nreference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d  Id.  at 324 \nn.16.  Additionally, \u201ca federal habeas court faced with a record of historical facts that supports \nconflicting inferences must presum e \u2013 even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record \u2013 that \nthe trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that \nresolution.\u201d  Id.  at 326; see also  Gov\u2019t of Virgin Islands v. Isaac , 50 F.3d 1175, 1179 \n(3d Cir. 1995).  R eviewing courts cannot make their  own credibility determinations whe n \nevaluating the suf ficiency of the evidence .  See United States v. Giampa, 758 F.2d 928, 934- 35 \n(3d Cir. 1985).  Finally, \u201c it is not necessary that the evidence exclude ever y reasonable hypothesis \nexcept that of guilt.  Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326.     \nHere, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not cite Jackson  when denying Claim \nOne, it applied a standard that comports with Jackson .  Therefore, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.   See Williams , 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A] \nrun-of-the-mill state -court decision applying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to \nthe facts of a prisoner\u2019s case [does] not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause\u201d).   \nThe Court\u2019s inquiry under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is not over, however, because it must also \ndetermine if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s denial of Claim One  involved an unreasonable \napplication of Jackson .  When addressing Petitioner\u2019s instant  insufficient evidence argument on \ndirect appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed the evidence presented at trial and found:  \n[Petitioner\u2019s] argument relies heavily on factual discrepancies and \nalternative scenarios for how the gun arrived on the roof and \npossible explanations for the bulge in his pants. Such questions of fact are resolved by the jury.  [Petitioner]  also cites Crawley v. State  \nfor the proposition that his proximity to the gun was insufficient to establish possession. In Crawley , police arrested the driver of a U \u2013\nHaul truck and his two passenger s after finding stolen items in the \ntruck. Both passengers had met the driver that day. This Court overturned the passengers \u2019 convictions because there was no 10 evidence presented that they had dominion and control over the \nvehicle or any of the stolen prope rty found inside the truck.  \n This case is distinguishable from Crawley  in that it does not involve \nmultiple defendants or hinge solely on [Petitioner\u2019s] proximity to \nthe gun. Rather, Officer Geiser saw [Petitioner]  with a bulge at his \nwaistline. When Officer Geiser ordered [Petitioner]  to stop, he fled. \nWhen police arrested [Petitioner] , the bulge in his pants \ndisappeared. No one else was in the alley or near where police found the gun. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the State, including all reasonable inferences, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that [Petitioner]  possessed the firearm \nand ammunition. It therefore was not an abuse of discretion for the Superior Court to deny [ Petitioner\u2019s]  motion for a new trial.  \n Moody , 2016 WL 768353, at *2 (cleaned up).  \n \nIn order for a jury to find Petitioner guilty of CCDW, the State had to establish beyond a \nreasonable doubt that Petitioner concealed a firearm \u201cupon or about [his] person w ithout a license \nto do so.\u201d  11 Del. Code \u00a7 1442.  In order for the jury to find Petitioner guilty of PFBPP and \nPABPP, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner knowingly possessed a firearm and ammunition on July 25, 2013.  See 11 D el. Code \u00a7 1448.  Possession of a firearm and \nammunition may be established by actual or constructive possession.  To establish that Petitioner \nconstructively possessed the weapon and ammuni tion, the State had to prove that he: \u201c(1) knew \nthe location of the gun [and ammunition] ; (2) had the ability to exercise dominion and control over \nthe gun [and ammunition] ; and (3) intended to guide the destiny of the gun [and ammunition] .\u201d  \nLecates v. State, 987 A.2d 413, 426 (Del. 2009).  The State can p rove the elements of CCDW and \nPFBPP through circumstantial evidence.  See Ross v. State , 232 A.2d 997, 98 (Del. 1967); Lively \nv. State , 427 A.2d 882, 883 (Del. 1981) ; see also  United States v. Iglesias , 535 F.3d 150, 156 (3d \nCir. 2008)  (explaining \u201cthe government may defeat a sufficiency -of-the-evidence challenge on \ncircumstantial evidence alone.\u201d).     11 The jury in this case was presented with the following evidence .  Officer Geiser testified \nthat he saw Petitioner riding a bicycle with a bulge around hi s right rear waistline.   (D.I. 10 -4 at \n47-66).  Given his training involving the characteristics of an armed gunman, Officer Geiser \nbelieved Petitioner was armed.  When Officer Geiser approached Petitioner, Petitioner looked at \nGeiser and performed a \u201csecu rity check\u201d of the bulge with his hand.  Petitioner continued to ride \nhis bicycle and turned down an alley.  Officer Geiser stopped Petitioner at the other end of the \nalley and ordered him off the bicycle.  At this point, Petitioner did not have a bulge in his rear \nwaistline.  Officer Geiser searched the area with other officers and discovered a loaded handgun on the roof of one of the buildings adjacent to the alley.  Officer Geiser immediately arrested Petitioner.   (Id.).  The jury was also informed about  the parties\u2019 stipulation  that Petitioner was \nprohibited by law from possessing, owning, or controlling a firearm and/or deadly weapon.  (D.I.  10-4 at 74) . \nIn summary , the State proved all three elements of constructive possession through its \npresentation of the following facts .  By grabbing the bulge at his waistline, Petitioner \nacknowledged he knew the location of the gun and exercised control over it.  By throwing the gun on a roof in the alley while evading police, Petitioner intended to guide the destiny of the gun.  \nAfter  viewing the aforementioned evidence in a light most favorabl e to the State, the C ourt \nconcludes that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the instant insufficient evidence claim did \nnot involve an unreasonable  application of Jackson .  Accordingly, the C ourt will deny Claim One \nfor failing to satisfy the standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(1).  \n C.   Claim Two: Fourth Amendment Violation  \nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the gun should not have been entered as evidence \nduring the trial because the police lacked  reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop him .  The \nState properly argues that this  Fourth Amendment Claim is not cognizable on federal habeas 12 review under the doctrine established in Stone v. Powell , 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976) .  (See D.I. 15 \nat 17-18)   \nIn Stone , the Supreme Court held that a federal court cannot review a  Fourth Amendment \nclaim if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim in the state court.  See \nalso Wright v. West , 505 U.S. 277, 293 (1992).  A petitioner is considered to have had a full and \nfair opportunity to litigate such clai ms if the state has an available mechanism for suppressing \nevidence seized in or tainted by an illegal search or seizure, irrespective of whether the petitioner \nactually availed himself of that mechanism.  See U.S. ex rel. Hickey v. Jeffes , 571 F.2d 762, 766 \n(3d Cir. 1978); Boyd v. Mintz , 631 F.2d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 1980).  Conversely, a petitioner has not \nhad a full and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, and therefore avoids the Stone  bar, if the state system contains a structural defect  that prevented the state court from fully \nand fairly hearing the petitioner \u2019s Fourth Amendment argument .  See Marshall v. Hendricks , \n307 F.3d 36, 82 (3d Cir. 2002).  Notably, \u201c an erroneous or summary resolution by a state court of \na Fourth Amendment claim  does not overcome the [ Stone ] bar.\u201d  Id. \nRule 41 of the Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rules authorizes a defendant to file a \npre-trial motion to suppress evidence, thereby providing a mechanism for presenting Fourth \nAmendment issues to the Delaware Sta te Courts.  Consequently, no structural defect in Delaware \u2019s \nsystem prevented P etitioner from litigating Claim Two .  Additionally, the fact that P etitioner \u2019s \ndefense counsel did not file a motion to suppress  the gun is immaterial to Stone \u2019s \u201cfull and fair \nopportunity\u201d analysis because it does not constitute a structural defect.  See, e.g., Marshall , \n307 F.3d at 82; Gilmore v. Marks , 799 F.2d 51, 56 (3d Cir. 1986) .  Accordingly, the C ourt will \ndeny Claim Two  as barred by Stone . \n  13 D.   Claim Three: Prosecutorial Misconduct  \nIn his final Claim, Petitioner contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the \nState\u2019s case during closing argument by making the following comment on the reasonable doubt \nstandard : \u201cWhat\u2019s reasonable \u2013 what\u2019s reasonable beyond a reasonable doubt is that [Petitioner] \nhad that firearm.  He knew he was prohibited.  He knew h e couldn\u2019t have it.\u201d  (D.I. 3- 1 at 110, \np. 148) .  Although t he record reveals that  Petitioner did not present Claim Three to the Delaware \nSupreme Court on direct or post -conviction appeal , the Court provides the following additional \ninformation for context.  On direct appeal, defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw and a  Rule \n26(c) no -merits brief.  (D.I. 10- 2).  Petitioner presented Claim Three as an exhibit to the no- merits \nbrief.  (D.I. 10- 3 at 21 -22).  After reviewing the no- merits brief, the Delaware Supreme Court \n\u201ccould not conclude that [Petit ioner\u2019s] appeal [was] wholly without merit and devoid of any \narguabl y appealable issue.\u201d   (D.I. 10- 8 at 3- 4).  Consequently, the Delaware Supreme Court \ngranted defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, but appointed substitute counsel to represent \nPetitioner on direct appeal and directed substitute counsel \u201cto brief any issues presented by the \nrecord that he deems to have arguable merit, including the issue of whether the arresting officer \nhad probable caus e to stop and arrest [Petitioner], and any other issue raised in [Petitioner\u2019s] \nresponse to his former couns el\u2019s motion to withdraw.\u201d   (D.I. 10- 8 at 4) .  Substitute counsel did not \ninclude  Claim Three in the Corrected Opening Brief that was presented to th e Delaware Supreme \nCourt.  (D.I. 10- 9).  Petitioner also did not reassert Claim Three in his Rule 61 proceeding, nor did \nhe raise a claim alleging that substitute counsel was ineffective for failing to raise Claim Three on \ndirect appeal.  Given these circu mstances, the Court concludes that Petitioner did not exhaust state \nremedies for Claim Three.  \nAt this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to raise Claim Three in a Rule 61 motion would \nbe barred as untimely under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i) (1) and as procedurally 14 defaulted under 61(i)(3) due to his failure to present the issue on direct appeal .  See Small v. Pierce, \n226 F. Supp. 3d 299, 318 (D. Del. 2016).  Because there is no indication that Rule 61(d)(2) and \n(i)(5)\u2019s exceptions to the bars in Rule s 61(i)(1 ) and 61(i)(3)  apply in this case,2 any attempt to \nexhaust state remedies would be futile.  Given this futility, the Court must treat Claim Three  as \ntechnically exhausted but procedurally defaulted.  Therefore, the Court cannot review  the merits \nof the instant Claim  absent a showing of cause and prejudice, or that a miscarriage of justice will \nresult absent such review.  \nPetitioner attempts to establish cause by blaming substitute appellate counsel for not raising \nClaim Three to the De laware Supreme Court on direct appeal.  Although an attorney\u2019s error can \nconstitute cause for a procedural default, the petitioner must have first presented that ineffective \nassistance of counsel claim to the state courts as an independent claim and where it  was determined \nthat the attorney\u2019s error amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance.  See Murray, 477 U.S. \nat 488- 89.  Here, Petitioner never presented an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on \nsubstitute appellate counsel\u2019s  failure to raise a prosecutorial misconduct claim  in his state collateral \nproceeding or in his subsequent post -conviction appeal.  (D.I. 1 0-18 at 139- 157; D.I. 10 -20 at 5-\n33; D.I. 10- 16).  Consequently, this ineffective assistance of counsel allegation is itself \nprocedurally defaulted,3 see Del. Super. Ct. Crim. Rule 61(i)(2), and cannot  excuse Petitioner\u2019s \n \n2  Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(d)(2) and (i)(5) provide that the procedural bars \nto relief in Rule 61(i)(1), (2), (3), and (4) do not apply to a claim that the court lacked jurisdiction or if the petitioner pleads with particularity either that (1) new evidence exists that creates a strong inference that he is actually innocent or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive on collateral review, applies to his case and renders his conviction invalid.  See Del. Supe r. Ct. Cr. R. 61(d)(2) and (i)(5).  Petitioner does not allege a valid \nclaim of actual innocence, and he does not allege a lack of jurisdiction or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to  Claim Three.  \n \n3  Petitioner does not a rgue that post -conviction counsel was ineffective for failing to raise  \nthe issue of  substi tute appellate counsel\u2019s failure to include Claim Three on direct appeal.  15 procedural default of the substantive  prosecutorial misconduct  claim.  See Edwards v. Carpenter , \n529 U.S. 446, 453- 54 (2000).   \nIn the absence of cause, the Court need not address prejudice.   The miscarriage of justice \nexception to the procedural default doctrine also does not excuse Petitioner\u2019s default, because \nPetitioner has not provided new reliable evidence of his actual innocence.   Accordingly, the Court \nwill deny Claim Three as procedurally  barred from habeas review.  \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY  \n When a district court issues a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition, the court must also \ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011).  A certificate \nof appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2);  Slack v. \nMcDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).  If a federal court denies a habeas petition on procedural \ngrounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling.  Id.   The Court has concluded that the instant Petition fails to warrant federal habeas relief, and \nis persuaded that reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable.  Therefore, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.  \n  \n \nTherefore, the Court does  not a ddress the applicability of the limited exception to the  \nprocedural  default doctrine established in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012) . 16 V.   CONCL USION \n For the reasons stated, t he Court will deny the  instant Petition for habeas  relief pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 without an evidentiary hearing or the issuance of a certificate of appealability.  \nAn appropriate O rder shall issue.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nROBERT MOODY,  \n \n   Petitioner,  \n  v. \n TRUMAN MEARS, Warden, and ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,  \n \n   Respondents.  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n)  \n   C.A.
