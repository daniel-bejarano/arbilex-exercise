R. Civ. P. 25(d) Chad Wolf and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, who \nwere sued in their official capacities, are substituted as Defendants: Alejandro \nMayorkas replaces Chad Wolf as Secretary, Department of Homeland Security; \nand Ur Mendoza Jaddou replaces Kenneth T. Cuccinelli as Director, United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services. COLM F.0NNOLLY \nCHIEF JUDGE \nPlaintiff Jeremy F. Ahlijah, who appears prose, challenges in his four-count \nComplaint (D.I. 2) several decisions by the Department of Homeland Security's \n(OHS) United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its \npredecessor agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). {The \nINS, an agency of the United States Department of Justice, was dissolved in March \n2003, and its responsibilities were distributed among the USCIS, the U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection. USCIS History Office & Library, Overview of INS History 11, \nUSCIS (2012), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/fact\u00ad\nsheets/INSHistory. pdf.) Pending before me is Defendants' motion to dismiss \nCounts I, II, and IV of the Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (D.I. \n16). The motion is fully briefed, and no hearing is necessary. \nI. BACKGROUND \nAhlijah is a native and citizen of Cameroon. He arrived in the United \nStates in 1981 on a B-2 tourism visa and obtained in 1984 an F-1 temporary \nnonimmigrant student visa that allowed him to attend school in the United States. \nD.I. 2-1 at 10; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 110l{a){l5)(F)(i) and (a)(15)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 \n214.2(b )( 1) and (f)( 6). \n1 It is undisputed that on June 7, 2018, the Immigration Court issued an \nInterim Order for removal of Ahlijah to Cameroon, that Ahlijah appealed that order \non June 29, 2018 to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and that his appeal \nremains pending. D.I. 16 at 9; D.I. 19 at 12 (arguing that the initiation of removal \nproceedings violated Ahlijah's due process rights). \nThe three counts of the Complaint that are the subject of the pending motion \narise out of forms Ahlijah submitted many years ago either to USCIS or INS. \nIn 1991, Ahlijah submitted a Form 1-687 to INS, seeking temporary resident \nstatus under Section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). D.I. 2-\n1 at 4. Alijah claimed that he was entitled to temporary resident status pursuant \nto a settlement agreement USCIS entered in to in connection with the class action \nlawsuit titled League of United Latin American Citizens v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) (LULAC). Id. By letter dated January 15, 2002, \nINS denied Ahlijah's application due to insufficient evidence that Ahlijah met the \nLULAC class's inclusion requirements. D.I. 2-1 at 23. In Count I of the \nComplaint, Ahlijah alleges that Defendants improperly rejected his Form 1-687 in \nviolation of the Administrative Procedures Act {AP A) and the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment by affording no opportunity to appeal, by acting in an \narbitrary manner, and by providing inadequate notice. D.I. 2 at 3-8. \nOn September 19, 2008, Ahlijah filed a Form 1-485, seeking permanent \n2 resident status under Section 245 of the INA. D.I. 2-2 at 2; D.I. 16 at 3. By \nletter dated August 27, 2009, USCIS denied Ahlijah's claim based on its finding \nthat Ahlijah had been convicted of\"a crime involving moral turpitude.\" D.I. 2-2 \nat 4. In Count II of the Complaint, Ahlijah alleges that Defendants improperly \ndenied his Form 1-485 in violation of the APA and the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment by failing to follow Defendants' own non-discretionary policies \nand procedures. D.I. 2 at 8-12. \nFinally, in August 2013, Ahlijah filed a Form 1-918, seeking U \nNonimmigrant Status. D.I. 2-4 at 2; D.I. 16 at 3. Form 1-918 permits victims \n\"of certain qualifying criminal activity\" to \"request temporary immigration \nbenefits .... \" Instructions for Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status and \nSupplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, U.S. \nDept. of Homeland Security (Dec. 6, 2021 ), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/I-918instr.pdf. In \nCount IV, Ahlijah appears to demand that Defendants produce evidence to confirm \nthat he withdrew his Form 1-918 Petition. D.I. 2 at 15. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Rule 12(b)(l) \nA federal court \"generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first \ndetermining that it has jurisdiction over the category of claim in suit (subject-\n3 matter jurisdiction).\" Sinochem Int'/ Co. Ltd. v. Malaysia Int'/ Shipping Corp., \n549 U.S. 422, 430-31 (2007). Dismissal is appropriate under Rule 12(b )(1) when \nthe district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(l). \nOnce a court's jurisdiction is challenged, it must presume that it lacks \njurisdiction unless the party asserting that jurisdiction exists can prove otherwise. \nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375,377 (1994); Wells v. \nKing, 340 F. App'x 57, 58 (3d Cir. 2009) (citing Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377). \nThe requirement that a plaintiff establish subject matter jurisdiction \"'spring[s] \nfrom the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States' and is \n'inflexible and without exception.\"' Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env 't, 523 \nU.S. 83, 95 (1998) (quoting Mansfield, C. & L.MR. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, \n382 (1884)); see also United States v. Thomas, 713 F.3d 165, 168 (3d Cir. 2013) \n(citing Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 94-95). A motion to dismiss for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b )( 1) is characterized as either a \"facial\" attack, \ni.e., the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction, \nor as a \"factual\" attack, i.e., the facts in the complaint supporting subject matter \njurisdiction are questioned. Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F .3d 333, 346 (3d Cir. \n2016); Mortensen v. First Federal Sav. and Loan Ass 'n, 549 F .2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. \n1977). In a factual attack, such as here, the court may consider any evidence \n4 submitted by the parties that is relevant to the issue of jurisdiction. Davis, 824 \nF.3d at 346 (\"[A] factual challenge allows 'a court [to] weigh and consider \nevidence outside the pleadings.\"' (quoting Constitution Party of Pa. v. Aichele, 757 \nF.3d 347,358 (3d Cir. 2014)). In such cases, \"no presumptive truthfulness \nattaches to plaintiffs allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will \nnot preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional \nclaims. Moreover, the plaintiff will have the burden of proof that jurisdiction \ndoes in fact exist.\" Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass 'n, 549 F .2d 884, \n891 (3d Cir. 1977); see also Davis, 824 F.3d at 346 (quoting Mortensen, 549 F.2d \nat 891). \nB. TheAPA \n\"It is elementary that the United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit \nsave as it consents to be sued, and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court \ndefine that court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit. A waiver of sovereign \nimmunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.\" United States \nv. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980). \nThe AP A provides for limited waiver of sovereign immunity and judicial \nreview of agency actions. Under the AP A, a federal court may review only \"final \nagency action[s] for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court .... \" \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. An agency action is final when it is the \"consummation of the \n5 agency's decisionmaking process,\" and when \"rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\" Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal quotes and citations omitted); see also Jie Fang \nv. Dir. United States Immigr. & Customs Enf't, 935 F .3d 172, 180 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(same). \"If there remain[s] a step ... to have an action reviewed within the \nagency, then the action is not final and judicial review is premature.\" Pinho v. \nGonzales, 432 F .3d 193, 200 (3d Cir. 2005). When a plaintiff seeks review in the \ndistrict court of a nonfinal agency action, the court must dismiss the matter for lack \nof subject matter jurisdiction. See Naik v. Dir. US. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs. \nVermont, 575 F. App'x 88, 92 (3d Cir. 2014) (\"Accordingly, ... there is no final \nagency action, and the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\"); \nInvention Submission Corp. v. Rogan, 357 F.3d 452,460 (4th Cir. 2004) (similar). \nC. Mandamus \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 \"[t]he district courts shall have original \njurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or \nemployee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the \nplaintiff.\" Mandamus relief is generally considered \"a drastic one, to be invoked \nonly in extraordinary situations\" where government officials have clearly failed to \nperform nondiscretionary duties. Kerr v. US. District Court, 426 U.S. 394,402 \n(1976); see also Cheney v. United States Dist. Ct.for Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. \n6 367,380 (2004). To obtain mandamus relief, a plaintiff must demonstrate the lack \nof any other adequate remedy. Mallard v. U.S. District Court for So. District of \nIowa, 490 U.S. 296,309 (1989); see also Mote v. United States Dist. Ct.for Middle \nDist. of Pennsylvania, 858 F. App'x 39, 40 (3d Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. \n906 (2022) (\"A party seeking a writ of mandamus must show that he has (i) no \nother adequate means of obtaining the desired relief .... \"). Additionally, writs of \nmandamus are only available to compel \"a legal duty which is a specific, plain \nministerial act devoid of the exercise of judgment or discretion.\" Harmon Cove \nCondominium Ass 'n, Inc. v. Marsh, 815 F .2d 949, 951 (3d Cir. 1987). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Jurisdiction Under the APA \n1. Count I \nCount I seeks judicial review of Defendants' temporary resident status \nrejection under\u00a7 245A of Ahlijah's Form 1-687. Section 245A permits federal \ncourts to review a denial of an adjustment of an immigrant's status \"only in the \njudicial review of an order of deportation .... \" 8 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1255a(f)( 1 ), \n(f)(4)(A) (referencing 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a (West Sept. 29, 1996)); see also Qureshi \nv. Admin. Appeals Off. (AAO) of USCIS, 408 F. App'x 611,613 (3d Cir. 2010). \nSince the 2002 letter is not a final deportation order, Ahlijah cannot seek judicial \nreview of the INS's temporary resident status determination. Indeed, Ahlijah \n7 cannot appeal from a final deportation order because he is still in removal \nproceedings and the BIA has not yet issued a final order. (Moreover, any appeal \nfrom a final deportation order would lie with the Third Circuit, not this Court. 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5).) \nAhlijah argues that I have jurisdiction over Count I under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1255a(f)(4)(C). D.I. 19 at 9. But he is wrong. Section 1255a(f)(4)(C) provides: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court \nshall have jurisdiction of any cause of action or claim by \nor on behalf of any person asserting an interest under this \nsection unless such person in fact filed an application \nunder this section within the period specified by \nsubsection ( a)(l ), or attempted to file a complete \napplication and application fee with an authorized \nlegalization officer of the Service but had the application \nand fee refused by that officer. \nThus,\u00a7 1255a(f)(4)(C) is an additional limitation on judicial review, not an \nindependent basis for jurisdiction. \nAhlijah is similarly incorrect that McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., \n498 U.S. 479 (1991) gives rise to jurisdiction over Count I. See D.I. 19 at 9. The \nCourt was explicit in McNary that its holding \"relate[ d] only to the SAW [\"special \nagricultural workers\" lawfully admitted for temporary residence status] amnesty \nprogram.\" 498 U.S. at 483. The Court held in McNary that a district court could \n\"exercis[ e] general federal-question jurisdiction over an action alleging a pattern or \npractice of procedural due process violations by [INS] in its administration of the \n8 SAW program.\" Id. Thus, McNary has no relevance here. Ahlijah is not a \nspecial agricultural worker and, in any event, he has not alleged a pattern or \npractice of due process violations by INS or USCIS. \n2. Count II \nCount II seeks review ofUSCIS's 2009 denial under\u00a7 245 of Ahlijah's \nForm I-485 request for adjustment of residency status. Ahlijah, however, may \nseek agency review of this denial in his pending removal proceedings. See Jie \nFang, 935 F .3d at 182 (holding that \"removal proceedings empower[ ] the \nimmigration judge to exercise de novo review over applications for adjustment of \nstatus\"). Accordingly, since there remains a step for Ahlijah to have the denial \nreviewed by the BIA, the denial is not a final order over which this court has \njurisdiction. Pinho, 432 F.3d at 200; see also Jie Fang, 935 F.3d at 182 \n(summarizing and quoting with approval the conclusion of the Ninth Circuit in \nCabaccang v. US. Citizenship & Immigration Services., 627 F.3d 1313 (9th Cir. \n2010), that \"the denial of status adjustment [is] not final because the immigration \njudge overseeing the pending removal proceedings ha[s] the power to 'completely \nwipe away [the] USCIS's prior decision' to deny Cabaccang's adjustment-of-status \nrequest.\"). \n3. Count IV \nCount IV reads as follows: \n9 D.I. 2 at 15. On August 14, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Petition for U\u00ad\nNonimmigrant Visa (Form 1-918). On June 5, 2015 \nDefendant[ s] requested additional evidence for Plaintiffs \nU-Nonimmigrant Visa (Form 1-918). Defendant[s] \nalleged that it will take 60 days to respond to Plaintiffs \napplication request. See Exhibit D-1 [D.I. 2-4]. \nHowever, Plaintiff waited for two (2) years and on June \n28, 2017 he receive[ d] a notice from USICS alleging that \nhe supposedly withdrew his application, and there was no \nappeal or motion right. See Exhibit D-2 Defendant June \n28, 2017 Decision [D.I. 2-4 at 8]. With that, Plaintiff \nrequested Defendant[ s] to provide evidence to support \n[their] allegation that he has requested for the withdrawal \nof his Form 1-918 application. See Exhibit D-3, \nRequest/or Evidence [D.I. 2-4 at 10-11]. As of today, \nJanuary 15, 2020, Plaintiff still has not received any such \nevidence that Defendant[ s] alleged Plaintiff directed \nthem to withdraw his petition. The reason is because \nthe Defendant[s] evidently circumvented that allegation \nin o[rd]er to deny Plaintiff his Form 1-918 Petition. \nConsequently, Defendant[s] abuse[d] [their] discretion in \nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)-(B), by arbitrarily alleging that \nPlaintiff withdrew his Form 1-918 petition without \nproviding any evidence to support their claim. \nDefendants submitted with their motion a copy of Ahlijah's November 12, \n2015 letter to USCIS in which he \"respectfully request[ ed] ... to withdraw [his] \nForm 1-918 Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status\" so that he could \"seek relief o[f] \n[his] Adjustment of status at [his] removal proceeding.\" D.I. 16-1. Ahlijah did \nnot address Count IV or Defendants' arguments to dismiss Count IV anywhere in \nthe 78 pages of briefing he filed in oppositions to Defendants' motion. See D.I. \n10 18; D.I. 19; D.I. 22. He does not dispute that he withdrew his Form 1-918 Petition \nin November 2015. \nI read Count IV as a claim seeking an order to require Defendants to produce \nto Ahlijah a copy of the withdrawal of his Form 1-918 Petition. That reading is \nconfirmed by the fact that Ahlijah did not respond to Defendants' arguments \nrelated to Count IV in his opposition briefing after Defendants provided him a \ncopy of the withdrawal letter. See D.I. 19; D.I. 22. Count IV is therefore moot, \nand, there no longer being a controversy about the withdrawal letter, I will dismiss \nCount IV for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., \n568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) (\"A case becomes moot-and therefore no longer a 'Case' \nor 'Controversy' for purposes of Article III-when the issues presented are no \nlonger 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\" \n( citation and some internal quotation marks omitted)). \nB. Mandamus Jurisdiction \nAs discussed above, Ahlij ah may seek review of the denial of his requests \nfor adjustments of status in removal proceedings or in judicial review thereof. 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1255a(f)(l), (f)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(5)(ii). And he has already \nobtained the relief he sought in Count IV. Because, with respect to Counts I and \nII, Ahlijah has other forms of relief available to him, this Court lacks mandamus \njurisdiction. Mallard, 490 U.S. at 309. \n11 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I will grant Defendants' motion to dismiss \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction and will dismiss Counts I, II, and IV.2 \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n2 Defendants also argued in their motion that Counts I and II should be dismissed \nas time barred. D.I. 16 at 8, 11. I need not address those arguments since I lack \njurisdiction over Counts I and II. \n12 "}
