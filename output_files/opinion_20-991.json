No. 20-991-LPS\nSARAH VANES, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nKelly E.S. Aliahmed, Sussex Correctional Institution, Georgetown, Delaware, and Mohamed\nAliahmed, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiffs.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMay 27, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nLA) /]\nSTARK, U.S. Circuit Judge:\nL INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiffs Kelly E. S. Aliahmed (\u201cK. Aliahmed\u201d), an inmate at the Sussex Correctional\nInstitution in Georgetown, Delaware,' and Mohamed Aliahmed (\u201cM. Aliahmed\u201d), an inmate at the\nJames T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, Delaware (together \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), filed this action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.7 (D.I. 1) Both Plaintiffs appear pro se and K. Aliahmed has been\ngranted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 7) The Court proceeds to review and screen the\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action swa sponte under the screening provisions of\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from\nsuch relief.\u201d Ball v. Famigho, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915()(2) (\u00e9# forma\npauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison conditions). The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most\nfavorable to a pro se plaintiff. See Philips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008);\n\nEnckson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiffs proceed prv se, their pleading is liberally\n\n'K. Aliahmed was housed at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, Delaware, when\nshe commenced this action.\n\n? When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived her of a\nfederal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law. See\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\n\n1\nconstrued and the Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See Dooley \u00bb.\nWetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke \u00bb. Wiliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see\nalso Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or\ndelusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d\u201d Dooley \u00bb. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d\n523, 530 (2003) and Neityke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) Gi) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule\n12(b)(6) motions. See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(6)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state claim under { 1915(e)(2)(B)). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant a\nPlaintiff leave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson \u00bb. Mayview\nState Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Be// Atl Corp. v. Twombly, 550\nU.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do\nmore than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a\ncause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to\n\n2\nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Wilkams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306,\n315 (Gd Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).\nFinally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See\nJobnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect\nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly and Igbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency\nof a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the Court should\nassume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\nSee Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged\nwhen the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See Igba/, 556 U.S. at\n679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific\ntask that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id.\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. 42 U.S.C. 1983\n\nThe Complaint names 26 Defendants, contains numerous claims, and seeks compensatory\nand injunctive relief. Plaintiffs allege malpractice, deliberate indifference to medical needs,\nconspiracy, retaliation, religious harm, physical and verbal abuse, destruction of property, marital\nattacks, and denial of treatment programs.\n\nLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature, and to be liable, a defendant must\nhave been personally involved in the wrongful conduct. In other words, defendants are \u201cliable only\nfor their own unconstitutional conduct.\u201d Barkes v. First Corr. Med., Inc., 766 F.3d 307, 316 (3d Cir.\n\n3\n2014), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Taylor v. Barkes, 135 S.Ct. 2042 (2015). \u201cBecause vicarious liability\nis inapplicable to . . . \u00a7 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant,\nthrough the official\u2019s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\u201d Igba/, 556 U.S. at 676.\n\nThe allegations here are insufficient to state a civil rights action against Defendants. The\nComplaint does not sufficiently allege each defendants\u2019 personal involvement in any of the alleged\nviolations. Instead, the Complaint raises the claims in a conclusory manner without facts, such as\nwhen, where, or how the alleged violations occurred. See Pettis \u00bb. Everhart, 2021 WL 1664111, at *1\n(3d Cir. Apr. 28, 2021) (citing Kaucher v. County of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201cTo state a\n\u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant, acting under color of state law, deprived\nhim or her of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.\u201d); Evancho \u00bb.\nFisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005) (civil rights complaint must allege facts identifying the\n\u201cconduct, time, place, and persons responsible\u201d); Rode 2. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.\n1988) (plaintiff cannot rely solely on respondeat superior as theory of liability). Merely reciting an\nelement of a cause of action or making a bare conclusory statement is insufficient to state a claim.\nSee Igbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n\nIn addition, the Complaint refers to \u201cdefendants\u201d with footnotes that name Defendant(s) for\neach claim, but the allegations do not refer to specific actions taken by a particular defendant.\nFinally, in the few instances where the body of the Complaint refers to actions taken by a specific\ndefendant, the Complaint does not indicate when the alleged wrongful acts took place. (See eg., D.1.\n1 at Jf 12, 20 (alleging Heidi Holloway interfered with K. Aliahmed\u2019s early release and placement in\ntreatment programs); id. J 20 (alleging Deputy Attorney General George Lees advised his client to \u00a9\n\ndeny K. Aliahmed\u2019s rights during disciplinary proceedings))\nBecause the Complaint does not meet the pleading requirements of Igba/ and Twombly, it will\nbe dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(6)(1). Plaintiffs will be given leave\nto amend.\n\nB. M. Aliahmed\n\nM. Aliahmed is a pro se litigant who is presently incarcerated, and who filed this action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 without prepayment of the filing fee or a request to proceed in forma\npauperis. M. Aliahmed will be ordered to submit a request to proceed in forma pauperis and a certified\ncopy of his prison trust fund account statement.\nIv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss the Complaint as frivolous and for failure\nto state claims upon which relief may be granted pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(\u20ac)(2)(B)@ and (i) and\n1915A(b)(1); and (2) require M. Aliahmed to submit a request to proceed in forma pauperis and a\ncertified copy of his prison trust fund account statement. Plaintiffs will be given leave to file an\namended complaint.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nKELLY E.S. ALIAHMED and\nMOHAMED ALIAHMED,\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nv. ; Civ. No. 20-991-LPS\n\nSARAH VANES, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this 27\" day of May, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion issued\nthis date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1.

Both\nPlaintiffs are required to file a signature page to the Amended Complaint. The case will be closed\nshould Plaintiffs fail to timely file a second amended complaint.\n\n2.
