{"case_name": "TQ Delta LLC v. Time Warner Cable Inc., et al.", "case_number": "15-615", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "11-22-2022", "ocr_text": "TQ DELTA LLC, \nV. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 15-615-RGA \nTIME WARNER CABLE INC., et al., \nDefendants . \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. (D.I. 537). It is opposed. (D.I. 539). \nThe order that Plaintiff wants me to reconsider sustained the Special Master's Order #19. (D.I. \n533). \nMotions to reconsider are sparingly granted. Plaintiff says I made four mistakes in my \ntwo-page order. Plaintiff says the result is manifest injustice to Plaintiff. \nI do not believe that the order is full of mistakes. First, it is not erroneous to say that \nPlaintiff could have taken the appropriate discovery in the DISH case. Plaintiff says it had no \nreason to take the discovery in the DISH case. It took the discovery in the TWC case; it could \nhave taken it in the DISH case. It simply did not. Second, Plaintiff argues that it is wrong to say \nthe discovery is irrelevant to the TWC case. It bases this conclusion in part on the argument that \nTWC may renege on an agreement that it made long before the deposition in question and which \nit has reconfirmed numerous times since. In other words, Plaintiffs theory as to why the \nevidence is relevant in TWC's case is conditioned on TWC backing out of an agreement that it \nappears it is not possible for TWC to back out of even if it were so inclined to try. Plaintiff's \nPage I of :2 other relevance theory is not that the evidence is somehow relevant to the TWC case in the \nnormal sense of relevance (that is, that it would be admissible in connection with some disputed \nissue), but that not permitting the evidence to be disclosed would help DISH accomplish an end \nthat would work to TWC's benefit. That is not the usual meaning of \"relevance\" in the context \noflitigation. Third, the parties have made a record of what the noticed topic was. (D.I. 537 at 5-\n6; D.I. 539 at 2-3). Plaintiff has not convinced me that there was any error in my previous order \nin regard to whether the topic of joint defense agreements was clearly noticed. Fourth, I continue \nto believe that the Rule 30(b)(6) testimony would not be admissible at a hearing in the DISH \ncase where the rules of evidence applied. 1 \nFor the above reasons, the motion for reconsideration (D.I. 537) is DENIED . \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 22nd day of November 2022. \n1 An issue of the extent ofIPR estoppel is not a jury issue. \nPage 2 of 2 "}
