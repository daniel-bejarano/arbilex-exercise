DUFFY, SR. ,    : \n      : \n   Petitioner,   : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 21- 1418- RGA  \n      : \nTRUMAN MEARS , Warden, and   : \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE   : \nSTATE OF DELAWARE,    : \n      : \n   Respondent .   : \n______________________________________________________________________________    \nMEMORANDUM  \nI. BACKGROUND   \n On July 8, 1985, Petitioner pled guilty to one count of first degree rape .  See Duffy v. \nState , 513 A.2d 1318 (Table), 1986 WL 17363, at *1 (Del. July 31, 1986) .  The Delaware \nSuperior Court sentenced him to a natural life term of imprisonment, with the first twenty years \nbeing mandatory.  Id .  Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss his guilty plea, which the Superior \nCourt denied.  See Duffy v. State , 536 A.2d 615 (Table), 1987 WL 31556, at *1 (Del. Dec. 21, \n1987).  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision.  Id . at *3.  \n On August 18, 1986, Petitioner filed in this Court a petition for federal habeas relief, \nasserting: (1) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance; (2) his guilty plea was involuntary; \n(3) his conviction was obtained by using a coerced confession; and (4) his conviction was obtained by using evidence that was unlawfully seized.  See Duffy v. Mears , 2020 WL 5258435, \nat *1 (D. Del. Sept. 3, 2020).  On March 3, 1987, the  Court  denied the petition as meritless.  See \nid.  The Third Circuit denied a certificate of probable cause for Petitioner\u2019s appeal on April 17, \n1987, and later denied Petitioner\u2019s sur -petition for rehearing on May 8, 1987.  See id .   2 \n  Thereafter, Petitioner filed numerous unsuccessful postconviction motions in the \nDelaware state courts.  See, e.g., Duffy v. State , 53 A.3d 301 (Table), 2012 WL 4019037, at *1 \n(Del.  Sept. 12, 2012).  Petitioner filed another federal habeas petition in April 2019, which \nasserted the following five grounds for relief: (1) his  natural life  sentence is unconstitutional and \nillegal, and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment ; (2) defense counsel provided ineffective \nassistance during the original criminal proceeding ; (3) his guilty plea was coerced and \ninvoluntary; (4) he was erroneously informed that he was being sentenced to a life sentence \ndefined as a fixed 45 years with the first 20 years mandatory, not natural life; and (5) legislation \npassed by the Delaware General Assembly in 2016 amending 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4214, along with the decision in Rauf v. State , 145 A.3d 430 (Del. 2016), supports his argument that his natural \nlife sentence is unconstitutional, and he should be sentenced to time -served.   See Duffy , 2020 WL \n5258435, at *2.  The Court dismisse d Petitioner\u2019s 2019 as  second or successive and, \nalternatively, as time -barred .  See id. at *2- 5.  \n In October 2021, Petitioner filed the habeas Petition presently pending before the Court, \nasking the Court to sentence him to \u201ctime served\u201d for his 1985 Delaware conviction for rape.  \n(D.I. 1 at 1)  He  contends  that his 37- year-old sentence for natural life is unconstitutional  because \nit constitutes a capital sentence for a non -capital offense (D.I. 3 at 5), and he argues that the \nDelaware Supreme Court erroneously denied his petition for writ of certiorari that challenged his \nlife sentence for his 1985 rape conviction on the same ground.  See Matter of Duffy , 251 A.3d \n661 (Table), 2021 WL 1733296, at *1- 2 (Del. Apr. 30, 2021).    \n  3 \n II.   LEGAL STANDARDS  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)( 3)(A ), a petitioner must seek authorization from the \nappropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive habeas petition in a district \ncourt.  See Burton v. Stewart , 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007) ; Rule 9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.    A  \npetition for habeas relief is not considered to be \u201csecond or successive simply because it follows \nan earlier federal petition.\u201d  Benchoff v. Colleran , 404 F.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 2005) .  Rather, a  \nhabeas petition is classified as second or successive within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 if a \nprior petition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new petitions challenge the same \nconviction, and the new petition asserts a claim that was, or c ould have been, raised in a prior \nhabeas petition.  See Benchoff , 404 F.3d at 817;  In re Olabode , 325 F.3d 166, 169- 73 (3d Cir. \n2003).  I f a habeas petitioner erroneously files a second or successive habeas petition \u201cin a \ndistrict court without the permiss ion of a court of appeals, the district court\u2019s only option is to \ndismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\u201d  Robinson \nv. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002).   \nIII.   DISCUSSION   \n The record in this ca se reveals that Petitioner\u2019s first federal habeas petition was settled  on \nthe merits, the instant Petition challenges the same 1985 conviction that w as challenged in his  \nfirst petition, and Petitioner\u2019s current argument that his \u201cnatural life\u201d sentence is unconstitutional \ncould have been asserted in his first petition.   See Benchoff , 404 F.3d at 817- 18.  As  a result , the \nCourt concludes that the instant Petition constitutes a second or successive habeas petition under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.   4 \n Petitioner does not allege, and the record does not indicate, that the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit authorized the filing of the instant Petition .  Further, it would not be  in the  \ninterest of justice to transfer this case to the Third Circuit, because nothing in the Petition comes \nclose to satisfying the substantive requirements for a second or successive petition under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2).  Accord ingly , the Court will dismiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction .  \nSee Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254; Robinson, 313 F.3d at 139.   \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n For the reasons  set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss th is unauthorized \nsecond or successive Petition for lack of jurisdiction.  The Court will also decline to issue a \ncertificate of  appealability because Petitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing o f the  \ndenial of a constitutional right.\u201d  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United \nStates v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997).   \nA separate Order will be entered.  \n  \n \nApril 20, 20 22                                   /s/ Richard G.
