(\u201cGroupon\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d), presently be fore the \nCourt is Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) (\u201cMotion\u201d).  (D.I. 117)  For the reasons that follow, the Court orders that the Motion is  \nGRANTED.     \nI. BACKGROUND  Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant on October 6, 2017, alleging that Defendant \ninfringed U nited States  Patent No. 6,061,660 (the \u201c'660 patent\u201d) , which claims a method and \nsystem for providing incentive progr ams over a computer network.  (D.I. 1  at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10)  More \nspecifically, the '660 patent  discloses an  incentive builder program with an award fulfillment \nsystem that permits multiple sponsors to customize and market incentive programs through a central market place using an interface.   (Id.)  In its original Complaint, Plain tiff asserted  13 \n\u201cexemplary \u201d claims  of the  '660 patent  against Defendant :  claims  1, 10, 16-21, 25, and 27-30.  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44 & ex. 3)\n1 \nIn October 2018, Defendant timely filed two inter partes review  petitions (the \u201cIPRs\u201d), \nchallenging 21 total c laims:  claims  1, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16-21, 25, 27-30, 67-69, 87, and 101 of the \n'660 patent  (the \u201cInvalidated Claims\u201d)  with the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s \n \n1  The original '660 patent  issued  on May  9, 2000, with  15 claims.   ('660 patent)  \nThe patent  thereafter  went  through an  ex parte  reexamination , and  a reexamination  certificate \nwas issued  on February  6, 2015.  In  the reexamination, claims  1, 2, 4, 7 and  14 were determined  \nto be patentable as  amended,  claims  3, 5, 6, 8-13 and 15 were not reexamined,  and new  claims  \n16-115 were added.  ( Id.)  The  '660 patent  is found on the docket in  this case,  (D.I.  1, ex. 1), and \nherein  the Court will simply  cite to the \u201c'660 patent.\u201d  The  non- reexamined  claims  are found at \nthe end  of the original '660 patent , while  the remaining relevant  claims  are found in  the Ex  Parte  \nReexamination  Certificate for the '660 patent .  (Tr.  at 10) \n3 \n (\u201cPTO\u201d) Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) .  (IPR2019-00044, Paper 1 at 1 (P.T.A.B. \nOct. 10, 2018); id., Paper 10 at 1 (P.T.A.B. Jan. 3, 2019); IPR2019-00061, Paper 1 at 1 (P.T.A.B. \nOct. 10, 2018))  This included all 13 of the \u201cexemplary\u201d claims identified by Plaintiff in its  \nComplaint , plus eight additional claims  of the patent.2  In IPR 2019- 00044, Defendant relied on \nU.S. Patent No. 5,816,918 (\u201cKelly\u201d) as its primary reference; according to De fendant , Kelly  \ndisclosed a \u201csystem deploying promotional games over a wide area network, like the internet[,]\u201d \nin which \u201cplayers us[e] game units to interact with a \u2018host\u2019 server that provides promotional games, including games that may be supplied by a plurality of sponsors.\u201d  (IPR2019-00044, Paper 10 at 4, 16-17)  In that same IPR, Defendant also relied on Microsoft \u00ae FrontPage \nUnleashed  (1st ed. 1996) (\u201cStanek\u201d),  U.S. Patent No. 5,890,175 (\u201cWong\u201d), and U.S. Patent No. \n5,905,895 (\u201cHalter\u201d) as secondary references.  ( Id. at 3-4)  In IPR2019-00061, Defendant relied \non U.S. Patent No. 5,710,887 (\u201cChelliah\u201d) as its primary reference; according to Defenda nt, \nChelliah  disclosed an \u201c electronic commerce system with an \u2018Incentives Subsystem\u2019 to create and \nhost incentive s programs on behalf of sponsors (i.e., stores) .\u201d  (IPR2019-00061, Paper 1 at 4, 20)  \nDefendant also relied on Halter and U.S. Patent No. 6,035,280 (\u201cChristensen\u201d) as secondary references.  ( Id. at 3-4)   \nOn February 6, 2019, a few months a fter Defendant  filed its IPR petitions, Plaintiff filed \nan Amended Complaint in this case .  (D.I. 76)  In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff now \nasserted not only the same 13 claims as it did in its original Complaint, but it also added an \n \n2  Defendant \u2019s counsel stated  that at the time  Defendant  filed  these IPR petitions,  \nthe 13 claims  referenced  in the original Complaint were the only claims  that Plaintiff  had \nindicated  it would assert  against  Defendant  in this case.  (Tr.  at 13-14)  Since the '660 patent  had \n115 claims  after  reexamination , and  since it is  \u201cnot  practical  to pursue that  many  claims  in the \n[PTO , Defendant] \u201d took the 13 \u201c exemplary \u201d claims  asserted  against  it in the original Complaint, \nadded  the eight above- referenced  \u201cadditional [claims,]\u201d and  then  filed  the IPR petitions  as to 21 \nclaims  in total.  ( Id.; see also id. at  108) 4 \n additional 22 newly -asserted claims:  claims 12, 75- 76, 87- 89, 91- 93, 95- 97, 100- 04, and 107- 11.  \n(D.I. 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 49, 63- 64)  Because they were first raised after Defendant\u2019s IPR filing deadline had \npassed, nearly all of these 22 newly -asserted claims were not include d in Defendant\u2019s IPR \npetitions.  \nIn April 2019, the PTAB instituted IPR as to both IPR petitions and on all 21 challenged \nclaims of the '660 patent .  (D.I. 93 at 1 )  And in May 2019, the parties jointly stipulated that the \ninstant case should be stayed, pending the issuance of Final Written Decisions by the PTAB  in \nboth IPR proceedings.  ( Id.) \nOn April 16, 2020, the PTAB  issued Final Written Decisions in both IPRs, determining \nthat all of the Invalidated Claims were invalid.  See  Groupon, Inc. v. Kroy IP Holdings, LLC , \nIPR2019- 00061, 2020 WL 1900402 (P.T.A.B. Apr . 16, 2020) (hereinafter \u201c Groupon I \u201d or \n\u201cIPR2019- 00061\u201d ); Groupon, Inc. v. Kroy IP Holdings, LLC , IPR2019- 00044, 2020 WL \n1900398 (P.T.A.B. Apr. 16, 2020) (hereinafter \u201c Groupon II \u201d or \u201cIPR2019- 00044\u201d ).  Pla intiff \nappealed , but it did not seek to lift the st ay of the instant case at th at time .  (D.I. 96)   And on June \n14, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit summarily affirmed the \nPTAB\u2019s decision s, pursuant to Federal Circuit Rule 36 (\u201cRule 36\u201d) .  Kroy IP Holdings, LLC v. \nGroupon, Inc., 849 F. App\u2019x 930 (Fed. Cir. 2021).   \nIn IPR2019- 00061, the PTAB and Federal Circuit invalidated all of the Invalidated \nClaims with the exception of claims 10 and 12, on the grounds that either Chelliah anticipated these claims or that Chelliah in combination with Christensen rendered the claims obvious.  Groupon I , 2020 WL 1900402, at *1, *25.  And in IPR2019- 00044, the PTAB and Federal \nCircuit invalidated all of the Invalidated Claims as obvious in light of Kelly and one or more of 5 \n the relev ant secondary references ( i.e., Stanek , Halter  and/or Wong).  Groupon II, 2020 WL \n1900398, at *1, *27.   \n  Following the Federal Circui t\u2019s affirmance, the instant case remained stayed .  Plaintiff  \ninformed this Court that it was determining whether to proce ed on the asserted claims that had \nnot been at issue in the IPR  (the \u201cAdditional Claims \u201d).  (D.I. 99)  After Plaintiff obtained new \noutside counsel in the case, (D.I. 101), the parties asked this Court for additional time to a ddress \nthe case\u2019s status, (D.I. 102).  In November  2021, Plaintiff informed Defendant that it intended to \npursue the Additional Claims ; both sides agreed that discovery should remain stayed, pending a \ndecision on whether Plaintiff was collaterally estopped  from litigating the Additional Claims \nhere.  (D.I. 104 at 2- 3)   \nIn December 2021, Plaintiff  next  sought leave to file a Second Amended Complaint  (the \n\u201cOperative Complaint\u201d) .  (D.I. 107)   United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika, to whom \nthis case is  otherwise ass igned, granted -in-part and denied -in-part the motion to amend on March \n2, 2022.  The Operative Complaint , which was filed on March 10, 2022, now limited the present \naction to only 14 asserted claims:  c laims 91 -93, 95- 97, 100, 103- 04, and 107- 11 (the \u201cNewl y \nAsserted  Claims\u201d) .  (D.I. 111 at \u00b6\u00b6 48- 80)  Plaintiff assert ed both direct  infringement  (Count I) \nand indirect infringement  (Count II) of the Newly Asserted Claims .  (Id.)   \nDefendant  then  filed the instant Motion, seeking dismissal of the Operative Complaint, \non April 7, 2022.  (D.I. 117)  On April 12, 2022, t he parties consented to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nto conduct all proceedings on and enter a final order on the Motion.  (D.I. 119)   Briefing on the \nMotion was completed on April 28, 2022, (D.I. 121) , and the Court heard oral argument on the \nMotion on October 12, 2022.  6 \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint based \nupon the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The \nsufficiency of pleadings for non-fraud cases is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   \nIn order to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \u201ca complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).   In assessing such a motion, the court first separates the factual and legal elements of a \nclaim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts as true, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009).  Second, the \ncourt determines \u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a \u2018plausible claim for relief .\u2019\u201d  Id. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft , 556 U.S. at 679). \nA Rule 12(b)(6) movant may also challenge a pleading by invoking an affirmative \ndefense, as Defendant does here.  (Tr. at 16)\n3  The Court may dismiss a claim pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) in light of an affirmative defense, but only where the well- pleaded factual allegations in \nthe complaint (along with the other materials that the Court may properly consider), construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, clearly suffice to establish the defense.  Se e Jones v. \n \n3  Collateral  estoppel is  an affirmative  defense.   United  Therapeutics Corp. v.  \nLiquidia Techs.,  Inc., Civil Action  No. 20-755- RGA,  2022 WL  1503923, at  *1 (D.  Del.  May  12, \n2022).  This  defense can  be adjudicated  at the motion  to dismiss  stage.   M & M Stone Co. v.  \nPennsylvania, 388 F.  App\u2019x  156, 162 (3d  Cir. 2010). \n 7 \n Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 215 (2007); Wilson Wolf Mfg. Corp. v. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc ., Civil \nAction No. 19-2316, 2020 WL 7771039, at *2 n.1 (D. Del. Dec. 30, 2020).4   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDefendant \u2019s primary basis for dismissal of the Operative Complaint is its assertion that \nPlaintiff is collaterally estopped from alleging infringement of the Newly Asserted Claims.  (D.I. \n118 at 6-21)5  In addressing this issue, t he Court will first discuss the law relating to collateral \nestoppel in th e patent context .  Thereafter, it will address the parties\u2019 arguments on the merits, \nexplaining why Defendant\u2019s Motion in this regar d is well taken .   \nA. Collateral Estoppel \nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel, also referred to as \u201cissue preclusion,\u201d serves to \n\u201c\u2018preclude parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to \nlitigate, \u2019 which \u2018protects their adversaries from the expense and vexation a ttending multiple \nlawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\u2019\u201d  Voter Verified, Inc. v. Election Sys. & Software LLC , 887 \n \n4 Defendant  requested  that the Court take judicial notice of the PTAB\u2019s  Final  \nWritten  Decisions  and the Federal  Circuit\u2019s  order  affirming  those decisions, (D.I.  118 at  4), and \nPlaintiff  did not object.   Herein,  the Court will do so.  See Princeton  Digital Image Corp. v.  \nKonami Digital Ent . Inc., Civil Action  No. 12-1461- LPS-CJB,  2017 WL  239326, at  *3 n.7 (D.  \nDel. Jan. 19, 2017). \n \n5  Defendant  also sought dismissal  of the Operative Complaint,  in whole or in  part,  \non two  other bases:   (1) that  the New ly Asserted  Claims  lack  an inventive concept  and are patent  \nineligible  under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (\u201cSection  101\u201d), (D.I.  118 at  22); and (2) that Count II  of the  \ncomplaint,  via which  Plaintiff  asserts  indirect  infringement, fa ils to allege a direct  infringer an d \nshould therefore be dismissed.   (Id. at 23-24)  Below,  the Court will explain  why  it concludes \nthat dismissal  of the Operative Complaint is  warranted  due to  Defendant\u2019s  affirmative  defense of \ncollateral  estoppel.  In light of this , the Court need  not and  will not address  the other two  issues \nraised  by Defendant.  (That  said,  the Court notes for the record  that in its answering brief,  \nPlaintiff  had agreed  to dismiss  Count II with prejudice.).   (D.I.  120 at  8)   \n 8 \n F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  (quoting Mont. v. United States , 440 U.S. 147, 153- 54 (1979)).  \nWhen assessing the doctrine in a patent case, a district court must apply regional circuit law to \nthe general procedural question of whether collateral estoppel applies , while applying Federal \nCircui t law to questions \u201c involving substantive issues of patent law , issues of [collateral \nestoppel] that implicate substantive patent law issues, or issues of [collateral estoppel]  that \nimplicate the scope of [the Federal Circuit\u2019s] own previous decisions.\u201d   See  Soverain Software \nLLC v. Victoria \u2019s Secret Direct Brand Mgmt., LLC , 778 F.3d 1311, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  The \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has identified four standard requirements  \nthat must be met in order for the doctrine of collateral estoppel to apply :  \u201c(1) the identical issue \nwas previously adjudicated; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the previous determination was necessary to the decision; and (4) the party being precluded from relitigating the issue was fully represented in the prior action.\u201d   Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. L \u2019Oreal USA, Inc., 458 \nF.3d 244, 249 (3d Cir. 2006)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .   \nThe Federal Circuit has held that when the PTAB  issues a f inal judgment  on the \ninvalidity of a patent  claim, this will have  an issue -preclusive effect on any pending or co -\npending district court actions involving that same patent  claim  (even though the district court and \nPTAB , inter alia , require a patent challenger to meet different bur dens of proof  in order to \nestablish invalidity ).  See XY, LLC v. Trans Ova Genetics , 890 F.3d 1282, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2018); \ncf. MaxLinear, Inc. v. CF CRESPE LLC , 880 F.3d 1373, 1376- 77 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (applying \ncollateral estoppel based on a PTAB  decision, and  stating that \u201c[i]t is well established that \ncollateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, applies\u201d  when the same issue is before a \ncourt and an adm inistrative agency ) (citing B & B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc., 135 S. \nCt. 1293, 1303 (2015)).  The Federal Circuit has  further  held that  \u201c[c]omplete identity of claims 9 \n is not required to satisfy the identity -of-issues requirement for claim preclu sion.\u201d  Soverain, 778 \nF.3d at 1319; see also  Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South, LLC , 735 F.3d 1333, 1342 (Fed. \nCir. 2013) (\u201cOur p recedent does not limit collateral estoppel to patent claims that are identical.\u201d) .  \nRather, the inquiry in  that instance hinges on the \u201cidentity of the issues that were litigated.\u201d  \nOhio Willow Wood Co., 735 F.3d at  1342 (emphasis in original).  In other words, if \u201c the \ndifferences between the unadjudicated patent claims and adjudicated patent claims do not \nmaterially alter the question of invalidity , collateral estoppel applies.\u201d  Id.  (emphasis added) . \nTherefor e, when one considers these two lines of authority together,  it follows that:  (1) if \nthe PTAB issues a final judgment invalidating a patent claim; and (2) if another claim in the same patent is at issue in a district court litigation ; and (3) if any  differences between the two \nclaims do not materially alter the  question of invalidity regarding the district court claim; then \n(4) the patentee will be collaterally estopped from litigating the district court claim (assuming the other requirements of the collateral estoppel doctrine are met).  See  M2M Solutions LLC, et al. v. \nSierra Wireless Am ., Inc. et al. , Civil Action No. 14 -1102-RGA, D.I. 213 at 5-7 (D. Del. Mar. \n31, 2021) (granting summary judgment on collateral estoppel grounds regarding patent claims that were not materially different from claims in the same patent that had been previously invalidated by the PTAB); Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Lenovo Grp. Ltd., 370 F. Supp. 3d 251, 257 ( D. Mass. 2019) (\u201cPTAB decisions have a collateral -estoppel effect in distr ict court on \nunadjudicated claims that do not \u2018materially alter the q uestion of invalidity.\u2019\u201d)  (citation omitted); \nsee also  (Tr. at 24 -26).\n6   \n \n6  This articulation  of the law  is not disputed by either  side here.  Plaintiff  \nacknowledged  at oral argument  that collateral  estoppel  can,  under certain  circumstances,  apply to  \nbar litigation  of patent  claims  that were not invalidated  in an IPR proceeding, but which  are not \nmaterially  differen t from  the claims  that were invalidated  in such  a proceeding.  ( Tr. at 77, 82)  \nIndeed,  a number of district courts have granted  motions to  dismiss on the basis  of collateral  10 \n B. Discussion  \nThe parties\u2019 primary dispute regarding the Motion relates to the first collateral estoppel \nrequire ment:  whether \u201c the identical issue was previously adjudicated.\u201d7  As noted above, \n \nestoppel, wherein  the claims  at issue  were not identical  to, but not materially  different  from,  \npreviously- invalidated/ineligible  claims .  See,  e.g., NetSoc LLC  v. Oath, Inc. , No.  18-CV-12267 \n(RA), 2020 WL  419469, at *5-8 (S.D.N.Y.  Jan. 24, 2020); Arunachalam v.  Exxon  Mobil Corp., \nCIVIL  NO.  6:19- CV-00171- ADA, 2019 WL  10303695, at  *2-4 (W.D.  Tex. June 26, 2019).  \nHere,  the key  dispute between  the parties  is over whether,  in fact,  each  of the Newly  Asserted  \nclaims  is materially  different  from  an invalidity  perspective than  certain  Invalidated  Claims .   \n \n7  In its answering  brief,  Plaintiff also  raised  an issue  relating  to the third  collateral  \nestoppel requirement:   whether  the previous determination  was necessary  to the decision .  Here,  \nPlaintiff  argued  that because the Federal  Circuit summarily  affirmed  the PTAB\u2019s  Final  Written  \nDecision s pursuant to  Rule 36, this  precludes  application  of the collateral  estoppel doctrine.  \n(D.I.  120 at  4-5)  More  specifically,  Plaintiff  asserts that  collateral  estoppel cannot apply because \nthe \u201cRule 36 affirmance  here was  silent as  to which  aspects  of the  multiple  independent grounds \nrelied  on by the PTAB  [to invalidate  the Invalidated  Claims]  were those the  Federal  Circuit \napproved of or  not.\u201d  ( Id. at 4)   \n \nIn r esponse, however, Defendant explained  why  the fact of the Rule 36 affirmance does \nnot impede i ts collateral  estoppel argument.  Defendant argued, and the Court  agrees,  that the \nfact of the Rule 36 affirmance is  immaterial here  because Plaintiff  cannot show how the \naffirmance could have been  premised  on a ground that would not  collaterally  estop  the assertion  \nof any  Newly  Asserted  Claim.   (D.I.  121 at  4-6; see  also D.I.  118; Tr.  at 59-64); cf.  Phil -Insul \nCorp. v.  Airlite  Plastics  Co., 854 F.3d 1344, 1356-57 (Fed.

(Tr.  at 98-102)  \nPlaintiff\u2019s  counsel acknowledged  that he could not do so, and  stated  that he was  \u201cnot aware\u201d of \nthis having occurred here .  (Id. at 101)  In light of this, the Court rejects  Plaintiff\u2019s  argument that  \nDefendant  has failed  to establish  the applicability  of the third  collateral  estoppel requirement.   \n(Id. at 29 (Defendant\u2019s  counsel noting that  \u201cevery  conceivable ground upon which  the Federal  14 \n  \nother differences  between  a particular  Invalidated  Claim and  Newly  Asserted  Claim that  Plaintiff  \ndid not identify  as material  in its briefing, the Court will assume  those differences  are not \nrelevant  to the collateral  estoppel issues discussed  herein .  Plaintiff  has waived  any argument to  \nthe contrary.

(D.I.  \n120; Tr.  at 79)  So  Plaintiff  had more  than  enough briefing  space to  make detailed  arguments \nabout the collateral  estoppel issues at  play  here.  ( D.I. 121 at  11; Tr.  at 80)  The Court will only \naddress  here in the arguments Plaintiff  did make.  \n \nPlaintiff \u2019s counsel also  suggested during oral  argument that  a reason  why Plaintiff  did not \nsay more  in its briefing  about questions of materiality  was because Plaintiff  did not want  to risk \nbeing \u201cboxed in\u201d to  those positions \u201cwithout the proper claim  construction [having yet  \noccurred]\u201d or  being \u201ctrapped  into making arguments now that  could impact  our infringement \ncase\u201d in  the future.   (Tr. at 73, 81-83)  But this  cannot be a viable defense to  Defendant\u2019s  \nMotion.  Patentees,  for example,  face similar  circumstance s when  responding to  motions to  \ndismiss  premised  on Section  101 grounds; there,  as here,  a movant is  arguing that  the presence of \nan affirmative  defense, evident in  the complaint and  exhibits attached  thereto,  warrants  dismissal  \nof the plaintiff\u2019s  pleading.  In  the Section  101 context, it is  not enough for a patentee to  simply  \npoint to  the fact  that the case is  at an early  stage and suggest that,  as a result,  it need  not \npersuasively  address  the merits  of the defendant\u2019s motion.  Instead,  if there  are reasons  why  the \nmotion  should be denied , the patentee is  expected  to actually  express  those reasons  to the Court; \nfailure  to do so  could lead  to a grant of the motion .

To start, as Plaintiff has acknowledged , \nthe fact that the claim language of the relevant element of the Invalidated Claim and the Newly \nAsserted Claim is different is not dispositive as to whether collateral estoppel applies  here.   (Tr. \nat 82)  Instead, t he issue is whether the differences between the respective claims materially alter \nthe question of invalidity ; if they do not, then collateral estoppel can appl y.  See, e.g., Ohio \nWillow Wood, 735 F.3d at 1342.  Beyond pointing out the superfi cial differences  in language  \nbetween the respective claims , Plaintiff made no further argument as to why  those differences \nactually are material to  the invalidity inquiry.

Furthermore, as Defendant persuasively points out, Newly Asserted \nClaims 95 and 111 are, in fact, broader  than the ir comparable Invali dated  Claims.   (D.I. 121 at 6-\n7)  Claim 111 does not require, as Invalidated Claim 14 did, that the request  to validate the award  \nat issue must come from one of the sponsors associated with the incentive program.  And c laim \n95 does not require , as Invalidated Claim 87 did , that  the host computer referenced therein must \nbe one \u201chaving a server .\u201d  In these circumstances, where the claim found invalid by the PTAB \nand the Federal Circuit  is narrower in scope than the Newly Asserted Claim , that must mean  that \nthe broader Newly Asserted C laim is similarly invalid .9  (D.I. 121 at 6- 7)   \nPlaintiff makes one other argument about the purported materiality of a difference \nbetween Newly Asserted Claim 95 and Invalidated Claim 87 ; it notes that claim 95 is a method \nclaim, while c laim 87 is  directed to a system.  (D.I. 120 at 6 n.4)  But Plaintiff put forward no \nfurther argument as to how or why this difference should matter in the invalidity/collateral estoppel analysis.  And absent any further elucidation on this point from Plaintiff, the Court \n \n9  Cf. AstraZeneca  LP v. Breath  Ltd., 542 F.  App\u2019x 971, 982 n.2 (Fed.

After all, the Federal Circuit has he ld in the analogous Section \n101/eligibility  context that system and method claims that \u201ccontain only minor differences in \nterminology [ but] require performance of the same basic process  . . . should rise or fall together.\u201d  \nAccenture Glob.

Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.) , 687 F.3d 1266, 1276- 77 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n(explaining that  if the claims at issue in an eligibility analysis are otherwise comparable, the fact \nthat some are system/machine/medium claims and other s are method/process claims need not \nmake a difference in the patentability analysis ).  As is indicated above, Newly Asserted Claim 95 \nis a method claim that is :  (1) worded nearly identically to Invalidated C laim 87 and (2) makes \nuse of all material eleme nts of claim 87\u2019s system in the claimed method.  Thus, the Court \ndiscerns no material difference regarding invalidity between the two claims.  \nFor these reasons, it is clear that any differences between Newly Asserted C laims 111 \nand 95 and Invalidated C laims 14 and 87, respectively, are insufficient to preclude the \napplication of collateral estoppel.  \n  2. Newly Asserted Claim 100  \nNewly Asserted Claim 100 recites a method of incentive program generation and \nredemption utilizing websites  through which a  sponsor and a consumer interact with the host, \nwherein the sponsor builds  the incentive program , and the consumer interacts  with the interface \nto participate.  Much (though not all) of the content of claim 100\u2019s method is found in the similarly -worded system claim of Invalidated Claim 16.  The PTAB found c laim 16 , which \ndepends from claim 1,  invalid as:  (1) anticipated by Chelliah, Groupon I , 2020 WL 1900402, at \n*12; (2) obvious over Chelliah and Christensen, id.  at *22;  and (3) obvious over Kelly and 20 \n skill in the art] would have known to implement the Dashboard interface as such.\u201d  Groupon I , \n2020 WL 1900402, at *12- 13 (alteration in original) ; see also id . at *21- 22.  The PTAB also \nfound that c laim 17 was obvious over Kelly in view of  Stanek  because \u201cStanek teaches that the \nhost\u2019s web server can be configured to provide a sponsor with functionality necessary to build a \npromotional web game employing the FrontPage Editor .\u201d  Groupon II , 2020 WL 1900398, at \n*11 (internal quotation marks  and citation omitted) .   \nAs for c laim 29, which encompasse s the system of c laim 16  and adds that t he interface of \na website of the host receives consumer interaction  to participate in the incentive program, the \nPTAB also found the claim  invalid for several reasons.  T he PTAB first  concluded  that c laim 29 \nwas anticipated by Chelliah , and obvious over Chelliah and Christensen, because Chelliah  \ndiscloses \u201ca consumer participating in the incentive programs via the website of the host \u2018using a WWW browser  application across a TCP/IP connection [.]\u2019\u201d  Groupon I , 2020 WL 1900402, at \n*13-14; see also id . at *19- 22.  The PTAB also found c laim 29 as obvious over Kelly and Stanek \nwhere Kelly disclosed that a \u201cplayer . . . may interact  via a website of the host to participate in \nthe promotional game[.]\u201d  Groupon II , 2020 WL 1900398, at *12.   \nDefendant therefore argues that in invalidating c laims 17 and 29, \u201cthe PTAB necessarily \nfound that Chelliah, as well as a system combining Kelly and Stanek, disclosed host systems having websites with which sponsors interacted to build incentive programs, and consumers interacted to p articipate.\u201d  (D.I. 118 at 11)  And t hus, it asserts that Newly Asserted C laim 100 , \nwhich contains requirements similar to claims 17 and 29, is not materially different from an invalidity perspective .  (Id.)   \nIn its briefing, Plaintiff responded only by noting Defendant\u2019s argument ( i.e., \u201cthat the \nPTAB found that \u2018website\u2019 elements of asserted claim 100 were found in the prior art\u201d) and by 21 \n accusing Defendant of wrongly \u201c attempting a \u2018mix -n\u2019-match\u2019 style of patent validity analysis\u201d  \n(hereafter, Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmix -and-match\u201d argument).   (D.I. 120 at 6)11    \nThe Court sides with Defendant.  The PTAB found that Chelliah and Kelly/ Stanek  \ndisclosed the website element s of c laims 17 and 29, and it found that the remaining system \nelements descr ibing those two claims were disclosed in :  (1) Chelliah ; (2) Chelliah in \ncombination with Christensen ; and (3) Kelly  in combination with Stanek.   And r elatedly, claim \n100\u2019s elements  (as is shown in the charts above), appear to include all of the important content of \nclaims 17 and 29, including the website elements.  Now t o be sure, claim 100  has two website \nelements , and both of those elements are not found in the same Invalidated Claim; instead, one \nelement apiece is found in Invalidated Claim 17 and 29, respectively.  But th at fact should not \nmake a difference to the collateral estoppel analysis .  If Chelliah  or Chelliah /Christensen  or \nKelly /Stanek all invalidate claim 17 and claim 29, then this must mean that the  same \n \n11  In explaining what  it meant  by this  \u201cmix -and-match\u201d  argument, Plaintiff  simply  \ncited  to the Federal  Circuit\u2019s  opinion in  KSR Int \u2019l Co. v.  Teleflex Inc ., 550 U.S. 398 (2007), and  \nparticularly  to KSR \u2019s statement  that a claim  \u201ccomposed of several  elements  is not proved obvious \nmerely  by demonst rating  that each  of its  elements  was,  independently, known in  the prior art.\u201d  \n550 U.S.  at 418.  KSR  does say  this,  of course.   In KSR, the Federal  Circuit explained  that in \norder to  find a claim  invalid  as obvious, an accused  infringer must not only demonstrate  that \neach of the  claim  elements  was found in  the prior art references  at issue,  but must also , inter  alia, \n\u201cidentify  a reason  that would have prompted a person  of ordinary skill in  the relevant  field  to \ncombine the elements  in the way  the claimed  new invention does.\u201d  Id .   \n \nHowever,  the Court does not understand wh y this  portion of KSR  is in conflict  with  the \nanalysis  it is undertaking here.   In finding that  certain  of the Invalidated  Claims  were invalid  as \nobvious, the PTAB  necessarily  found both that  the invalidating  references  at issue  disclosed  all \nof the Invalidated  Claims\u2019  elements,  and that  a POSITA  would have been  motivated  to combine \nthose elements  in the way  that the claimed  invention does.  (D.I.  121 at 8)  In this opinion, the \nCourt is  simply  assessing , from  there,  whether  any limitations  found in  the Newly  Asserted  \nClaims  that differ from  those in  the Invalidated  Claims  are material  to an invalidity  analysis .  \nThis is not a wrongful \u201cmix -and-match  style  of patent  validity  analysis .\u201d  It is  the very  type of \ncollateral  estoppel analysis  that the Federal  Circuit has  instructed  federal  district courts to  \nconduct.  ( Id.)   22 \n reference / reference combinations disclose all of the content found in claim 100 too.  And while \nthere are otherwise a few words in claim 100 that differ from the words used in claims 17 and 29 \n(and claim 16, from which they depend), Plaintiff did not offer any argument as to why such \nwording differences are material to the Court\u2019s analysis here.  See  Ohio  Willow  Wood, 735 F.3d \nat 1343 (\u201c Thus, the mere use of different words in these portions of the claims does not create a \nnew issue of invalidity.\u201d).  Nor can the Court discern any reason why they would be.   \nTherefore, the Court con cludes that  Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from asser ting c laim \n100.  See In  re Arunachalam , 709 F.  App \u2019x 699, 703 (Fed.  Cir. 2017) (applying collateral \nestoppel where \u201ca ny differences between the two sets of claims [, one set in one patent having \nbeen deemed unpatentable by the PTAB, the other set in a related patent having been asserted in \nthe instant district court litigation, were]  not material such that those differences would affect the \npatentability of the chal lenged claims\u201d) . \n3. Newly Asserted Claims 103, 104 and 107-110 \n N\next, the Court addresses six additional claims:  Newly Asserted Claims 103, 104 and \n107-110.  The Court will begin with claims 103 and 107 and  in doing so, it w ill focus solely  on \nclaim 107.12 \nDefendant argued that claim 107 recites the use of a nearly identical asserted invention to \nthat found in Invalidated Claim 1 , a system claim .  (D.I. 118 at 14)  The PTAB concluded that \n \n12  In its briefing, Defendant  asserted  that claim  107 is  \u201crepresentative\u201d of claim  103 \nbecause the  two claims  are \u201cessent ially identical[ .]\u201d  (D.I.  118 at  14)  P laintiff  did not dispute \nthis.  (D.I.  120)  And  claim 103 and  claim  107 are indeed  very  similar; the former  is a \u201cmethod  \nof incentive program generation\u201d and  the latter  is a \u201cmethod  of incentive program generation an d \nredemption[.]\u201d  ('660 patent , Reexamination  Certificate,  cols.  8:56-9:16, 9:24-10:3)  Claim 107 \nappears  to contain  nearly  all of claim  103\u2019s meaningful limitations,  and it also  adds a few  \nadditional narrowing limitations  (e.g., its  \u201cissuing an  award\u201d and  \u201creceiving,  from  the sponsor\u201d \nelements)  relating  to an award  issued  to a consumer.  The  Court thus sees  no reason  not to  treat  \nclaim  107 as  representative of claim  103 for these purposes.  It will do so  here.    25 \n number of  tickets or prize credits which the player has won.  The \nplayer can then take the card and insert  the card into a suitable card \nreader connected to a prize selection apparatus [.] . . .  \n \nKelly discloses that such smart cards may include a personal identification number or information associated with the consumer\u2019s participation in the incentive program . \n \n(IPR2019- 00044, Paper 10 at 50- 51 (citations omitted)  (cited in  Groupon II , 2020 WL 1900398, \nat *19) )  \n In light of all of this, Defendant argues that the electronic card limitation in Newly \nAsserted Claim 107 is not materially different from the electronic card limitation in Invalidated \nClaim 12 .  It therefore  asserts  that the PTAB necessarily found that Kelly and Stanek disclosed \nall of the elements of claim 107  (as part of its validity analysis of claims 1 and 12), including the \nelectronic card limitation, such that Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from asserting claim 107 \n(and, relatedly,  claim 103) .  (D.I. 118 at 17)     \nIn response, Plaintiff  again said very little in its briefing.  It merely noted that the \n\u201celectronic card\u201d element was absent from  Invalidated Claim 1 , and it again suggested that \nDefendant was somehow wrongly at tempting a \u201cmix -and-match\u201d invalidity argument .  (D.I. 120 \nat 6) \nAt oral argument , Plaintiff\u2019s counsel added a bit more.  Counsel stated that its \u201cstrongest\u201d \narguments against estoppel relate to the claims with the electronic card limitation in them.  (Tr.  at \n86)  Counsel then pointed to claim 107\u2019s requirement that the method not only \u201c issu[es] an \nelectronic card to the consumer, the electronic card storing information of the consumer\u201d but that this information  is to be used \u201c for accessing the promotion of the sponsor offered to the \nconsumer.\u201d  ( '660 patent , Reexamination Certificate, col. 10:1- 3; see also  Tr. at 86 ( \u201cHere the \nclaim language includes the accessing feature, and that was not disclosed in the prior art.  So 26 \n right there is a differe nce.\u201d) )  That said, aside from noting that this  \u201cfor accessing the promotion\u201d \nlanguage was \u201cdifferent\u201d from the language in claim 12 , and making the bald statement that th is \nlimitation \u201cwas not disclosed in the prior art[,]\u201d counsel did not say any more ab out why  this \nadditional claim language was material to patentability.  ( Tr. at 86)  The Court then followed up.  \nIt asked why  it was \u201cplausible . . . from an invalidity perspective [that] there could be a material \ndifference between what was disclosed in t his prior art [i.e., Kelly] . . . versus what the electronic \ncard limitation [discloses] in [c]laim 107[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 86-87)  On that front, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel \nacknowledged that Plaintiff \u201cdid [ not] make [that type of] argument\u201d in its briefing (i.e., about \nwhy claim 107\u2019s \u201cfor accessing the promotion\u201d language was material to patentability); instead, \ncounsel acknowledged that its briefing  had relied on \u201cconclusory\u201d statements regarding \nmateriality.  ( Id. at 87-89)  Counsel noted that Plaintiff had not yet assessed the prior art in order \nto be able to better answer th e Court\u2019s  question, and so he was not \u201cprepared to\u201d make such an \nargument at this stage of the case.  ( Id. at 87-91)13 \nThe Court concludes  that Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from asserting Newly Asserted \nClaim 107  (and thus, also Newly Asserted Claim 103).  The electronic card limitation in claim \n107 first requires that an electronic card be issued and that it b e for \u201cstoring informat ion of the \nconsumer [.]\u201d  ( '660 patent , Reexamination Certificate, col. 10:2)  There can be no question that \nthis concept is found in claim 12 and was disclosed in Kelly , (Tr. at 50) ; indeed, Plaintiff does \nnot argue otherwise.  As for the electronic card limitation\u2019s additional requirement that the card \n \n13  Twice during this  portion of or al argument, Plaintiff\u2019s  counsel suggested that  \nclaim  construction might illuminate  why  the \u201cfor  accessing  the promotion\u201d  language in  claim  \n107 makes  a material difference regarding patentability.   (Tr.  at 88, 90)  The  Court then  asked  \nwhy this was so\u2014i.e., what  construction would Plaintiff  give to  that term,  and how would such  a \nconstruction help  to demonstrate that  this aspect  of claim  107 was  not disclosed  by Kelly?   (Id. at \n92)  To  that,  Plaintiff\u2019s  counsel responded that  he could not answer  that quest ion now, but would \nbe prepared  to do so  at the summary  judgment stage of the case.   (Id.) 27 \n be \u201cfor accessing the promotion of the sponsor  offered to the consumer[,]\u201d  ('660 patent , \nReexamination Certificate, col . 10:2- 3), the record clearly indicates that this aspect of the \ninvention was also implicated by claim 12 and disclosed  in Kelly.  More specifically:  \n\u2022 Claim 12 had a limitation  requiring that the electronic card \ndescribed t herein was one \u201cfor fulfillment of an award \u201d and \nthat the information retained by the card was \u201cassociated with \nthe consumer\u2019s participation in an incentive program[ .]\u201d  ('660 \npatent , col. 49:13- 17)  In other words, the claim facially \nrequired that the electronic card must be  capable of being  used \nby the consumer to participate in the incentive program and to obtain (or \u201cfulfil[l]\u201d) a n award offered by the program\u2019s \nsponsor .  (Tr. at 50 (Defendant\u2019s counsel noting that the \nelectronic card in claim 12 contains \u201cinformation for accessing the promotion of a sponsor because it . . . is an electronic card that is intended to fulfill an award [and it] has information necessary for the customer\u2019s or consumer\u2019s participation in the in[c]entive program\u201d) ; id. at 51 )  In order to be able to use an \nelectronic card to fulfill an award offered by a sponsor ( i.e., \nwhat is described in claim 12), the card would necessarily have to be able to be used for \u201caccessing the promotion of the \nsponsor\u201d  (i.e., what is described in claim 107).   \n \n\u2022 In determining that Kelly disclosed the electronic card \nlimitation in claim 12, the PTAB cited to Defendant\u2019s description of Kell y.  That description noted how Kelly \ndisclosed that:  (1) the consumer information on the electronic card described therein i s \u201cassociated with the consumer\u2019s \nparticipation in the incentive program\u201d ; and (2) the electronic \ncard can be inserted \u201cinto a suitable card reader connected  to a \nprize selection apparatus [.]\u201d  This demonstrates that Kelly \ndisclosed use of an electronic card \u201cfor accessing the \npromotion of the sponsor offered to the consumer.\u201d   (Id. at 51-\n52)   \n Therefore, in light of the PTAB\u2019s finding that claims 1 and 12 were invalid as obvious in light of \nKelly and Stanek, Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from asserting cl aims 103 and 107, since no \nadditional elements in those claims would materially alter the question of invalidity .     \n This then leads to the  analysis of Newly Asserted Claims 104 and 108- 10, all of which \ndepend from Claims 103 and 107.  Claims 104 and 108- 10 each contain further limitations 28 \n relating to the electronic card element of claims 103 and 107 \u2014in that they require  \u201cvalidating \nparticipation of the consumer in the promotion using the electronic card\u201d or \u201cvalidating the \naward using the database  and the electronic card\u201d or \u201cwherein the electronic card indicates \nparticipation of the consumer in the promotion.\u201d  ( '660 patent , Reexamination Certificate, cols. \n9:17- 19, 10:4- 11)  Defendant argues that these four additional claims each  simply \u201crecite [ \nfurther] use of the electronic card in connection with the consumer\u2019s participation in the incentive program or the validation of the award\u201d  and that Kelly \u201cdisclosed use of an electronic \ncard for  each of  these purposes.\u201d  (D.I. 118 at 17)  The Court cannot see why Defendant\u2019s \nposition is incorrect.  ( See IPR2019- 00044, Paper 10 at 50- 51 (Defendant noting to the PTAB  \nthat Kelly discloses use of the electronic card for insertion into a card reader that is connected to the prize selection apparatus))  And  crucially , Plaintiff provided no specific argument to the \ncontrary , either i n its briefing  or at oral argument , and thus has waived any such argument here .  \nSee supra n.8.  Thus, the Court finds that collateral estoppel precludes Plaintiff\u2019s assertion of \nthese additional claims, as well.  \n4. Newly Asserted Claim 91  \n Defendant next argued that Newly Asserted Claim 91 \u201cduplicates limitations found in \nInvalidated Claims 7 and 87[,]\u201d and, therefore, \u201c[t]he PTAB necessarily determined the method recited in Claim 91 was anticipated by, and obvious in light of, the prior art.\u201d  (D.I. 118 at 18)  The PTAB found that C laims 7 and 87 wer e invalid as:  (1) anticipated by Chelliah, Groupon I , \n2020 WL 1900402, at *14- 15, *17- 18; (2) obvious over Chelliah and Christensen, id. at *22; (3) \nobvious over Kelly and Stanek, Groupon II , 2020 WL 1900398, at *13, *15; and (4) obvious \nover Kelly and Wong, id. at *21.  The relevant portions of c laim 7 , along with the entirety of \nclaim 87 and claim 91, are reproduced below:  31 \n than that in claims 7 and 87,14 Plaintiff has not articulated  (and the Court cannot see ) how those \nslight differences would make a difference in a validity analysis.  See Ohio Willow Wood, 735 \nF.3d at 1342.  The Court therefore concludes that Defendant has established that the assertion of \nClaim 91 is precluded by collateral estoppel.   \n5. Newly Asserted Claims 92 -93 & 9 6-97 \nLastly, the Court assesses Newly Asserted Claims 92 -93 and 96-97.  It begins with the \nlatter two claims.    \nClaims 96 and 97 depend from Newly Asserted Claim 95; as discussed above,  Plaintiff is \ncollaterally estopped from litigating claim 95 here  in light of the PTAB\u2019s decision regarding \nInvalidated Claim 87.  Claim 95 required, inter alia , that the claimed met hod comprises \n\u201creceiving a co nsumer request to search for promotions from among a plurality of promotions \noffered to the consumer by a plurality of sponsors.\u201d  ('660 patent , Reexamination Certificate, col. \n7:32-34)  Claim 96 simply adds that the consumer request must involve searching for the promotions \u201cusing a name  of the sponsor [,]\u201d while c laim 97 adds only that the request has to \ninvolve searching by \u201c type of promotion[.]\u201d  ( Id., col. 7:37-39, 7:43-45 (emphasis ad ded)) \n \n14  By way of example, Invalidated C laim 7 includes a limitation requiring that the \nmethod comprises \u201cassociating an object in the database with each parameter entered  by the \nplurality of sponsors [,]\u201d while Newly Asserted Claim 91 includes a limitation requiring that the \nmethod comprises \u201cassociating an object with each parameter entered by the user [.]\u201d  ( '660 \npatent , Reexamination Certificate, cols. 2: 16-17, 6:38-39 (emphasis added))  Does this difference \nin wording (regarding who enters the parameters at issue) materially alter the question of \ninvalidity ?  Again, Plaintiff never  specifically  argued that it did.  At  oral argument, the Court \nquestioned Defendant\u2019s counsel about this issue, and counsel persuasively explained that in claim 91, the term \u201cuser\u201d c an include reference to the \u201csponsor .\u201d  (Tr. at 55)  This is because the \nclaim explains that it is the \u201csponsor \u201d who offers the incentive program, and that th e \u201cuser\u201d is the \none who is associating objects with certain parameters that are used to build that very same incentive program.  ( Id.)  So it does in fact appear that the \u201cuser\u201d in claim 91 can be a \u201csponsor\u201d \n(as described in claim 7 ).  Thus, these two claim limitations do not appear to be materially \ndifferent in scope from an invalidity perspective.   32 \n With regard to claim 96\u2019s add of searching by sponsor name, Defendant argued that the \nPTAB fo und c laim 87 invalid \u201cbased upon prior art disclosing the search for incentive programs \nusing the identity of the sponsor  (i.e., the supplier\u2019s \u2018storefront\u2019 or \u2018brand name\u2019). \u201d  (D.I. 118 at \n12-13 (emphasis in original))  More specifically, in IPR2019- 00061, t he PTAB found c laim 87 \nanticipated by Chelliah ; in doing so, it noted that:  (1) claim 87 required that, inter alia , a \nconsumer make a request to \u201csearch for promotions from among a plurality of promotions \noffered to the consumer by a plurality of sponsors\u201d; and (2) this limitation was  found in Chelliah , \nwhich involved a consumer request that \u201cprompts a search of the database for incentive programs of th[e] supplier [.]\u201d  Groupon I , 2020 WL 1900402 at *17 (emphasis added).  Additionally, the \nPTAB also found claim 87 obvious in light of Chelliah in combination with Christensen; in doing so, the PTAB  agreed that  Christensen disclosed the customer\u2019s \u201cabi lity to search for \npromotions by brand name [.]\u201d  Id.  at *20 (internal quotation marks  and citations  omitted)  \n(emphasis added) .  These do appear to be clear indications from the PTAB that Chelliah and \nChelliah/Christensen disclosed the ability to search for incentive programs by sponsor name.   \nAs for claim 97\u2019s limitation that requires searching by type of promotion, Defendant \nnoted that the PTAB found c laim 87 invalid as obvious and, in doing so, \u201cfound that it would \nhave been obvious to search by program type.\u201d  (D.I. 118 at 13 (emphasis in original))  More specifically, in IPR2019- 00061, when assessing claim 87\u2019s limitation t hat the method include a \n\u201cconsumer request to search for promotions from  among a plurality of promotions offered to the \nconsumer by a plurality of sponsors [,]\u201d the PTAB agreed that Christ ensen  revealed  the limitation \nbecause it disclosed the customer\u2019s ability to search for promotions by \u201c category [.]\u201d  Groupon I , \n2020 WL 1900402, at *20 (emphasis added ).  And in  IPR2019- 00044, t he PTAB also found the \nlimitation disclosed in light of Kelly and Stanek , in that Kelly \u201cdisclos[ed] presenting \u2018a 33 \n consumer with icons representing a variety of games, and the ability to cause the system to \nretrieve available games in order to make a selection ,\u2019\u201d and so \u201cit would have been obvious  \u2018to \nemploy this existing search functionality to also deliver game categories  to the participants, \ngiven its usefulness in permitting selections where the re are a large number of potential games \navailable of differing types.\u2019 \u201d  Groupon II , 2020 WL 1900398, at *15 (citation s omitted ) \n(emphasis added) .  These also appear to be clear indications from the PTAB that \nChelliah/Christensen and Kelly/Stanek  disclose d the ability to search for incentive programs by \npromotion type .   \nPlaintiff did not respond to these arguments at all  in its briefing or at oral argument.  In \nlight of that, and in light of the analysis set out above, the Court agrees with Defendant  that the \nlimitations added by claims 96 and 97 are found in the same prior art that invalidated claim 87.  Thus, the se additional limitations in Claims 96 and 97 do not materially alter the question of \ninvalidity , such that collateral estoppel appl ies.  See  Chrimar Sys., Inc. v. Ruckus Wireless, Inc., \nCase No. 16- cv-00186- SI, 2020 WL 4431787, at *5- 6 (N.D. Cal. July 31, 2020)  (concluding that \nthe patentee was collaterally estopped from litigating amended claim 145 , which included the \nrequirement that a \u201cBaseT Ethernet hub\u201d be utilized, because in concluding that claim 1 of the patent was invalid, the PTAB had explained that a r eference ( \u201cHunter \u201d) disclose d use of such a \nhub, and Hunter and another reference would ot herwise render amended claim 145  obvious) . \nThis leaves Newly Asserted Claims 92 and 93, which depend from Newly Asserted \nClaim 91 .  Above, the Court concluded that Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from pursuing claim \n91 in light of the PTAB\u2019s determinati on that claims 7 and 87 were invalid in light of Chelliah, \nChelliah/Christensen, Kelly/Stanek and Kelly/Wong.  Claims 92 and 93 add to claim 91 the very same additional limitations found in c laims 96 and 97\u2014that is, claim 92 adds a limitation that 34 \n the method receives a request to search for incentive programs by sponsor name , while Claim 93 \nadds that the request requires searching by program type .  (D.I. 118 at 21; ' 660 patent , \nReexamination Certificate, col. 6:58 -67)  Give n the application of collateral estoppel to c laims \n96 and 97 in light of the disclosures in certain of the invalidating art listed above , the Court \nsimilarly concludes that Plaintiff is also estopped from asserting c laims 92 and 93.  Like  with  \nclaims 96 an d 97, Plaintiff did not make any argument regarding material differences found in \nclaims 92 and 93, and the Court sees none.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThis is one of those (perhaps somewhat rare) circumstances  where, even at the motion to \ndismiss stage, a defendant has demonstrated that a plaintiff is collaterally estopped from asserting certain patent claims in light of the PTAB\u2019s decision that other (slightly -differently -\nworded) claims of the same patent were invalid.  D efendant here made fulsome arguments as to \nwhy any differences in the Newly Asserted Claims and Invalidated Claims did not materially \nalter the question of invalidity.  An d Plaintiff did not provide much in the way of response.  \nThus, f or the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant\u2019 s Motion.   \nPlaintiff did not seek to amend its Operative Complaint  in lieu  of dismissal , and the C ourt \nhas not been provided with an example as to how amendment would be anything other than a \nfutile exercise.  So, the Court further rules that the operative complaint be dismis sed WITH \nPREJUDICE . \nAn appropriate Order will issue. "}
