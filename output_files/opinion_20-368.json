(D.I. 32, D.I. 34).  The motions \nto quash are DENIED. \nAs to Tuong, the Government has given more than the required notice.  If the date \nselected conflicts with Tuong\u2019s counsel\u2019s schedule, the Court expects that the parties will agree on a different date around the same time period.   \nAs to both, the noticed deponents assert that they will assert the fifth amendment to all \nquestions.  But the law is clear that this is not a basis to quash a deposition notice.  \nIt is apparent, therefore, that a witness cannot relieve hi mself of the duty to answer \nquestions that may be put to him by a mere blanket invocation of the privilege. . . . By \ndenying the availability of a blanket fifth amendment privilege, we in no way limit the \nscope of an individual's fifth amendment rights and avoid the possibility of prejudice to \nthe civil litigant. The civil party retains the right to ask th e question and the witness \nreceives the full protection of the right against self -incrimination. . . . We conclude that \nthe district court erred because the privilege against self -incrimination in a civil \nproceeding may not be asserted prior to the propounding of the questions.
