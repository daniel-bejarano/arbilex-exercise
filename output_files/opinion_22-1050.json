NEWMAN,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1050- RGA  \n      : THE CHRISTINA SCHOOL DISTRICT , :  \n      :   Defendant.    : \n \n Shantell Newman, New Castle, Delaware.   Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n    December  14, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Shantell Newman appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4).  She  commenced this action on August 10, 2022. \n2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).    \nPlaintiff claims jurisdiction by reason of a United States  government defendant.  \n(D.I. 2 at 3).   The Christina School District  is the sole defendant .  (Id. at 2).   \n This action concerns a 1953 time capsule.  The Court takes judicial notice that \nthe time capsule was discovered on August 3, 2021 at a construction site on Christina \nSchool District property , and a press release advised the public that the contents of the \ntime capsule would be revealed at the August 9, 2021 Christina School District Board of \nEducation meeting.   See  https://www.christinak12.org/site  (last visited Dec. 9, 2022).   \nThe notice stated, \u201cAll are welcome to attend.  The meeting will be held in- person . . . \nand live streamed.\u201d   Id.   \n Plaintiff alleges that the content s from the time capsul e were only show n to some \nof the public since the doors were locked even thought it was a public event.  (D.I. 2 at \n4).  Plaintiff alleges that the contents of the time capsule should be restored \u201cto the \npeople\u201d and placed in a museum.  ( Id. at 5).    2 \n  Plaintiff seeks $100,000,000 in damages or  return of the capsule \u201c to the people\u201d  \nbecause it should not be owned by Defenda nt.  (Id . at 7).  \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, h er \npleading is liberally construed and her Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94.    \nA complaint is not automati cally frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .   \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id.   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)  is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to st ate a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provision s of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71915, the C ourt must grant 3 \n Plaintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.   \nSee Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts suffi cient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014) .  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id . at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they  plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n This Court does not have jurisdiction.   \nPlaintiff indicates the basis for jurisdiction i s a United States government  \ndefendant ( i.e., the United States, a federal official, or federal agency) .  (D.I. 2 at 3 ).  \nThe sole defendant is the Christina School Di strict.  The District is not a United States 4 \n Government defendant.   The Court takes judicial notice that the Christina School District \nis as a Delaware public school system  that serves the City of Newark and its \nsurrounding suburban areas as well as the Ci ty of Wilmington.   See  \nhttps://www.christinak12.org/domain/51 (last visited Dec. 12, 2022).   In addition, I have \nreviewed the Complaint and it does not raise a federal civil claim for violations of the \nUnited States Constitution or federal statutes. See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The Court does \nnot have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.  \n In light of the foregoing, there is no basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction \nover the matter.  Therefore, the Complaint will be dismissed without prejudice for lack  of \nsubject matter jurisdiction .      \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court  will dismiss the Complaint wit hout prejudice for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.   \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22 -1050- RGA  \n      : THE CHRISTINA SCHOOL DISTRICT,  :  \n      :   Defendant.    :  \n \n \nORDER  \n \n At Wilmington this 14th day of  December , 2022 , for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that:  \n 1. The Complaint is DISMISSE D without prejudice for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.  \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.  \n  \n                    /s/ Richa rd G.
