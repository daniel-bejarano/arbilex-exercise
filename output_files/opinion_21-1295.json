Sharp, Arlington, VA  \u2013 Pro Se  Plaintiff  \n                      \n     March  28, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware  1 \nNOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \n Plaintiff Daryl M. Sharp (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) filed this action on September 13, 2021, and amended \nthe Complaint on September 30, 2021.  (D.I. 2, 5).  The Amended Complaint is the operative \npleading.  (D.I. 5).  Plaintiff appears pro se  and has been granted leave to proceed in forma \npauperis .  (D.I. 4).   This Court proceeds to screen the Amended Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b).   \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff names the following Defendants : Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of the Archdiocese \nof New York ; William Koenig, Bishop of the Diocese of Wilmington, Delaware ; Jose Gomez \nVelasco, Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles ; and Blas e Cupich, Archbishop of the \nArchdiocese of Chicago .  As alleged, \u201cthe case charges massive theft of government funding \ndirected to the Catholic organization\u201d and \u201cmanipulation of the teaching Manuel  the Bible in  \nviolation [of] Title 18 1091.\u201d   (D.I. 5 at 2).  Plaintiff alleges  he suffered  gunshot injuries and seeks \n\u201c500 trillion dollars per state, island, province, country, and military branch of service f rom every \nCatho lic bank account  on the planet to be returned to this country and countries around the globe  \nand the termination of the Vatican and those tied to it.\u201d   (Id. at 7) . \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defenda nt who is immune from such \nrelief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013); see also  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in \nforma pauperis  actions).   The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favo rable to a pro se  plaintiff.  See Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 2 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because Plaintiff \nproceeds pro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his Amended Complaint, \u201chowever \ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \nlawyers.\u201d  Erickson , 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.  See Dooley v. \nWetzel , 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020)  (quoting Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989) ); \nsee also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002).  \u201c Rather, a claim is \nfrivolous only where it depends \u2018 on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory \u201d or a \u201c clearly baseless \u201d \nor \u201cfantastic or delusional \u201d factual scenario. \u2019\u201d  Dooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell \nv. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327- 28).  \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions.  See Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999)  \n(applying Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)).  B efore dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court , however,  \nmust grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.  See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.  \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).  Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint \nmust do more than simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the 3 elements of a cause of action.\u201d  Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(inter nal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.  See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC , 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcro ft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \nand Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim \nhas substantive plausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may \nnot be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 10.   \nUnder the pleading regime established by Twombly  and Iqbal , a court reviewing the \nsufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations,  \nassume their veracity and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  \nSee Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016); see also  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -\nspecific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n Although this Court construes pro se  filings liberally, Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at 94 \n(quoting Estelle v. Gamble . 429 U.S. 97, 104- 05 (1976)), Plaintiff\u2019s  Amended  Complaint states no \nrecognizable causes of action.  Plaintiff alleges violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091, a federal statute that criminalizes the genocide of members of a religious group.  Plaintiff, however, lacks stand ing \nto impose criminal liability upon D efendants pursuant to the criminal statute  upon which he relies .  4 See Allen v. Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts , 270 F. App\u2019 x 149, 150 (3d Cir. 2008); \nsee United States v. Friedland, 83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996)  \n In addition, this Court finds that the Amended Complaint contains fantastical and/or \ndelusional claims that are insufficient to withstand the Court\u2019s evaluation for frivolity dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  See Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32- 33 (1992) (complaint may \nbe dismissed as lacking a  basis in fact if premised upon allegations that are fanciful, fantastic, and \ndelusional); Golden v. Coleman, 429 F. App\u2019x 73 (3d Cir. 2011).  Finally , this Court takes judicial \nnotice  that Plaintiff  has filed the same or similar  actions against the Cathol ic hierarchy  in other \ndistrict courts and those  actions were also dismissed as frivolous.  See Sharp v. Dolan, 810 F. \nApp\u2019x 14 (D.C. Cir. 2020)  (affirming dismissal of case on the grounds that the allegations  are \nfrivolous); Sharp v. Dolan,  C.A.  No. 17- 341-FtM-99MRM, 2017 WL 3048969 (M.D. Fl. July 19, \n2017 ( dismissing case  as frivolous, for lack o f jurisdiction or venue and noting it is duplicat ive of \na case filed in the District of Columbia) .  \n After thoroughly reviewing the Amended Complaint and applicable law, th is Court draws \non its judicial experience and common sense and finds that the claims are frivolous.  The Amended Complaint will be dismissed.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the above reasons, th is Court will dismiss the Amended Complaint as frivolous \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  Amendment is  futile.  \n An appropriate Order will be entered.  \n  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nDARYL M.

No. 21- 1295 (MN)  \n \nORDER \n \n At Wilmington, this 28th  day of March , 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date,  \n IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n 1. The Amended Complaint is DISMISSED  as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a71915(e)(2)(B)(i).   Amendment is futile.  \n 2.
