No. 20-1509- CFC -JLH \n  \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nPlaintiff Viking Technologies, LLC (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cViking\u201d) filed this patent infringement \nsuit against Defendants SquareTrade Inc. and SquareTradeGo, Inc.  (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d or \n\u201cSquareTrade \u201d), alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,888,953 (\u201c\u2019953 patent\u201d) and \n10,220,537 (\u201c\u2019537 patent\u201d).  Pending before the Court is SquareTrade \u2019s motion to dismiss \nPlaintiff \u2019s First Amended Complaint.  (D.I. 17.)   \n For the reasons stated below, I recomme nd that S quareTrade \u2019s motion be DENIED.  \nI.  BACKGROUND  \nViking  filed this patent infringement action against Defendant SquareTrade Inc.  on \nNovember 9, 2020.  ( D.I. 1.)  On February 26, 2021, Viking  filed a First Amended C omplaint  \n(\u201cFAC\u201d)  that added Defendan t SquareTradeGo, Inc .  (D.I. 14.)   The FAC has two counts.  Count \nI alleges that , \u201c[o]n information and belief, Defendants have infringed and continue to infringe one \nor more claims of the \u2019953 Patent, including but not limited to Claims 1 and 8, pursuant to 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(g), by selling in, offering to sell in, using in, or importing into the United States \ndisplay assemblies manufactured or otherwise produced using a process that practices at least one \nclaimed method of the \u2019953 Patent.\u201d  ( D.I. 14 \u00b6 27.)  Count II refers to claims 1 and 9 of the \u02bc537 2 patent and contains similar allegations.   \nThe \u02bc953 and \u02bc537 patents  disclose methods of removing damaged  glass cover s from \nmobile phone displays so that replacement glass can be attached .1  Claim 1  of the \u02bc953 patent  \nrecites:   \n1.  A method of removing a protective glass top surface  \nfrom a display unit having a glass top, an electronic display \nportion, and an intermediate layer therebetween , the display \nunit defining an axis extending along said intermediate layer , \nthe method comprising the steps of:  \nfixing the display unit in a carriage with the intermediate  \nlayer being exposed on all sides;  \naligning a cutting device in a coplanar relationship with the \nintermediate layer;  \nbiasing the cutting devi ce in the intermediate layer  adjacent \nthe electronic display portion and away from the glass, \ndriving the cutting device into the intermediate layer while \nmoving the cutting device and display unit relative to each other along a diagonal direction relative  to said \ndisplay unit axis;  \nadvancing the cutting device into the intermediate layer to \nseparate the glass top from the electronic display portion. \n \nClaim 8 of the \u02bc953 patent covers a similar metho d, a notable difference being that it requires \nheating and cooling portions of the cutting blade. \n Claim 1 of the \u02bc537 patent recites : \n1.  A method of removing a protective glass top surface  \nfrom a display unit having a glass top, an electronic display \nportion, and a  planar  intermediate layer therebetw een, the \nmethod comprising the steps of : \nfixing the display unit in a carriage with the intermediate \nlayer being exposed on all sides;  \naligning a cutting device in a coplanar relationship with the \nintermediate layer;  \nbiasing the cutting device in the inter mediate layer adjacent \nthe electronic display portion and away from the glass ; \n \n 1 I attempt to describe the invention in a way that facilitates ease of understanding.  In so doing, \nI make some generalizations.  Nothing I say here should be taken as the Court\u2019s views on any \ncurren t or future claim construction (or any other) issues. 3 driving the cutting device into the intermediate layer    \nwhile moving the cutting device and display unit \nrelative to each other along a n axis generally orthogonal \nto the cutti ng device; and  \nadvancing the cutting device into the intermediate layer to \nseparate the glass top from the electronic display \nportion. \n \nClaim 9 is substantially similar but refers to a cutting wire rather than a cutting device.   \n The FAC alleges  that Defendants infringe the asserted claims \u201cby selling, offering to sell, \nusing and/or importing display assemblies that are remanufactured by removing the glass cover from the underlying display for display assemblies for smartphones and tablets at its phone  repair \nand remanufacture facilities.\u201d  (D.I. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 28 , 38.)  The FAC further alleges that the claimed \nmethods are the \u201cmost common method[s] of performing high volume remanufacture of display \nassemblies for,  as examples, Samsung smartphone/tablet (e.g, Ga laxy S7, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S9, \nGalaxy S10, Galaxy Note 7, Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy Note 9, Galaxy Note 10) display assemblies \nand Apple  smartphone/tablet (e.g, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, \niPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPad, iPad Mini) display assemblies .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 44.)  \n On March 22, 2021, Defendants moved to dismiss the FAC for failure to state a claim.  \n(D.I. 17.)  The motion was fully briefed  (D.I. 18; D.I. 19; D.I. 20) and both sides requested \nargument.  (D.I. 22; D.I. 23.)   The Court heard argument on August  20, 2021.  ( \u201cTr. _.\u201d )   \nI recommend that the motion to dismiss be DENIED. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Pr ocedure \n12(b)(6)  for failure to state a claim.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018 state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  4 Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007) ).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains  \u201cfactual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged. \u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).   A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.  \u201cWhere \na complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant's liability, it \u2018stops short of \nthe line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. \u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint under the plausibility standard, all \u201cwell -\npleaded facts\u201d  are assumed to be true , but legal conclusions are not.  Id. at 679.  \u201c[W]hen the \nallegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic \ndeficiency should  be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the \nparties an d the court.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at  558 (internal marks omitted).   \n\u201cLiability under \u00a7 271(g) is subject to the same pleading standard as direct infringement \nunder \u00a7 271(a).\u201d   Everlight Elecs. Co. v. Bridgelux, Inc., No. 17-03363- JSW, 2017 WL 10447905, \nat *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2017)  (quoting Anza Tech . v. D-Link Sys ., Inc., No. 16- 1263, 2016 WL \n8732647, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 11, 2016) ).  According to the Federal Circuit, a complaint \nsufficiently pleads direct infringement when it puts the defendant \u201con notice of what activity .\u202f.\u202f. is being accused of infringement.\u201d  Nalco Co. v. Chem -Mod, LLC , 883 F.3d 1337, 1350 (Fed. Cir. \n2018) (quoting K-Tech Telecomm s., Inc. v. Time Warner Cable, Inc., 714 F.3d 1277, 1284 (Fed. \nCir. 2013)); see also  BioM\u00e9rieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc., No. 18- 21-LPS, 2018 WL 4603267, at *3 \n(D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \nDefendants argue that the FAC should be dismissed beca use it  (1) \u201cdoes not sufficiently 5 allege that the remanufacturing process performs all steps of the [] Asserted Claims\u201d (D.I. 18 at 8 \u2013\n11, 16\u201318) ; (2) \u201cfails to attribute any specific misconduct to either Defendant \u201d (id. at 12) ; (3) \u201cfails \nto allege [Plaintiff]  gave Defendants notice of infringement before filing,\u201d as required for presuit \ndamages under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(b)(2)  (id. at 14) ; and (4) fails to plausibly allege infringement \nunder \u00a7 271(g) because the accused devices are not \u201cmade\u201d by the patented process es and are \n\u201cmaterially changed\u201d by subsequent processes (id. at 18 \u201319).  I take each argument in turn. \nA. Sufficiency of the Infringement  Allegations  \nAssuming the facts alleged in the FAC  to be true, I conclude that  Viking has barely met \nthe low threshold for alleging infringement of the asserted patents . \nThe FAC alleges  that Defendants are in the business of \u201cproviding remanufactured display \nassemblies for smartphones and tablets through their mobile device repair facilities and/or \noperations in the United States, and by mail -in service .\u201d  (D.I. 14 \u00b6 \u00b6 27, 37.)   It identifies particular \ndevices containing display assemblies that can be remanufactured using the patented process.  ( Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 34, 44.)  It alleges  that the most frequently damaged component of mobile devices is the  glass \ncover .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14.)   It alleges that the claimed  method s are the most common and cost -effective  \nmethod s of remanufacturing mobile  display  assemblies . (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 44.)  It also a lleges that the \naccused remanufacturing process meets  the limitations of claim 1 of the \u02bc953 patent and claim 1 \nof the \u02bc537 patent  (though the  FAC allegations are similar to the claim language) .2   \n \n  2 See, e.g., D.I. 14 \u00b6 42 (\u201cClaim 1 of the \u2019537 Patent requires \u2018driving the cutting device \ninto the intermediate layer while moving the cutting device and display unit relative to each other \nalong an axis generally orthogonal to the cutting device.\u2019 In the accused remanufacturing \nprocesses, the cutting device is guided into the optically transparent adhesive layer (\u2018the intermediate layer\u2019). To cut through the adhesive layer, the cutting device is use d like a saw, either \nin a reciprocating fashion (e.g., with the back and forth motion typical of a handsaw) or unidirectionally (e.g., with the continuous movement typical of a bandsaw). The cutting device is driven into the optically transparent adhesive layer (\u2018the intermediate layer\u2019) and advanced through \nthe adhesive layer by moving the cutting device and the display assembly relative to each other such that, under operator control, the movement of the centerline of the cutting wire is generally at a ri ght angle (\u2018orthogonal\u2019) relative to the display assembly.\u201d). 6 Those  allegations are sufficient  to provide Defendants notice of the grounds on which \nPlaintiff\u2019s claims rest .  Defendants are on sufficient notice of what portion of their business \u2014\nmobile device repair \u2014and what specific pro ducts \u2014those that have had the display  assemblies \nrepaired/remanufactured \u2014are accused of infringement .  This is not complicated technology, and \nthe FAC sufficiently identifies  the type of conduct  that is alleged to be infringing.   \nDefendants contend that the FAC lacks sufficient facts to suggest that Defendants\u2019 products \nwere remanufactured using the claimed method, as opposed to some other method.  But there is \nno requirement that a plaintiff plead facts establishing that each limitation of an asserted claim is \nmet.  Nalco , 883 F.3d at 1350.  Moreover, pleading on information and belief is permissible where, \nas here , the requisite facts are particularly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge and control.  Acera \nSurgical, Inc. v. Nanofiber Sols., LLC , No. 20- 980-CFC -JLH, 2021 WL 3187374, at *3 (D. De l. \nJuly 28, 2021), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 3375896 (D. Del. Aug. 2, 2021) ; \nBioM\u00e9rieux , 2018 WL 4603267, at *4 (\u201c Plaintiffs cannot be charged with knowing, at the time \nthey drafted their Complaint, non- public information they could only obtain after filing suit and \nobtaining discovery.\u201d).   \nDefendants point out that the FAC does not contain allegations for every claim  identified  \nin the FAC.  But there  is no such requirement under the law, nor would that be a basis to dismiss \nthe enti re FAC.     \n I do not recommend dismissal on the basis that Viking has failed to sufficiently allege \ninfringement . \nB. Sufficiency of the Allegations  Against Each Defendant  \nDefendants next argue that the FAC is subject to dismissal because it fails to speci fy which \nDefendant did what.  I disagree. The FAC  alleges that both Defendant s infringed under 35 U.S.C. 7 \u00a7 271(g) by selling and import ing display assemblies  that were produced using the patented \nprocess.   See Acera , 2021 WL 3187374, at *4; Align Tech., Inc. v. 3Shape A/S, 339 F. Supp. 3d \n435, 447 (D. Del. 2018)  (\u201c[Plaintiff] is alleging that both of the Defendants did everything. The \nallegations must at this stage, be taken as true. Time will tell if plaintiff can prove them.\u201d).  I also \nnote that there is no requirement under  \u00a7 271(g) that a single entity perform all the steps of the \npatented process.  Syngenta Crop Prot., LLC v. Willowood, LLC , 944 F.3d 1344, 1363 (Fed. Cir. \n2019), cert. denied , 141 S. Ct. 236 (2020) .   \nC. Sufficiency of Presuit N otice  Allegations  \nDefendants next contend that , pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(b)(2),3 Plaintiff cannot obtain \npresuit damages under \u00a7 271(g) because the FAC fails to allege that Defendants had presuit notice \nof infringement.   \nIt is challenging to assess  Defendants\u2019 argument  because their papers are inconsistent about \nwhat they a re asking the Court to do.  Their motion, proposed order , and briefing all ask  the Court \nto \u201cdismiss\u201d the FAC \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d  (D.I. 17 (motion and propose d order); D.I. 18 at 19.)  But \nDefendants\u2019 briefs and oral presentation  focused entirely  on their contention that  Plaintiff is  not \nentitled to \u201cpresuit damages ,\u201d suggesting that Defendants really want  the Court to hold that presuit \ndamages are not availabl e, not dismiss the whole action.4  (D.I. 18 at 14\u201316; D.I. 20 at 2\u20133; Tr. \n \n3 Section 287(b)(2) provides that \u201c[n] o remedies for infringement under section 271(g) shall \nbe available with respect to any product in the possession of, or in transit to, the person subject t o \nliability under such section before that person had notice of infringement with respect to that \nproduct.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(b)(2). \n \n4 Defendants cite Icon Laser Solutions, LLC v. Abercrombie & Fitch, Co., No. 15- 3308, \n2016 WL 7379138, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 13, 2016) for the proposition that courts can \u201cdismiss[] \nor limit[] relief\u201d for a \u00a7 271(g) claim where the complaint fails to allege presuit notice.  (D.I. 18 at \n15.)  But Icon is distinguishable at least for the reason that the patent in that case wa s expired.  \nIcon, 2016 WL 7379138, *1\u20134.  Because there could be no ongoing infringement, the lack of \npresuit notice meant that there were no damages, and the court dismissed the case.  That is not the \nsituation here.  The asserted patents in this case are  not expired and Defendants are now on notice 8 77:16\u201317 (\u201c [P]resuit damages should be dismissed with prejudice\u201d),  102:2\u20135.)  \nFor its part, Plaintiff argues that its failure to plead presuit notice under \u00a7 287(b)(2) should \nnot res ult in the complete dismissal of its \u00a7 271(g) claims.  I agree with that , and Defendants don\u2019t \nseriously contend otherwise.  Thus, Defendants\u2019 request  (in its motion and proposed order)  to \ndismiss the FAC with prejudice should be  denied.  \n At oral argument, counsel for Defendants suggested that their main concern was limiting \nthe scope of discovery  to the time period after they received notice of infringement .  (Tr. 76:19\u2013\n77:7.)   I appreciate Defendants\u2019 concern , but I  do not  recommend grant ing relief not requested in \nDefendants\u2019 motion.  T here are procedures for  dealing with disproportiona l requests for discovery, \nand Defendants may utilize them if a dispute  arises.   Defendants are also free to move for summary \njudgment at the appropriate ti me on the issue of presuit damages.   \nD. Whether the Accused Devices are \u201cMade\u201d  by a Patented Process  \nFinally, Defendants contend that the accused remanufactured display assemblies are not \n\u201cmade \u201d by a patented process within the meaning of \u00a7 271(g) .  The term \u201cmade\u201d as used in \n\u00a7 271(g) means to \u201cmanufacture,\u201d and \u201cextends to the creation or transformation of a product, such \nas by synthesizing, combining components, or giving raw materials new properties.\u201d  Momenta \nPharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA Inc., 809 F.3d 610, 617 (Fed. Cir. 2015).   \nDefendants argue that the remanufactured display assemblies are not \u201cmade\u201d because the \n \nof them.   \nDefendants also cite Seoul Viosys Co. v. P3 Int \u2019l Corp., No. 16- 6276 (AJN), 2018 WL \n4759744, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2018), aff\u2019d on reh\u2019g, 2019 WL 3858621 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, \n2019), aff\u2019d, 810 F. App\u2019x 903 (Fed. Cir. 2020), but the court in that case (1) was not ruling on a \nmotion to dismiss and (2) granted summary judgment on a \u00a7 271(g) claim where the undisputed \nfacts showed that all of the accused acts of importation occurred before the defendan t received \nnotice of infringement, thus precluding damages.  Here, we are not at the summary judgment stage and Defendants are alleged to be ongoing infringers. 9 asserted patents cover disassembling a display, not  making one.  But it is at least plausible that \nremoving a glass cover on a mobile device (in order to put a new one on)  might  constitute the \ntransformation of a product  sufficient to  satisfy \u00a7 271(g) .  Without  further factual development  \nregarding the nature of the accused products , I\u2019m disinclined to conclude  as a matter of law th at \nthey are not made using the patented process.    \nDefendants cite the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion in Bayer AG v. Housey Pharm aceuticals , \nInc., but that case merely says that \u201cfor a product to have been \u2018 made by a process patented in the \nUnited States \u2019 it must have been a physical article that was \u2018manufactured \u2019 and that the production \nof information is not covered.\u201d  340 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003) .  That case doesn\u2019t answer \nthe question here, as the accused display assemblies are physical article s.   \nDefendants also point to the statutory exclusion of a product  otherwise covered by  \u00a7 271(g) \nwhen \u201c(1) it is materially changed by subsequent processes; or  (2) it becomes  a trivial and \nnonessential component of another product.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g) .  D efendants suggest that \nrefurbishing a glass -less display with new glass constitutes a material change.  However, the \n\u201cmaterially changed\u201d provision \u201c involves factual issues not appropriate for resolution in a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion.\u201d   Kyowa Hakka Bio, Co. v . Ajinomoto Co., No. 17- 313, 2018 WL 834583, at *9 \n(D. Del. Feb. 12, 2018)  (citing  Biotec Biologische Naturverpackungen GmbH v. Biocorp, Inc., 249 \nF.3d 1341, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\u201cWhether a change in a product is material is a factual \ndetermination, and  is properly for the trier of fact.\u201d) ).   \nDefendants may ultimately be right  that the accused display assemblies fall outside the \nscope of \u00a7 271(g), but it is premature to make that determination at the motion to dismiss stage  \nwithout further factual development .  Accordingly, I do not recommend dismissal on that basis. \n  10 IV.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 17) \nbe DENIED.    \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
