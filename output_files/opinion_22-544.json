SMITH,\n\nPetitioner,\n\nVv. : Civil Action No. 22-544-GBW\n\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nLeroy L. Smith. Pro se Petitioner.\n\nOctober \\\\ , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nEW hw,\n\nWilliams, District Judge:\n\nPending before the Court is a Petition For A Writ Of Habeas Corpus\nPursuant To 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) filed by Petitioner Leroy L. Smith\n(\u201cPetitioner\u201d). (D.L. 1) For the reasons discussed, Petitioner is ordered to show\ncause why the instant Petition should not be dismissed as an unauthorized second\nor successive petition and for being time-barred.\n\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nThe following background is taken verbatim from Smith v. Holden, 2014\n\nWL 4058789, at *1-2 (D. Del. Aug. 14, 2014):\nA. 1969 Crime\n\nIn 1969, Petitioner was convicted of assault with intent to\ncommit rape. Although he was sentenced to four years of\nincarceration, Petitioner was released less than two years\ninto his sentence on May 24, 1971. He never reported to\nhis probation officer and disappeared.\n\nB. 1971 Crime\n\nOn July 17, 1971, nineteen year old B.J. was alone in her\napartment. Petitioner, who was unknown to her, forced\nhis way into the apartment and raped her. B.J. delayed\nreporting the offense for two days because Petitioner\nthreatened to kill her if she reported it to the police.\nPetitioner later said of the crime: \u201cMy sister lived next\ndoor to this girl. I forced my way into her apartment. I\nwas drinking and I don\u2019t remember too much. I don\u2019t\nremember what I did.\u201d When Petitioner committed this\nrape, he was still on parole from his 1969 conviction for\nassault with intent to commit rape.\nIn 1972, Petitioner was convicted of raping B.J. and\nsentenced to life imprisonment. The Delaware Supreme\nCourt reversed that decision in 1974. Thereafter, Petitioner\nentered a plea to the lesser offense of assault with intent to\ncommit rape. He was sentenced to ten years. Midway\nthrough his sentence, Petitioner was conditionally\nreleased. Five months after his conditional release was\ngranted, Petitioner committed the 1980 crimes described\nbelow.\n\nC. 1980 Crimes\n\nDuring the late afternoon on Wednesday, March 19, 1980,\nsixteen year-old S.M. was walking in the area of Third and\nUnion Streets in Wilmington. Petitioner approached her\nand introduced himself with a phony name. He asked S.M.\nif she wanted to smoke some marijuana but she refused his\noffer and kept walking until she entered a nearby school.\nA short while later, when she was leaving the school,\nPetitioner grabbed S.M. She struggled to free herself.\nPetitioner began choking her, told her he had a gun, and\nthat he would kill her if she did not do as he asked.\nPetitioner forced S.M. to some neighboring garages and\ntold her to pull down her pants so that he could look at her\nnaked body. At this point, a male friend of S.M. happened\nupon the two and eventually scared Petitioner away. The\nfriend went to a nearby church to get help. The police\nwere called and the crime was reported.\n\nDuring this same time-frame in March 1980, twenty-three\nyear old R.L. was a female taxicab driver working for the\nDiamond Cab Company. At approximately 9:30 p.m. on\nFriday, March 21, 1980, she had just dropped off a rider at\nLancaster Avenue and Ford Avenue when Petitioner\napproached her. Petitioner told R.L. that he had to get to\nwork and wanted her to take him there. RL. told\n\n2\nPetitioner that she was scheduled to pick up another fare\nbut he insisted that he wanted her to drive him to his\ndestination. As Petitioner spoke to R.L., she realized from\nthe odor on his breath that he had been drinking. R.L. tried\nto use his drinking as an excuse for rejecting his fare, but\nPetitioner and his then-present friend cajoled her into\ndriving Petitioner. Petitioner entered the cab and gave\nR.L. an address as his friend walked away.\n\nWhen they reached the location, Petitioner did not get out.\nHe placed a hard object in R.L.\u2019s right side, told her to\ncontinue to drive, and directed her to the foot of East\nSeventh Street in Wilmington. Once at that location,\nPetitioner forced R.L. to have sexual intercourse with him.\nWhen he finished, Petitioner told R.L. to drive to Eighth\nand Walnut Streets, where he got out of the cab. Before\nleaving, however, Petitioner threatened to kill R.L. if she\ntold anyone what he had done to her. R.L. drove back to\nthe cab company, reported the rape, gave the police\nPetitioner\u2019s description, and later identified him in a\nphotographic line-up. Petitioner was apprehended shortly\nafter the crime while he was walking in Wilmington\u2019s East\nSide. Petitioner was still on parole from the 1974\nsentencing when he committed these two offenses.\n\nD. Procedural Background\n\nOn March 22, 1980, Petitioner was arrested for, and\nsubsequently indicted on, inter alia, charges of first degree\nrape and first degree kidnapping as a result of his actions\non March 19 and March 21. Petitioner pled guilty to first\ndegree rape and second degree kidnapping. On September\n26, 1981, the Superior Court sentenced him to life in\nprison with eligibility for probation or parole, plus an\nadditional thirty years imprisonment and the remainder of\nhis previously paroled sentence. Petitioner filed an\napplication to withdraw his guilty plea, which the Superior\n\n3\nCourt denied. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndecision.\n\nIn July 1998, Petitioner filed a motion for post-conviction\nrelief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule\n61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d), which the Superior Court denied\nas time-barred under Rule 61(i)(1).\n\nPetitioner filed applications for parole in 1996, 2000,\n2004, and 2009. The Board of Parole denied all four of\nhis applications.\n\nId.\n\nThe Delaware Board of Parole denied Petitioner\u2019s most recent parole\napplication on August 22, 2018. (See D.I. 1 at 7); see also Smith v. Henderson,\n2021 WL 4593385, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 5, 2021). On May 15, 2019,\nPetitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a petition for a writ of mandamus,\nasking the Superior Court to direct the Board of Parole to \u201crefrain from denying\n[him] parole based on \u2018non-changeable issues\u2019 and to promptly give him a\n\u2018rehearing of the August 21, 2018 hearing.\u201d\u201d Jd. The Superior Court dismissed the\npetition for a writ of mandamus in October 2021, explaining that \u201c[m]andamus will\nnot lie to review the Board of Parole proceedings due to the discretionary nature of\n\nthe Board\u2019s actions.\u201d Jd. at *1. When dismissing Petitioner\u2019s mandamus request,\n\nthe Superior Court provided the following background information:\nSince 1980, [Petitioner] has been serving sentences of life\n\nwith the possibility of parole for rape in the first degree\n\nand 30 years for kidnapping in the second degree.\n\n[Petitioner] has applied for parole on these charges\n\nunsuccessfully a number of times, most recently on\n\nAugust 22, 2018. He is ineligible to apply again for 60\n\nmonths from that date. [Petitioner] alleges that he has\n\nparticipated in a variety of self-help programs over the last\n\n20 years or so and now is being denied parole solely on the\n\nbasis of the nature of his offenses, something that will\n\nnever change.\nId. at *1. Petitioner appealed the Superior Court\u2019s decision, but the Delaware\nSupreme Court dismissed the appeal after Petitioner failed to respond to its notice\nto show cause why he failed to file a timely appeal. See Smith v. Henderson, 272\nA.3d 1163 (Table), 2022 WL 470804, at *1 (Del. Feb. 15, 2022).\n\nIn April 2022, Petitioner filed the Petition presently pending before the\nCourt. (D.I. 1) Petitioner asserts that he has appeared before the Board of Parole\n\u201con several occasions\u201d since 2013, and his parole applications have been denied\nwith stipulations that he must complete specific programs, with the most recent\nbeing a \u201csex offender program\u201d in 2018 lasting two years. (D.I. 1 at 7) Petitioner\ncontends that the Board violated his rights to due process and equal protection by\n\narbitrarily denying his applications, because the denials were based on \u201cissues\n\nwhich will never change.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 5-8)\nIl. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal\nsentences . . . and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal\ncourt may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground\nthat he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). AEDPA imposes procedural requirements\nand standards for analyzing the merits of a habeas petition in order to \u201cprevent\nfederal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state-court convictions are given effect\nto the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002); see\nWoodford, 538 U.S. at 206.\n\nA. Second or Successive Gatekeeping Mechanism\n\nAEDPA \u201ccreated a statutory \u2018gatekeeping mechanism\u2019 for second or\nsuccessive habeas petitions.\u201d In re Hoffner, 870 F.3d 301, 306 (3d Cir. 2017).\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), a petitioner must seek authorization from\nthe appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive habeas\npetition in a district court. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007); Rule\n\n9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. Notably, a petition for habeas relief is not considered to\n\n6\nbe \u201csecond or successive simply because it follows an earlier federal petition.\u201d\nBenchoff v. Colleran, 404 F.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 2005). Rather, a habeas petition\nis classified as second or successive within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 ifa\nprior petition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new petitions challenge\nthe same conviction, and the new petition asserts a claim that was, of could have\nbeen, raised in a prior habeas petition. See Benchoff, 404 F.3d at 817; In re\nOlabode, 325 F.3d 166, 169-73 (3d Cir. 2003). If a habeas petitioner erroneously\nfiles a second or successive habeas petition \u201cin a district court without the\npermission of a court of appeals, the district court's only option is to dismiss the\npetition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\u201d\nRobinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nB. Statute of Limitations\n\nAEDPA imposes a one-year period of limitation on the filing of habeas\npetitions and effectively precludes petitioners from filing a second or subsequent\nhabeas application except in the most unusual of circumstances. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2244(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1),; United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir.\n1999); Mason v. Meyers, 208 F.3d 414 (3d Cir. 2000). When a habeas petition\nchallenges the denial of parole, AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period runs from\n\nthe date of the parole denial. See DeFoy v. McCullough, 301 F. App\u2019x 177, 180\n7\n(3d Cir. 2008) (reiterating that AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period applies to\nhabeas petitions challenging the denial of parole); see also Fernandez v. Estock, \u2014\n2020 WL 8674090, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2020) (explaining that a habeas\npetition challenging the denial of parole must be filed within one year after the\n\u2018denial). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling.\nSee Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may also be excused from failing to\ncomply with the limitations period by making a gateway showing of actual\ninnocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4\" 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021).\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Unauthorized Second or Successive Petition\n\nIn the instant Petition, Petitioner explains that he has appeared before the\nBoard of Parole several times since June 2013, and the Board denied all of his\nrequests to be released on parole based on stipulations to complete specific\nprograms. (D.I. 1 at 7) Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s August 2018 denial of\nhis most recent request to be released on parole violated his due process rights\nbecause the Board did not suggest any specific \u201cmental health, vocational, or\n\neducational programming.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 8) According to Petitioner, the Board\u2019s\ndecision was \u201ccompletely arbitrary [and] divorced [from] any valid reasons. The\ndenial [was] based on issues which will never change.\u201d (d.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s federal habeas petition that was denied in 2014 challenged the\nBoard of Parole\u2019s denial of his fourth request for parole. In that petition, Petitioner\nargued that the Board violated his right to substantive due process because \u201cthe\nfactors articulated by the Board [were] not reasonably or rationally related to\neffective treatment, and the Board should not consider those factors because they\n[were] unchanging.\u201d (See Smith v. Holden, Civ. A. No. 11-288-LPS, D.I. 25 at 6)\nJudge Stark denied Petitioner\u2019s due process challenge to the denial of his parole\napplication as meritless. Id.\n\nThe foregoing comparison demonstrates that Petitioner\u2019s current Petition\nraises the same argument regarding the Board of Parole\u2019s 2018 denial of his most\nrecent parole application that Petitioner presented in his first petition when\nchallenging the denial of his 2009 parole application. Judge Stark denied as\nmeritless Petitioner\u2019s first habeas challenge regarding the denial of parole. Given\nthese circumstances, the Court concludes that the instant Petition constitutes a\nsecond or successive habeas request under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. See e.g., Benchoff,\n404 F.3d at 814 (where the Third Circuit found that because two of petitioner\u2019s\n\nthree parole denials occurred before the petitioner filed his first petition\n9\nchallenging his underlying conviction, the petitioner could have raised the parole\nclaim in that petition, and the instant petition was therefore second or successive);\nLong v. Penn. Bd. Probation and Parole, 2017 WL 3412629, at *2-3 (E.D. Pa.\nAug. 9, 2017) (dismissing as second or successive a petition challenging the Parole\nBoard\u2019s most recent denial of Long\u2019s parole on two of the same constitutional\nbases that he asserted in his previous federal habeas petitions).\n\nPetitioner does not allege, and the record does not indicate, that the Third\nCircuit Court of Appeals authorized the filing of the instant second or successive\nhabeas Petition. Nevertheless, Petitioner will be provided an opportunity to show\ncause why his Petition should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as an\nunauthorized second or successive habeas petition.\n\nB. Untimely Petition\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state\ncourts, including any post-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed\nand pending before the expiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v.\nMeyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). The limitations period is also tolled\nfor the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed\n\neven if the appeal is not eventually filed. Id. at 424. The limitations period,\n10\nhowever, is not tolled for the ninety-day period during which a petitioner may file\na petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment\ndenying a state post-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att\u2019y of Philadelphia,\n247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\nIn this case, the limitations clock started to run on August 23, 2018, and ran\nfor 265 days until Petitioner filed his petition for writ of mandamus on May 15,\n2019. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653 (3d Cir. 2005) (holding that Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 6(a) applies to federal habeas petitions). The petition for writ of\nmandamus statutorily tolled the limitations period from May 16, 2019 through\nNovember 5, 2021, which includes the thirty-day period Petitioner had to appeal\nthe Superior Court\u2019s October 5, 2021 denial of his mandamus petition.\u2019 See \u00a7\n2244(d)(2). When the limitations clock started to run again on November 6, 2021,\nit ran the remaining 100 days without interruption until the limitations period\n\nexpired on February 14, 2022. Petitioner filed the instant Petition in April 2022.\n\n'Petitioner\u2019s untimely appeal only tolled the time during which Petitioner could\nhave sought appellate review because the appeal was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d for\npurposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 423 n.6.\n\n11\nConsequently, the only way for the Petition to be deemed timely filed is if\nequitable tolling applies.\u201d\n\nEquitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the\npetitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2)\nthat some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely\nfiling.\u201d Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence inquiry,\nequitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to the petitioner\u2019s\nexcusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary circumstance\nrequirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be\nextraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with\nrespect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d\n385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary circumstance will only warrant\nequitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal connection, or nexus, between the\nextraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner\u2019s failure to file a timely federal\npetition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). Specifically, \u201cifthe\nperson seeking equitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in\n\nattempting to file after the extraordinary circumstances began, the link of causation\n\n2Given the history of this case, it appears that Petitioner cannot assert a gateway\nclaim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d as a method for excusing his untimely filing.\n12\nbetween the extraordinary circumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the\nextraordinary circumstances therefore did not prevent timely filing.\u201d Brown v.\nShannon, 322 F.3d 768, 773 (3d Cir.2003). The burden is on the petitioner to\nprove that he has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights. See Urcinoli v.\nCathel, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir.2008).\n\nPetitioner does not address the issue of timeliness. Nevertheless, in the\ninterest of justice, Petitioner shall be given an opportunity to show cause why his\nPetition should not dismissed as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). In his\nresponse to this Memorandum Opinion, Petitioner shall state with specificity any\nfacts that may entitle him to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations and why\nhis habeas Petition should not be dismissed as time-barred. An appropriate Order\nfollows.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court has concluded that the instant\nPetition is both an unauthorized second/successive habeas petition and untimely.\nAccordingly, Petitioner shall show cause why his Petition should not be dismissed\nfor lack of jurisdiction as an unauthorized second/successive \u00a7 2254 petition and\n\nfor being time-barred. A separate Order will be entered.\n\n13\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nLEROY L.
