{"case_name": "Webb v. State of Delaware et al", "case_number": "22-461", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "10-31-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDAVID Q. WEBB, )\nPlaintiff,\nv. C.A. No. 22-461-GBW\nSTATE OF DELAWARE, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDavid Q. Webb, Newark, Delaware. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nOctober 3! , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nJE a\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff David Q. Webb commenced this action on April 6, 2022. (D.I. 2)\nHe appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I.\n4) Pending are Plaintiffs request for electronic notification and a motion for an\nemergency temporary restraining order against the State of Delaware. (D.I. 6, 8)\nThe Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(b).\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). The claims revolve around the DHSS-DSCC emergency hotel voucher\nprogram, housing provided Plaintiff, and his apparent termination under the\nprogram in late March 2022. (D.I. 2-1 at 6, D.I. 2-7 at 4) The Complaint names\n16 defendants. They include the State of Delaware, state and county government\nemployees and officials, and several hotels/motels. (D.I. 2 at 1-3; D.L 2-1 at 2-7)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants are either government entities or they\ncontract with government entities; they are direct recipients of federal funding;\nthey engaged in intentional discrimination based upon his race, color, and national\norigin as an African American male; and they violated his rights under the Fourth,\n\nFifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He\n1\nalso alleges Defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nUSS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d et seq., and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq. He\nalleges deliberate ignorance and unlawful housing conditions under federal law.\nFinally, Plaintiff raises supplemental state claims under Delaware law for negligent\nretention of employment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent\ninfliction of emotional distress, and vicarious liability.\n\nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\nforma pauperis actions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is\nliberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to\nless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\n\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n2\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling\non Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\n\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n3\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nUSS. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Title VI\n\nCount I attempts to raise claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. The count fails to set forth plausible claims. The claims\nare pled in a conclusory manner and there are no factual allegations that provide a\nplausible basis to conclude that Defendants State of Delaware, New Castle County\n\n(not a named defendant),! or Matthew Meyer (in his official capacity) intentionally\n\n' Presumably this refers to claims raised against individual County officials or\nemployees in their official capacities.\n4\ndiscriminated against Plaintiff because of Plaintiff's race, color and/or national\norigin as an African American male in violation of Title VI. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2000d; Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001). Therefore, Count I\nwill be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend\nthis count.\n\nB. 42U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n\nCounts II, III, IV, V, and VI attempt to raise claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\n\u201cTo state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right\nsecured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the\nalleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d\nSee West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\n\nCounts II, I, IV, and VI are raised against the State of Delaware and\nindividual State Defendants in their official capacities. In addition, Count II is\nraised against New Castle County Executive Meyer in his official capacity.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution protects an\nunconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its\nown citizens, regardless of the relief sought. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\n517 US. 44, 54 (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89\n(1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). \u201c[A] suit against a state official\n\nin his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit\n5\nagainst the official\u2019s office. As such, it is no different from a suit against the State\nitself.\u201d Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (internal\ncitations omitted); Ali v Howard, 353 F. App\u2019x 667, 672 (3d Cir. 2009).\nAccordingly,\u00a7 1983 claims for monetary damages against a state, state agency, or a\nstate official in his official capacity are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See\nid.\n\nAs mentioned, Count II sues Meyer in his official capacity as County\nExecutive. Plaintiff may sue Meyer in his official capacity under a \u00a7 1983 theory\nof liability only for acts implementing an official policy, practice, or custom. See\nMonell v. Department of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690-94 (1978). To plausibly\nplead Monell liability, a plaintiff must identify the challenged policy \" custom,\nattribute it to the municipality itself, or in this case, a policy established or\nimplemented by Meyer, and show a causal link between execution of the policy\nand the injury suffered. See e.g., O\u2019Bryant v. New Jersey Div. of Child Prot. &\nPermanency, 2022 WL 3339489, at *7 (D.N.J. Aug. 12, 2022). The Complaint\ncontains no such allegations.\n\nThe Court will dismiss Counts II, III, IV, and VI based upon Defendants\u2019\nimmunity from suit and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend the claim raised against Meyer in\nCount II. Amendment is futile as to the claims raised against the State and State\nDefendant employees in their official capacities.\n\nCount V attempts to raise a claim for violation of the Ninth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution. Plaintiff cannot base \u00a7 1983 claims on an alleged\nviolation of the federal Constitution\u2019s Ninth Amendment, because the Ninth\nAmendment \u201cdoes not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a\nproscription of an infringement. ...\u201d Nicolette v. Caruso, 315 F. Supp. 2d 710,\n718 (W.D. Pa. 2003). See also, Bamigbade v. City of Newark, 2005 WL 8175517\n(D.N.J. Aug. 12, 2005) (\u201cA person cannot claim a right that exists solely under the\nNinth Amendment.\u201d).\n\nSection 1983 does not provide redress for violations of state law or the Ninth\nAmendment. Count V does not raise a cognizable claim and, therefore, will be\ndismissed. Amendment is futile as to Count V.\n\nC. Deliberate Ignorance\n\nCount VII alleges deliberate ignorance by State Defendants Magarik,\nBeaman, Hall, and Mixon.\u201d The claim is not cognizable under federal law. Count\n\nVII will be dismissed as frivolous. Amendment is futile.\n\n2 Count VII asserts federal jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\ni\nD. \u2018Fair Housing Act \u00a9\n\nCount VIII raises Fair Housing Act claims against Defendants \u201cDelaware\nState/Federal Contractors [hotel/motel properties \u2014 Best Night Inn, New Castle;\nSuperlodge, New Castle; Red Roof Inn & Suites, New Castle; Red Roof Inn,\nNewark, Budget Inn, New Castle; and all remaining Hotel/Motel Properties as\nState/Federal Contractors of DHSS-DSSC]\u201d. (D.I. 2-1 at 22) Count VIII alleges\nthe foregoing Defendants \u201chave failed to adhere to the strict federal regulatory\nmandates of their properties being safe [crime ridden] clean and livable conditions\n[roaches; mice and bed bugs infection] for DHSS-DSSC clients in the hotel/motel\nrooms while being recipients of federal funding.\u201d (Id. at 22-23) Plaintiff, who was\nhoused at the Red Roof Inn Hotel & Suites, alleges that he was denied housing at\nthe New Caste County Hope Center (presumably better housing). (D.I. 2-1 at 23;\nD.I. 2-3 at 9-14)\n\nThe Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq. makes it unlawful to\n\u201cdiscriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or\nrental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities therewith, because\nof race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3604(b). This includes \u201c[l]imiting the use of privileges, services or facilities\n\nassociated with a dwelling because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial\nstatus, or national origin of an owner, tenant or a person associated with him or\nher.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.65(b)(4).\n\nPlaintiff refers to the Fair Housing Acts\u2019 provisions that prohibit housing\nbecause of race, color, national origin, sex, familial status, and disability, yet the\nallegations do not speak to discrimination based upon any of these protected\ncharacteristics.\n\nIn addition, Count VIII references attached Exhibits 2 and 5. Exhibit 2\ncontains a September 17, 2021 email authored by Plaintiff to Mixon that states he\nis not being provided housing at the Hope Center (Plaintiff previously requested\nhousing there, see D.I. 2-3 at 7-8), solely because he is not a family in violation of\nthe Fair Housing Act and a responsive email from Mixon that Plaintiff was not\ngiven the option of relocating to the Hope Center because its priority for referrals\nto the Hope Center was families and gave Plaintiff the option to work with staff\nshould Plaintiff decide to relocate to another motel. (D.L. 2-3 at 2, 4, 8)\n\nWhile not specified in the Complaint, based upon its attached exhibits it\nseems Plaintiff alleges violations of the Fair Housing Act by reason of his familial\nstatus when he was not provided housing in the place of his choosing. The claim\nfails for several reasons. First, there are no allegations that any of the named\n\nforegoing Defendants had authority to move Plaintiff from one housing location to\nanother. As alleged Plaintiff was a recipient of the DHSS-DSCC emergency hotel\nvoucher program.\n\nSecond, \u00a7 3604 of the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale\nor rental of a dwelling based on \u201crace, color, religion, sex, familial status or\nnational origin.\u201d Section 3602(k) of the Fair Housing Act defines \u201cfamilial status\u201d\nas \u201cone or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being\ndomiciled with (1) a parent or other person having legal custody of such\nindividuals[s]; or (2) the designee of such parent or other person having such\ncustody, with the written permission of such parent or other person.\u201d It is evident\nin reading the statute that the Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination\nagainst families with minor children.\n\nPlaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted as he is a\nsingle homeless male and there are no allegations that he is living with minor\nchildren. His \u201cfamilial status\u201d does not make him a member of a protected group\nwithin the meaning of the Fair Housing Act. Plaintiff, therefore, fails to plead facts\nsufficient to state a claim for discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. Count\nVIII will be dismissed. Amendment is futile.\n\nE. Housing Conditions IX\n\nCount IX is also raised against the same Defendants as those in Count VIII.\n\nPlaintiff appears to attempt to raise a federal claim for unlawful conditions of\n10\nconfinement, similar to those raised by inmates in \u00a71983 cases.? (D.I. 2-1 at 23-\n24) Plaintiff alleges Defendants hotel/motels properties are \u201ccrime-ridden;\nextremely unclean in the common areas and outside on the properties with trash;\ninfested with roaches, mice, bed bugs, lack of proper security and poor insulation\naround doors and windows to the motel rooms allowing extreme cold air in the\nrooms in the winter months and similarly with the extreme heat in the summer\nmonths.\u201d (/d. at 24)\n\nAs best as can be determined from the Complaint and its exhibits, Plaintiff\nhas only been housed only at the Red Roof Inn at Newark, Delaware. Count IX\ndoes not specifically refer to the Red Roof Inn although it does refer to unsafe\nconditions. While Plaintiff states this is a federal claim, the Complaint does not\nrefer to any federal statute allegedly violated. To the extent Plaintiff raises the\nclaim under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1437\u00a3, federal appellate courts that have addressed the issue have held that the Act\ndoes not create a private right to housing of a particular condition or a private\ncause of action to enforce any such right. See Henry v. City of Erie, 728 F.3d 275,\n\n281 (3d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted).\n\n3 Count IX asserts federal jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\n11\nCount IX as pled is deficient and fails to state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted. Therefore, Count IX will be dismissed. Plaintiff will be given leave to\namend Count IX.\n\nF. Claims under Delaware Law\n\n1. Negligence Claims under State Law\n\nCount X alleges Magarik, Beaman, and Hall, in their official capacities, are\nculpable for negligently retaining the employment of Riddick, Lewis, and Draper,\nafter being made aware of their tendencies to harm Plaintiff. (D.I. 2-1 at 24-25)\nCount XII is raised against Magarik, Beaman, Hall, Mixon, Lewis, Riddick,\nDraper, and Whitaker and alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress. (Id. at\n27) Count XII does not indicate if the claims are brought against Defendants in\ntheir individual or official capacities.\n\nAs to the claims raised against Defendants in their official capacities, as\ndiscussed above, they are immune from civil liability under the doctrine of\nsovereign immunity which provides \u201cthat the State may not be sued without its\nconsent.\u201d Doe v. Cates, 499 A.2d 1175, 1176 (Del. 1985).\n\nAs to the claims raised against Defendants in their individual capacities (if\nthat is what Plaintiff intended), Defendants are immune from suit under the\nDelaware State Tort Claims Act, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 4001. The State Tort Claims Act,\n\nshields State employees from civil liability if (1) the State employee\u2019s conduct\n12\narose out of and in connection with the performance of official duties involving the\nexercise of discretion; (2) the act or failure to act was performed in good faith; and\n(3) the act or failure to act was done (or not done) without gross or wanton\nnegligence. 10 Del. C. \u00a7 4001. \u201cThus, immunity under \u00a7 4001 applies to\ndiscretionary acts or omissions done without gross or wanton negligence.\u201d Ward\nvy. Delaware State Police, 2022 WL 351205, at *7 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 4, 2022).\nCounts X and XII merely allege negligence and, therefore, the State Tort Claims\nAct affords Defendants immunity from suit.\n\nCounts X and XII will be dismissed. Amendment is futile.\n\n2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\nCount XI raises intentional infliction of emotion distress claims, as follows:\ne Magarik ignored two urgent pleas of assistance to resolve\n\nemployment and housing complications and this resulted in Plaintiff\nsuffering heart attacks.\nBeaman as set forth in Exhibits 2 and 6.\nHall as set forth in Exhibit 2.\nMixon as set forth in Exhibit 2.\nLewis as set forth in Exhibit 3.\nRiddick as set forth in Exhibits 3 and 7\n\nDraper as set forth in Exhibits 3 and 8.\nWhitaker as set forth in Exhibit 9.\n\nDelaware applies Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 in defining the\n\nelements of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Cummings v. Pinder,\n\n13\n574 A.2d 843, 845 (Del. 1990) (per curiam). That section imposes liability, in\nrelevant part, on \u201cOne who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or\nrecklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such\nemotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily\nharm.\u201d Outrageous conduct is \u201cconduct that exceeds the bounds of decency and is\nregarded as intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d Goode v. Bayhealth Med. Ctr.,\nInc., 2007 WL 2050761, at *2 (Del. July 18, 2007).\n\nCount XI, as pled, fails to state claims for intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. For most Defendants, the Complaint refers to exhibits attached to the\nComplaint without identify what, in those exhibits, is the alleged intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress that cause harm to Plaintiff. The Complaint must\ncontain some facts for the Court to consider in screening this Count. Therefore,\nCount XI will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which relief can be\ngranted. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend Count XI.\n\n3. Vicarious Liability\nCount XIII alleges that the State of Delaware is vicariously liable for the acts\n\nof its employees who allegedly were negligent, willfully negligent, failed to act,\n\n14\nviolated federal laws, had malicious intent, and did not provide Plaintiff vocational\nrehabilitation services for more than ten weeks.*\n\nAs discussed above, all of the Counts have been dismissed. Thus, the\nvicarious liability claims against the State of Delaware are not cognizable. See\nVerrastro v. Bayhospitalists, LLC, 208 A.3d 720, 724 (Del. 2019). In addition,\nSimilar to Count XI, Count XII refers to exhibits attached to the Complaint without\nidentify what, in those exhibits, are the alleged acts for which Plaintiff seeks to\nhold the State of Delaware liable by reason of vicarious liability. The Complaint\nmust contain some facts for the Court to consider in screening this Count.\n\nFor the reasons discussed, Count XIII will be dismissed for failure to state\nclaims upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff will be given leave to amend\nCount XIII.\n\nIV. MISCELLANEOUS MOTIONS\n\nA. Electronic Notification\n\nPlaintiff seeks electronic notification. (D.I. 6) The motion will be denied\nwithout prejudice. It is not clear if Plaintiff moves to file electronically or only\nreceive electronic notification. Regardless, a PACER account is necessary to\n\nreceive electronic notification. The Court requires that Plaintiff indicate he has\n\n4 Count XIII asserts supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 and\npurports to state claims under Delaware law. (D.I. 2-1 at 31)\n15\nindependently reviewed all of the materials and related topics on the Court\u2019s web\nsite related to electronic filing and he must have a PACER account. His motion\ndoes not meet these requirements.\n\nB. Injunctive Relief Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)\n\nPlaintiff seeks an emergency temporary restraining order for Defendants to\ncease and desist the intentional infliction of emotional distress Plaintiff experiences\nevery Wednesday as a DHSS-DSSC client. (D.I. 8) Plaintiff relies upon his\nverified Complaint (D.I. 2) and attachments to the motion to support his claim for\nrelief.\n\nA preliminary injunction is \u201can extraordinary remedy that should be granted\nonly if (1) the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) denial will result in\nirreparable harm to the plaintiff; (3) granting the injunction will not result in\nirreparable harm to the defendant; and (4) granting the injunction is in the public\ninterest.\u201d NutraSweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enterprises, Inc., 176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir.\n1999) (\u201cNutraSweet II\u201d). The elements also apply to temporary restraining orders.\nSee NutriSweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enterprises., Inc., 112 F.3d 689, 693 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(\u201cNutraSweet I\u2019) (a temporary restraining order continued beyond the time\npermissible under Rule 65 must be treated as a preliminary injunction, and must\n\nconform to the standards applicable to preliminary injunctions). \u201c[F]ailure to\n\n16\nestablish any element in [a plaintiff\u2019s] favor renders a preliminary injunction\ninappropriate.\u201d NutraSweet II, 176 F.3d at 153.\n\nThe motion will be denied without prejudice. As just discussed, Plaintiff's\nComplaint does not state cognizable claims. Plaintiff relies upon his Complaint and\nexhibits to the instant motion to support his claim. In reading the motion and\nattachments it is apparent that Plaintiff seeks housing at the Hope Center, but that\nhas not happened. Plaintiff is, however, provided housing. At this juncture, it is far\nfrom clear that Plaintiff will succeed on the merits. Therefore, Plaintiff's motion\nwill be denied without prejudice.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny without prejudice to renew\nPlaintiff's request for electronic notification (D.I. 6); (2) deny without prejudice\nPlaintiff's motion for injunctive relief (D.I. 8); (3) dismiss the Complaint pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (iii); and (4) give Plaintiff leave to amend\nCounts I, II as to Matthew Meyer, IX, XI, and XIII.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n17\n"}
