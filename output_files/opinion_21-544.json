No. 21-544-CFC \nRobert Charles Lewis, Howard R. Young Correctional Institution , Wilmington , Delaware. \nPro Se Plaintiff. \nDecember 17, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION co~i!. ~dge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Robert Charles Lewis filed this action on April 15, 2021.1 (D.I. 2) He \nclaims jurisdiction by reason of a federal question. (D.I. 2 at 3) Plaintiff appears prose \nand has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I. 4) The Court proceeds \nto review and screen the matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b). \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. \n2008). Plaintiff alleges that he was diagnosed with a mental illness in 1989 and that \nDefendant The News Journal Co. took financial advantage of him. (D.I. 2 at 3) He \nalleges that on or about March-April 1990, during a seven month time-frame, he \ndelivered newspapers for Defendant and has yet to be paid. (Id. at 4) He alleges that \nhe was financially and emotionally injured and this led to his wrongful commitment to \nthe Delaware Psychiatric Center and to his divorce. (Id. at 7) \nPlaintiff seeks $1,754 in compensatory damages as well as well as punitive \ndamages. (Id. at 7) \nIll. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n1 Plaintiff is currently held at the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington , \nDelaware. He was not incarcerated when he commenced this action. (See D.I. 2) 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must \naccept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 \n(3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds \npro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint , \"however inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \nlawyers.\" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 \nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 \n(3d Cir. 2002). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an \"indisputably \nmeritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \"fantastic or delusional \" factual \nscenario. \"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523, \n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when deciding Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. See Tourscher v. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard to dismissal for failure to state a claim under\u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B)) . Howeve r, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \n2 A complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in \nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court \nconcludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell \nAt/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations \" \nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \"labels and \nconclusions \" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Davis v. \nAbington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient \nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 \nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that , \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine \nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. \nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" that \nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \n3 Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThe Complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. I have thoroughly \nreviewed the Complaint and it does not raise a federal claim for violations of the United \nStates Constitution or federal statutes. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Nor are the parties \ncitizens of different states as is required for diversity jurisdiction . See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. \nEven if this Court had jurisdiction, the alleged breach of contract claim, governed \nby Delaware law is time-barred . Under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8106, a breach of contract action \nmust be brought within three years from the date that the cause of action accrued. See \nLevey v. Brownstone Asset Mgmt., LP, 76 A.3d 764, 768 (Del. 2013). Here, Plaintiff \nalleges the claim accrued in 1989 and he did not commence this action until 2021, far \nbeyond the limitation period. \nThe Complaint will be dismissed . Amendment is futile. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction \nand as time-barred pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) . Amendment is futile. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nROBERT CHARLES LEWIS, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nTHE NEWS JOURNAL CO., \nDefendant. : Civ. No. 21-544-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this Seventeenth day of December in 2021, consistent with the \nMemorandum Opinion issued this date, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.
