No. 22-193-GBW\n\nVv.\n\nTED SAMMONS, et al.,\n\nNee ee ae ee ee\n\nDefendants.\n\nKevin L. Hines, Pro se Plaintiff.\n\nPenelope B. O\u2019Connell, Esquire, O\u2019 Hagan Meyer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nCounsel for Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDecember \\4 , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n/\nYeo \\\n\nEE , Mao.\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Kevin L. Hines, a prisoner proceeding pro se, commenced this civil\nrights action on February 14,2022. (DI. 1). Before the Court is Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss. (D.J. 31). Also before the Court are Plaintiff\u2019s request for\ncounsel, motion for default judgment, motion for last known or present address of\n\n' and motion for supplemental\n\nunserved defendant, motion for continuance,\njurisdiction. (DI. 19, 29, 34,35, 37). The matters have been briefed.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nIn the Complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Plaintiff alleged the\nfollowing. Prior to the start of his current term of imprisonment, while \u201cout on\nbail,\u201d he checked himself into an inpatient program in the Gaudenzia\nRehabilitation Facility, seeking help for his mental health and substance abuse\ndisorders. Plaintiff alleged that he was subjected to physical and sexual\nharassment and abuse by one member of the Gaudenzia staff and that he was\nfrightened to report the abuse because he was worried that he would be sent back\n\nto jail if he brought attention to himself. Eventually, Plaintiff reported the abuse,\n\nthe staff member was fired, and other staff members retaliated against Plaintiff.\n\n' This \u201cmotion\u201d is simply a response to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, asking the\nCourt to deny the motion to dismiss and proceed to the next stage of litigation.\n\n1\nPlaintiff was ultimately discharged early from the program as part of the\nretaliation.\n\nDefendants move to dismiss the Complaint, arguing that Plaintiff cannot\nstate a claim under \u00a7 1983 because Defendants are all private actors who were not\nacting under color of state law. (D.I.31). In several responsive filings, Plaintiff\nasserted new allegations to argue that Gaudenzia and its employees were operating\nunder color of state law. (D.I. 35, 36,39). These allegations are as follows.\nPlaintiff was on probation when he went to Gaudenzia and would have been sent\nback to prison for any violation of the terms of his probation. His sentencing\norder mandated him to report into the probation office on a weekly basis and be\navailable for random home checks, but those requirements were suspended during\nhis stay at Gaudenzia, a state accredited treatment facility. His counselors at\nGaudenzia were in direct and regular contact with his probation officers during his\nstay in the facility, providing updates on his status. He was told by his probation\nofficers that he was in the custody of Gaudenzia and that he needed to notify his\nprobation officers immediately ifhe left. In one filing, Plaintiff concedes that he\nwas not mandated to receive treatment at Gaudenzia as part of a sentencing order.\n(D.I. 39 at 1). Plaintiff also filed a motion requesting that this Court exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over any related state law claims, though he did not raise\n\nany in his Complaint.\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).\nBecause Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim\nof entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u2019\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,\n241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). The Court is \u201cnot\nrequired to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly alleged in the\ncomplaint.\u201d In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 Gd\nCir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, however, \u201cfor imperfect statement\nof the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\n\nU.S. 10, 11 (2014).\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has\n\u201csubstantive plausibility.\u201d Jd. at 12. That plausibility must be found on the face\nof the complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has\nfacial plausibility when the [complainant] pleads factual content that allows the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the [accused] is liable for the\nmisconduct alleged.\u201d Jd. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial\nexperience and common sense.\u201d Id. at 679.\n\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nAs explained below, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff has\nfailed to allege facts indicating that Defendants acted under color of law, and the\nCourt will therefore grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\n\n\u201cTo state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right\nsecured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the\nalleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). This is a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d and, as such,\n\u201cthere is no liability under \u00a7 1983 for those not acting under color of law.\u201d\nGroman v. Twp. of Manalapan, 47 F.3d 628, 638 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\nTo determine whether a private party was acting under color of state law,\n\ncourts consider whether there is \u201csuch a close nexus between the State and the\nchallenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of\nthe State itself.\u201d Leshko v. Servis, 423 F.3d 337, 339 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal\nquotations omitted). The Third Circuit has articulated three tests to determine\nwhether such a close nexus exists so as to constitute state action: (1) whether the\nprivate entity has exercised powers that are traditionally the exclusive prerogative\nof the state; (2) whether the private party has acted with the help of or in concert\nwith state officials; and (3) whether the state has so far insinuated itself into a\nposition of interdependence with the acting party that it must be recognized as a\njoint participant in the challenged activity.\u201d Kach v. Hose, 589 F.3d 626, 646 (3d\nCir. 2009) (internal quotations and alteration omitted). For state action to be\nfound, \u201cthe government must be \u2018responsible for the specific conduct of which the\nplaintiff complains.\u2019\u201d Borrell v. Bloomsburg Univ., 870 F.3d 154, 160 (3d Cir.\n2017) (quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982)). \u201cAction taken by\nprivate entities with the mere approval or acquiescence of the State is not state\naction.\u201d Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 52 (1999).\n\nThe allegations in the Complaint fall well short of satisfying any of these\ntests. The general rule is that a complaint may not be amended through an\nopposition brief and new facts may not be considered by a court ruling on a motion\nto dismiss. See Pennsylvania ex rel. Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d 173,\n\n181 (3d Cir. 1988) (citing Car Carriers, Inc. vy. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101,\n1107 (7th Cir. 1984)) ([I]t is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by\nthe briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.\u201d). Here, even were the Court to\nconsider Plaintiffs new allegations, asserted in response to the motion to dismiss,\nthey would not save his claims. As noted, Plaintiff concedes that he was not\nmandated to receive treatment at Gaudenzia, or anywhere else, as part of a\nsentencing order. Cf Jones v. Eagleville Hosp. & Rehab. Ctr., 588 F. Supp. 53,\n56 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (finding state action where a parole board mandated a stay in a\nrehabilitation center, and the parole board informed the plaintiff that \u201che would be\nunder the supervision, jurisdiction and authority of the employees, staff members\nand counselors... of [the rehabilitation program] and that any disobedience of the\nsame would result in the immediate revocation of his parole.\u201d). Regardless,\ncourts have regularly concluded that private actors such as rehabilitation centers,\nhalfway houses, and their employees were not acting under color of state law, even\n\nwhen the plaintiffs stay was ordered by a court or parole board.\u2019 Based on the\n\n2 See, e.g., Daniels v. Nw. Hum. Servs., 2021 WL 4166285, at *2 (3d Cir. Sept. 14,\n2021) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal where the plaintiff alleged only that\nresidential rehabilitation center was \u201cintegrated working with the City of\nPhiladelphia and its prison institutions and the state as well,\u201d and \u201c[p]eople from\nthe state jails are often sent to these [residential centers] for programs\u201d);\nConcepcion v. Kinch, 2022 WL 103351, at *1, 3 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 11, 2022)\n(concluding that the employees of a halfway house where the plaintiff resided in\nconnection with the terms of his sentence of probation were not state actors,\ndespite allegations that the plaintiff was mandated to reside at the halfway house,\nand \u201cif he had been kicked out, . . . he would be sent back to jail\u2019); Smith v.\nAlternative Counseling Servs., 2021 WL 492513, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 10, 2021)\n\n6\n\nfacts alleged, it is clear that Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendants acted under\ncolor of state law.\n\nAccordingly, because Plaintiff has failed to allege state action, his \u00a7 1983\nclaims must be dismissed. Dismissal is without prejudice. The Court will\npermit Plaintiff to amend his complaint, although it appears unlikely that the\ndeficiencies outlined herein can be remedied.\u2019\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019\n\nmotion to dismiss (D.I. 31); (2) deny Plaintiffs request for counsel (D.I. 19);* (3)\n\n(\u201cBased on the allegations of the Complaint, it appears that these Defendants\u2014a\nprivately run halfway house, its owner, and its employees\u2014~are not subject to\nliability under \u00a7 1983.\u201d); Veeder y. TRI-CAP, 2020 WL 1867212, at *5 (E.D.\nMich. Jan. 30, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 967481\n(E.D. Mich. Feb. 28, 2020) (\u201c\u2018[C]ourts have consistently held that drug treatment\nfacilities that treat individuals pursuant to a condition of parole are not performing\na public function.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Porter v. Game, 2020 WL 127580, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.\nJan. 9, 2020); see also Vaughn v. Phoenix House Programs of N.Y., 2015 WL\n5671902 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2015) (collecting cases and finding no state action\nwhen the plaintiff agreed to enter the in-patient treatment program as an alternative\nto incarceration because the state did not direct his treatment, the program was not\na public function, and the program had no role in the criminal proceedings).\n\n3 As noted, in his motion for supplemental jurisdiction, Plaintiff requested that this\nCourt exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any related state law claims. Should\nPlaintiff choose to file an amended complaint re-asserting his \u00a71983 claims, he\nmay assert any additional state-law claims therein.\n\n4 A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or statutory\nright to representation by counsel. See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192\n(3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 3d Cir. 1993). Given both\nPlaintiffs demonstrated competence in presenting his case thus far, and the low\n\n7\ndeny Plaintiff's motion for default judgment (D.I. 29); (4) deny Plaintiff's motion\nfor last known or present address of unserved defendant (D.I. 34); (5) deny\nPlaintiff's motion for continuance (D.I. 35); and (6) deny Plaintiffs motion for\nsupplemental jurisdiction (D.I. 37). Plaintiff will be given leave to file an\namended complaint.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n\nlikelihood of curing the identified deficiencies in light of the facts alleged,\nPlaintiffs request for counsel is denied. See Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155-57.\n\n8\nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nKEVIN L. HINES, )\nPlaintiff,\nv. Civ.
