D.I. 175.1 The Motion has been \nfully briefed. D.I. 176, 189, 191. The Court held oral argument on November 15, 2022. For the \nreasons set forth below, the Motion is granted-in-part and denied-in-part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn these coordinated actions, Jazz alleges infringement of seven patents. Near the outset \nof litigation, on August 25, 2021, Jazz served Interrogatory No. 8 seeking \"the complete factual \nand legal bases for Avadel's contention that [each] claim is allegedly invalid under 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7112.\" D.I. 176-1, Ex. A at 4; D.I. 44. Avadel responded on September 24, 2021, D.I. 52, and \nMarch 16, 2022, D.I. 86. \nOn November 29, 2021, the Court ordered the three above-captioned actions to proceed on \nthe same schedule. D.I. 65. The Court further ordered the parties to \"serve their final contentions \n(i.e., final infringement and invalidity contentions , as well as final non-infringement and validity \ncontentions) at least three weeks before Plaintiff serves its opening claim construction brief ... \nFinal contentions shall include a party's contentions under its proposed construction(s) , as well as \nunder the opposing construction(s ) (if such an alternative contention exists).\" Id. The Court then \nentered a stipulated order that required the parties to serve their respective infringement and \ninvalidity contentions by April 29, 2022, D.I. 72, a deadline later amended to May 6, 2022, D.I. \n97. Avadel served its Final Invalidity Contentions on May 6, 2022. D.I. 104. Jazz served its \nopening claim construction brief on May 27, 2022, D.I. 111, and the parties submitted their Joint \nClaim Construction Brief to the Court on July 29, 2022. D.I. 132. \n1 Docket numbers identified herein refer to C.A. No. 21-691-GBW unless otherwise noted. \n2 On September 1, 2022, approximately four months after the deadline for final invalidity \ncontentions , after claim construction briefing closed, but nearly two months before the close of \nfact discovery, Avadel served the Interrogatory Response. D.I. 176-1, Ex. A; D.I. 160. Jazz moved \nto strike Avadel's Interrogatory Response on September 20, 2022, D.I. 175, contending that \nAvadel's second supplementation \"adds many new substantive arguments that could and should \nhave been included in its final contentions .\" D.I. 176. While Jazz's Motion remained pending, \nfact discovery closed on October 21, 2022. D.I. 72. On November 28, 2022, the Court entered a \nstipulated Order extending certain deadlines related to expert discovery because \"the parties are \nstill working towards completing fact depositions in these cases.\" D.I. 240. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nThe parties disagree on the applicable legal standard. Jazz argues that, because A vadel \npurportedly seeks to introduce new invalidity theories in violation of the Scheduling Order (D.I. \n31) and its operative amendments (D.I. 65, 72, 97), Avadel must show good cause under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 16. D.I. 176. Avadel responds that a motion to strike is evaluated under \nthe Pennypack factors pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37. D.I. 189. \nCourts in this district have applied both Rule 16 and the Pennypack factors in analogous \nsituations involving belatedly-raised theories that should have been disclosed by a specific \ndeadline in a scheduling order. See In re ChanBond, LLC Pat. Litig., C.A. No. 15-842-RGA, 2019 \nWL 2098316, at *2 (D. Del. May 14, 2019) (applying good cause andPennypackwhen considering \nwhether to permit new invalidity combination raised in reply expert report when scheduling order \nrequired parties to reduce number of invalidity combinations by a certain date); St. Clair \nIntellectual Property Consultants, Inc. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., C.A. Nos. 04--1436-\nLPS, 06-404--LPS , 08-371-LPS , 2012 WL 1015993, at *5-7 (D. Del. Mar. 26, 2012), aff'd, 522 \n3 F. App'x 915 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (applying good cause and Pennypack when evaluating motion to \nsupplement expert reports adding infringement theories when scheduling order set forth deadline \nfor serving infringement contentions).2 Thus, this Court will apply both standards here. \nID. DISCUSSION \nJazz argues that Avadel lacked good cause to raise new invalidity theories after final \ncontentions were due and that Avadel's belated disclosure prejudiced Jazz. D.I. 176 & 191. \nA vadel avers that its Interrogatory Response raised no new theories and, in any event, Jazz has \nincurred no prejudice. D.I. 189. \nA. Avadel's Interrogatory Response Asserts a New Non-Enablement Theory \nAgainst the '079 and '782 Patents Based on Resinate Forms of GHB \nWhile Jazz argues that Avadel's Interrogatory Response raises three \"new contentions \", \nD.I. 176 at 2, Avadel explains that its Interrogatory Response merely contains \"elaborations \" of \ninvalidity theories previously disclosed . D .I. 189 at 1. The Court agrees with A vadel on the first \ntwo issues, and with Jazz on the third. \n2 While this Court issued a deadline for the parties to exchange final contentions (D.I. 65) \nneither that Order, the parties' Scheduling Order (D.I. 31), nor subsequent amendments thereto \n(D.I. 72, 97) established a good cause requirement governing modifications of the final contentions \ndeadline. Under these unique circumstances , the parties' cited authority is not on all fours. While \nthe court in First Quality Tissue, LLC v. Irving Consumer Prods., C.A. No. 19-428, D.I. 149 (D. \nDel. Oct. 27, 2020) and Takeda Pharms. US.A., Inc. v. West-Ward Pharm. Corp., C.A. No. 14-\n1268, 2018 WL 3369215 (D. Del. July 10, 2018) applied solely the Pennypackfactors to a motion \nto strike, the operative schedule in First Quality \"did not set a deadline for final invalidity \ncontentions\" and Takeda involved a supplemental interrogatory response raising a damages claim, \nnot contentions. While the court in Brit. Telecommunications PLC v. IAC/InterActiveCorp , C.A. \nNo. 18-366-WCB , 2020 WL 3047989 (D. Del. June 8, 2020) evaluated a motion to amend \ninvalidity contentions solely under good cause, good cause was specifically adopted by the court \nin that action. Id. at *1 (warning defendant it \"would permit [defendant] to amend its contentions \nand exceed those limits upon a showing of good cause\"). Similarly , the court in Fraunhofer\u00ad\nGesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Angewandten Forschung e. V v. Sirus XM Radio Inc., C.A. No. \n17-184-JFB-SRF, 2022 WL 608143 (D. Del. Jan. 27, 2022) used only good cause to evaluate a \nmotion for leave to amend invalidity contentions when a case-narrowing Order established \nrelevant deadlines modifiable only upon a showing of good cause. D.I. 427 ,r 15, 17-184-JFB\u00ad\nSRF. \n4 First, Jazz seeks to strike Avadel's assertions related to a \"new\" enablement defense arising \nfrom Jazz's construction of \"sustained release,\" arguing that Avadel \"now contends for the first \ntime in its Interrogatory Response that, '[i]f Jazz prevails on its construction of sustained release,' \nthe specifications fail to enable the full scope of the claims of the Sustained Release3 patents.\" D.I. \n176 at 2. Avadel's Interrogatory Response states, \"The specification does not provide sufficient \ninformation to enable a skilled artisan to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention , \nespecially under Jazz's construction of \"sustained release\" ... \"). D.I. 176-1, Ex. A at 15. This \nnon-enablement theory is rooted in Avadel's Final Invalidity Contentions where Avadel cites the \nfailure of ''the specification [to] provide a POSA with any guidance how one would achieve the \nclaimed GHB release profiles across the entire range of formulations claimed by the Jazz Sustained \nRelease Patents\" and explained that \"[i]n view of the breadth of the functional claims of the Jazz \nSustained Release Patents, the unpredictability in the art, and the limited disclosures in the \nspecification , a POSA would not believe the inventors were in possession of the full range of \npossible formulations that met the recited drug release profile.\" D.I. 189-1, Ex. A at 112. Thus, \nAvadel's contentions broadly suggest the claims of the Sustained Release Patents are not enabled \nunder any construction , which would include Jazz's proposed construction of \"sustained release.\" \nWhile Jazz complains that A vadel raised non-enablement \"in general terms and divorced from the \ncontext of any proposed claim construction ,\" D.I. 191 at 1, the Court cannot conclude that Avadel's \nsupplemental interrogatory response contains a new theory. Rather, Avadel's Interrogatory \nResponse elaborates on the position it previously disclosed. Thus, the Court denies Jazz's motion \n3 Because the parties previousl y agreed to refer to U.S. Patent Nos. 10,758,488 (\"the '488 \npatent\"), 10,813,885 (\"the '885 patent\"), 10,959,956 (\"the '956 patent\"), 10,966,931 (\"the '931 \npatent\") as the \"Sustained Release Patents,\" D.I. 132 at xii, the Court uses that language here. \n5 to strike portions of Avadel's Interrogatory Response discussing Avadel's enablement defense as \nto the Sustained Release Patents. \nSecond, Jazz seeks to strike Avadel's assertions related to a \"new\" written description \ndefense, arguing A vadel inappropriatel y relies \"on Jazz documents produced in October 2021\" to \ninvalidate the '079 patent.4 D.I. 176 at 2. In its Interrogatory Response , Avadel states,  \n \n \nD.I. 176-1, Ex. A at 45. This argument finds \nsupport in Avadel's Final Invalidity Contentions , which also questioned whether the inventors \npossessed a formulation permitting once-dail y dosing: \"a POSA would not have believed that the \ninventors were in possession of any controlled release component that could be administered as a \nsingle daily dose absent some disclosure of a means of achieving once-nightly dosing or data \ndemonstrating the inventors had achieved once-dail y dosing with a particular controlled release \ncomponent. \" D.I. 189-1, Ex. A at 244; see also id. (\"Given the foregoing, a POSA would need \ndata to believe that the inventors were in possession of a controlled release portion that would \npermit single daily dosing.\"). While Jazz maintains that Avadel's contention is \"much different\" \nthan A vadel' s Interrogatory Response , both speak to whether the inventors possessed or developed \na formulation that would allow once-nightly dosing. Thus, the Court denies Jazz's motion to strike \nportions of A vadel' s Interrogatory Response discussing A vadel' s written description defense as to \nthe '079 patent. \nThird, Jazz seeks to strike Avadel's assertions related to \"new enablement arguments \nagainst the '079 and '782 patents5\" that \"rely[] upon Jazz's documents produced in October 2021.\" \n4 \"'079 Patent\" refers to U.S. Patent No. 11,077,079. \n5 \"'782 Patent\" refers to U.S. Patent No. 11,147,782. \n6 \nD.I. 176 at 2. When companng Avadel's Interrogatory Response with its Final Invalidity \nContentions, A vadel' s basis for this enablement defense changed. A vadel' s Interrogatory \nResponse argues for lack of enablement based on resinate forms, explaining that, \"The '079 patent \nfails to enable the claimed method because resinate forms of GHB are inoperable,\" D.I. 176-1, Ex. \nA at 53; see also id. at 73 (\"The '782 patent fails to enable the full scope of the claimed invention \nbecause resinate forms are inoperable. \"). However , in its Final Invalidity Contentions, A vadel \nargued lack of enablement based on \"not GHB-resinate forms.\"6 See D.I. 189-1, Ex. A at 238-39; \n264 ( contending the '079 and '782 patents fail for lack of enablement because \"the specification 's \ndisclosure of [a controlled release component in the '079 patent and modified release particles in \nthe '782 patent] is limited to GHB-resinate forms ... It would require undue experimentation to \nmake and use controlled release components that are not GHB-resinate forms, \n \n Thus, Avadel's Interrogatory \nResponse raises a new basis for its non-enablement theory. \nA vadel argues that its Final Invalidity Contentions put Jazz on notice that A vadel would \nrely on Jazz's documents to prove non-enablement and, as a result, Avadel's use of those \ndocuments in its Interrogatory Response was not a surprise. Tr. 11:15-25; see also D.I. 189-1 at \n264 (arguing lack of enablement  \n \nEven so, those statements do not excuse A vadel from changing the basis of its \nnon-enablement theory from non-resinate forms to resinate forms via an Interrogatory Response \nserved after final contentions were due. \n6 Avadel's letter opposing Jazz's motion to strike does not dispute that its contentions are \ndirected to \"not GBH-resinate forms.\" D.I. 189 at 2. \n7 \nThus, the Court finds that A vadel' s Interrogatory Response contains a new theory of non\u00ad\nenablement against the '079 and '782 patents based on resinate forms of GBH-a theory not rooted \nin Avadel's Final Invalidity Contentions. Accordingl y, the Court turns to Rule 16 and the \nPennypack factors. \nB. Avadel Lacked Good Cause Under Rule 16 to Raise New Non-Enablement \nTheory After the Deadline for Final Invalidity Contentions \nUnder Rule 16(b)(4), \"A schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the \njudge's consent.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). \"Good cause is present when the schedule cannot be \nmet despite the moving party's diligence. \" Meda Pharm. Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., C.A. No. \n15-785-LPS , 2016 WL 6693113, at *1 (D. Del. Nov. 14, 2016). \nAvadel argues that Jazz \"invited\" the supplementation about which it now complains. D.I. \n189. But Jazz served Interrogatory No. 8 on August 25, 2021, near the outset of this litigation. \nWhile A vadel had an obligation to supplement its response consistent with its general discovery \nobligations under the Federal Rules (see, e.g., Rule 26(e)), Avadel does not argue that Jazz \nspecifically invited supplementation after the May 6, 2022 deadline for final contentions. And \neven if Avadel had an obligation to supplement , \"parties may not use their obligation to supplement \nas an excuse to violate the clear terms of a Scheduling Order, unilaterally buying themselves \nadditional time to make disclosures , thereby unduly prejudicing other parties and potentiall y \ndelaying the progress of a case.\" Abbott Lab ys v. Lupin Ltd, C.A. No. 09-152-LPS , 2011 WL \n1897322, at *3 (D. Del. May 19, 2011). Thus, Avadel's obligation to supplement its interrogatory \nresponse does not amount to good cause. \nA vadel also argues that , because Jazz's claim construction briefing was submitted after the \nMay 6 due date for final contentions , \"[s]tatements from that briefing constitute a subsequent event \nthat Courts recognize as good cause for a party to rely on.\" D.I. 189 at 2 (citing Amgen Inc. v. \n8 Kashiv Biosciences , LLC, C.A. No. 18-3347, 2019 WL 5445974, at *2 (D.N.J. Oct. 24, 2019)). \nBut here, the Court specifically contemplated the circumstances of which A vadel complains-that \nis, the parties were ordered to serve final contentions \"at least three weeks before Plaintiff serves \nits opening claim construction brief.\" D.I. 65. Thus, Avadel was on notice that it must serve its \nfinal contentions before receiving Jazz's opening claim construction brief. \nA vadel advances no other arguments to demonstrate it acted with the requisite diligence in \nraising its new non-enablement theory. cf ChanBond, 2019 WL 2098316, at *2 (finding good \ncause satisfied where defendant raised combination at issue \"at the first available opportunity \"). \nAlso, Avadel's delay in raising this theory six months after receiving all predicate documents from \nJazz, and four months after the deadline for final contentions is suspect.7 See, e.g., BioDelivery \nSci. Int'l. v. Chemo Res., SL., C.A. No. 19-444, D.I. 183 at 5 (D. Del. Feb. 20, 2020) (collecting \ncases noting that absent mitigating circumstances , three-, four-and five-month delays may amount \nto lack of diligence). \nAs a result, the Court will turn to whether A vadel' s untimely disclosure should be excluded \nunder Pennypack. See St. Clair, 2012 WL 1015993, at *7 (considering Pennypack even after \nfinding no good cause); BioDelivery Sci. Int'!., Inc. v. Alvogen PB Research & Development LLC, \nC.A. No. 18-1395, D.I. 143 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2020) (considering Pennypack after concluding \ninvalidity contentions supplementation was not timely and operative scheduling order did not \ncontain good cause requirement). \n7 A vadel does not dispute that it was in possession of the documents upon which it relied \nby March 2022 at the latest-before claim construction briefing, before final contentions were due \nin May 2022, and six months before it served its Interrogatory Response. D.I. 176 at 2, 3 n.4. \n9 C. The Pennypack Factors Do Not Support Exclusion \nRule 3 7 ( c )( 1) provides, \"If a party fails to provide information . . . as required by Rule \n26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information ... to supply evidence on a motion, at \na hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantiall y justified or is harmless. \" To determine \nwhether a failure to disclose was harmless , courts in the Third Circuit consider the Pennypack \nfactors: (1) the prejudice or surprise to the party against whom the evidence is offered; (2) the \npossibility of curing the prejudice; (3) the potential disruption of an orderly and efficient trial; ( 4) \nthe presence of bad faith or willfulness in failing to disclose the evidence ; and (5) the importance \nof the information withheld. Konstantopoulos v. Westvaco Corp., 112 F.3d 710, 719 (3d Cir. 1997) \n(citing Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home Ownership Ass 'n, 559 F.2d 894, 904-05 (3d Cir. 1977)). \n\"[T]he exclusion of critical evidence is an 'extreme' sanction, not normally to be imposed absent \na showing of willful deception or 'flagrant disregard ' of a court order by the proponent of the \nevidence.\" Id. The determination of whether to exclude evidence is within the discretion of the \ndistrict court. Id. \nThe first and second Pennypack factors (\"the prejudice or surprise to the party against \nwhom the evidence is offered\" and \"the possibility of curing the prejudice\") do not weigh in favor \nof exclusion. Jazz claims prejudice by arguing that Avadel's belated supplementation was not \nfair.8 See D.I. 191 at 2; Tr. 7:11-16 (\"If you have an order in place that requires contentions to be \nlooked [sic] in as of a certain date, it's not fair for a party to refuse to amend those contentions , try \nto introduce new theories through a separate discovery vehicle and then say gotcha; you have to \n8 For example, Jazz argues that Avadel \"deprived Jazz of the ability to adjust its claim \nconstruction positions based on the contentions ,\" D.I. 176 at 3, but does not explain any \nadjustments it would have purportedly made. Nor did Jazz raise any such adjustments during the \nCourt's October 25, 2022 claim construction hearing. \n10 move under Pennypack.\"). But unfairness alone does not rise to prejudice favoring exclusion. See \nChanBond, 2019 WL 2098316, at *3 (explaining that movant's mere identification of \n\"fundamental unfair[ness]\" as prejudice weighed against exclusion). While Jazz contends that the \nScheduling Order does not afford Jazz enough time to address Avadel's Interrogatory Response , \nincluding by obtaining discovery from third-parties , serving additional written discovery, and \npreparing for fact depositions, D .I. 176 at 3; D .I. 191 at 2, A vadel served its Interrogatory Response \nnearly two months before the close of fact discovery , and any lingering prejudice could be cured \nby a modest extension of the fact discovery deadline in the Scheduling Order. cf WebXchange Inc. \nv. FedEx Corp., C.A. No. 08-133-JJF , 2010 WL 299240, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 20, 2010) (\"In this \ncase discovery has not yet closed and there is substantial time for investigation, eliminating \nprejudice.\"). Indeed, while fact discovery closed while Jazz's Motion remained pending, the \nparties signaled that, at least as of November 28, 2022, \"the parties are still working towards \ncompleting fact depositions.\" D.I. 240. Also, opening, responsive, and reply expert reports are \nnot due until January 17, 2023, March 17, 2023, and May 15, 2023, respectively . D.I. 240. \nThe third Pennypack factor (''the potential disruption of an orderly and efficient trial\") \nweighs against exclusion as trial is scheduled for October 30, 2023-approximately eleven months \naway. \nThe fourth Pennypack factor (''the presence of bad faith or willfulness in failing to disclose \nthe evidence\"), is, on balance, neutral. While A vadel' s Interrogatory Response bypassed the final \ncontentions deadline, Jazz does not adduce any evidence to suggest that Avadel acted in bad faith. \nAlso, A vadel' s Interrogatory Response was served two months before fact discovery closed. See \nKonstantopoulos, 112 F.3d at 719 (\"[T]he exclusion of critical evidence is an 'extreme' sanction, \n11 not normally to be imposed absent a showing of willful deception or 'flagrant disregard' of a court \norder by the proponent of the evidence.\"). \nThe fifth Pennypack factor (\"the importance of the information withheld\") weighs against \nexclusion. A vadel has indicated that its enablement and written description invalidity positions \nare critical to its case. D.I. 189 at 5. See EMC Corp. v. Pure Storage, Inc., 154 F. Supp. 3d 81, 93 \n(D. Del. 2016) (\"Courts in the Third Circuit favor resolution of disputes on their merits, particularl y \nwith respect to patent validity issues, which raise public interest concerns extending beyond the \nimmediate dispute between the parties.\"). \nTherefore, on balance, the Pennypack factors do not support striking Avadel's \nInterrogatory Response. Any prejudice to Jazz can be cured with modest extensions to deadlines \nin the Scheduling Order. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Motion is GRANTED-IN-PART AND DENIED-IN\u00ad\nPART. \n* * * \n12 WHEREF ORE, this 8th day of December , 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.
