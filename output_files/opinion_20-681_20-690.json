Williams", "date": "12-19-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCAO LIGHTING, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nGENERAL ELECTRJC COMP ANY, \nCONSUMER LIGHTING (U.S.), LLC \nd/b/a GE LIGHTING, and CURRENT \nLIGHTING SOLUTIONS, LLC, \nDefendants. \nCAO LIGHTING, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nOSRAM SYL Y ANIA, INC., and \nLEDY ANCE LLC, \nDefendants. C.A. No. 20-681-GBW\nC.A. No. 20-690-GBW\nUNSEALED ON 12/19/22 \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff CAO Lighting, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\" or \"CAO\") initiated patent infringement lawsuits \nagainst Defendants General Electric Company, Consumer Lighting (U.S.), LLC d/b/a/ GE \nLighting, Current Lighting Solutions, LLC, Osram Sylvania, Inc. and LEDY ANCE, LLC ( collectively, the \"Defendants\").1 Plaintiff alleges that Defendants infringe U.S. Patent No. \n6,465,961 (\"the '961 patent\"). The '961 patent discloses the use of semiconductor light sources \nincorporating a semiconductor chip to provide visible light for general illumination of indoor and \noutdoor spaces used by humans. D.I. 246-1 at 1:6-12.2 \nPending before the Court are Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on, inter alia, no \ninequitable conduct, D.I. 243; and Defendants ' motion for summary judgment on, inter alia, non\u00ad\ninfringement.3 D.I. 248. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies both motions. \nI. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). \"A genuine issue of material fact is one that could lead a reasonable jury to find in \nfavor of the nonmoving party.\" Bletz v. Corrie, 974 F.3d 306,308 (3d Cir. 2020)(citation omitted). \n\"The court must review the record as a whole, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nnonmoving party, and must not 'weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations. \"' Id. \n( citation omitted). The Court must enter summary judgment if the non-moving party \"fails to \nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [its] case, and on \n1 The Court writes for the benefit of the parties and assumes their familiarity with these \nactions. \n2 Docket numbers identified herein refer to C.A. No. 20-681 unless otherwise noted. \n3 The Court ordered the parties to rank the grounds for summary judgment raised in their \nmotions \"with the understanding that once the Court denies summary judgment as to any single \nground raised in Plaintiff's [or Defendants '] motion, the Court will not address any summary \njudgment grounds that were ranked after that ground.\" D.I. 330. Plaintiff ranked \"No Inequitable \nConduct for Failure to Present Clear and Convincing Evidence of Deceptive Intent\" first. D.I. 333. \nDefendants ranked ''Non-infringement ('first reflective layer' ... )\" first. D.I. 332. \n2 which [the non-moving] party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 \nU.S. 317,322 (1986); see also SodexoMAGIC , LLC v. Drexel Univ., 24 F.4th 183,204 (3d Cir. \n2022) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322). The Federal Circuit \"reviews a district court's grant of \nsummary judgment under the law of the regional circuit, here the Third Circuit.\" Acceleration Bay \nLLC v. 2K Sports, Inc., 15 F.4th 1069, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment of No Inequitable Conduct Is \nDenied. \nPlaintiff seeks summary judgment of no inequitable conduct arguing that Defendants failed \nto present clear and convincing evidence that anyone associated with the prosecution of the '961 \npatent withheld references with an intent to deceive. D .I. 244 at 7-10. Defendants argue a genuine \nissue of material fact exists on the inventors ' and his attorneys ' specific intent to deceive the United \nStates Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") both during the initial prosecution of the patent \napplication that matured into the '961 patent and during reexamination proceedings of the '961 \npatent. D.I. 286 at 4. As there are genuine issues of material fact and a reasonable factfinder could \nfind for Defendants , Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment of no inequitable conduct is denied. \n\"Inequitable conduct is an equitable defense to patent infringement that, if proved, bars \nenforcement of a patent.\" US. Water Servs., Inc. v. Novozymes AIS, 843 F.3d 1345, 1352 (Fed. \nCir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"A finding of inequitable conduct as to \nany single claim renders the entire patent unenforceable[.]\" Id. (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). To prevail on an inequitable conduct allegation, \"the accused infringer must \nprove that the patentee acted with the specific intent to deceive the [PTO].\" Therasense , Inc. v. \nBecton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2011). \"In a case involving \nnondisclosure of information, clear and convincing evidence must show that the applicant made a \n3 deliberate decision to withhold a known material reference.\" Id. (emphasis in original) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). While a court may infer intent from indirect and \ncircumstantial evidence, \"to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard, the specific intent \nto deceive must be the 'single most reasonable inference able to be drawn from the evidence.\"' Id. \n(quoting Star Sci., Inc. v. R.J Reynolds Tobacco Co., 537 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008)). That \nis, the evidence must be sufficient to \"require a finding of deceitful intent in light of all of the \ncircumstances.\" Id. (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nOn August 24, 2001, Dr. Densen Cao and patent attorney Daniel P. McCarthy filed a patent \napplication that matured to the '961 patent. D.I. 245 at 1; D.I. 287 at 1. On August 29, 2002, in a \nseparate patent application filed by Dr. Cao and Mr. McCarthy, the PTO issued an Office Action \nrejecting certain claims in view of U.S. Patent No. 6,220,722 (\"Begemann\") and an article entitled \n\"LED's move from indication to illumination\" by Bill Schweber (\"Schweber\"). Id. Dr. Cao and \nMr. McCarthy did not submit the Begemann and Schweber references to the PTO in connection \nwith the '961 patent application. Id. Plaintiff argues that there is no evidence that Dr. Cao was \naware of Begemann and Schweber during the prosecution of the '961 patent. D.I. 244 at 7; D.I. \n295 at 1. Plaintiff also argues that Mr. McCarthy 's \"mere knowledge of the Begemann and \nSchweber reference cannot establish intent to deceive.\" D.I. 244 at 8; D.I. 295 at 2. Plaintiff cites \nto Therasense which states \"proving that an applicant knew of a reference, should have known of \nits materiality, and decided not to submit it to the PTO does not prove specific intent.\" 649 F.3d \nat 1290. Defendants disagree that Dr. Cao was not aware ofBegemann and Schweber. D.I. 286 \nat 6. It was Mr. McCarthy's practice to provide his clients with copies of the office actions and \nthe cited prior art. D.I. 286 at 6-7; D.I. 291-1, Ex. 95 (McCarthy Dep.) at 58:14-59:20. Mr. \nMcCarthy testified that he did recall the Begemann reference, but he could not recall why he did \n4 not file a supplemental Information Disclosure Statement (\"IDS\") to inform the Examiner that the \nreference was cited in a co-pending patent application. D.I. 286 at 6-7; D.I. 291-1, Ex. 95 \n(McCarthy Dep.) at 173:17-176:16 , 191:9-25, 212:12-214:12. \nAt the summary judgment stage, the focus is whether Defendants have \"mustered sufficient \nevidence such that, at the trial stage, a factfinder could reasonably conclude that deceptive intent \nis the single most reasonable inference. \" Sysmex Corp. v. Beckman Coulter, Inc., No. 19-1642-\nJFB-CJB , 2022 WL 1503987, at *4 (D. Del. May 6, 2022), report and recommendation \nadopted, No. 19-1642-JFB-CJB , 2022 WL 1744573 (D. Del. May 31, 2022) (emphasis in \noriginal). Granting summary judgment on inequitable conduct \"is permissible, but uncommon ,\" \nin light of the \"inherently factual nature of the issue of intent.\" Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles \nMach. Works, 437 F.3d 1309, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2006). As \"[d]irect evidence of intent is rare, ... a \ncourt must often infer intent from the surrounding circumstances. \" Id. Defendants have mustered \nsufficient evidence that a factfinder could reasonabl y conclude that Dr. Cao and Mr. McCarth y \nintended to deceive the PTO by not submitting the Begemann and Schweber references during the \nprosecution of the '961 patent. \nThere are also genuine issues of material fact regarding the behavior of Dr. Cao and John \nGadd, Dr. Cao's patent attorney during the reexamination of the '961 patent, during the \nreexamination proceedings of the '961 patent. D.I. 286 at 7-10. Plaintiff argues that there is no \nevidence that Dr. Cao was aware of a reference entitled Wierer et al., High Power AIGalnN flip\u00ad\nchip light-emitting diodes, 78 APPL. PHYS. LETT. 2 (May 28, 2001) (\"Wierer\") , which was cited \nduring one of the reexamination proceedings of the '961 patent. D.I. 244 at 7; D.I. 245 ,r 23; D.I. \n246-1, Ex. 12 (Cao Dep.) at 76:13-79:24. Mr. Gadd similarly testified in a deposition from an \nearlier litigation that he was not familiar with the Wierer reference. D.I. 244 at 9-10; D.I. 246-1, \n5 Ex. 14 (Gadd Dep.) at 57:2-12, 76:15-77:6 , 78:22-23. Defendants respond that Mr. Gadd was \nunable to explain how he was unaware of the Wierer reference when it was cited in one of the \nreexaminations of the '961 patent. D.I. 286 at 9; D.I. 246-1, Ex. 14 (Gadd Dep.) at 62:18-66:19. \nThere is also evidence that Dr. Cao was at least aware of the Wierer reference. D.I. 286 at 9. Yet, \n\"Wierer was never disclosed to the PTO by Mr. Gadd or Dr. Cao in the ex parte reexamination, \ndespite Mr. Gadd previously citing prior art reference cited in other inter partes reexaminations in \nthe ex parte reexaminations. \" Id. Thus, Defendants have mustered sufficient evidence that a \nfactfinder could reasonably conclude that Dr. Cao and Mr. Gadd intended to deceive the PTO by \nnot submitting the Wierer reference to the Examiner during the reexamination of the '961 patent. \nFor the reasons set out above, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment \nof no inequitable conduct. \nB. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment of Non-Infringement Is Denied. \nDefendants seek summary judgment of non-infringement arguing that, because claims in \nthe '961 patent purportedly require two structures-that is, a \"a substrate on which epitaxial layers \nare grown\" ( claim 7)4 and \"a device as recited in claim 7 further comprising a first and a second \n4 Claim 7 recites: \nA device as recited in claim 1 wherein said chip includes \na substrate on which epitaxial layers are grown, \na buffer layer located on said substrate, said buffer layer serving to mitigate \ndifferences in material properties between said substrate and other epitaxial \nlayers, \na first cladding layer serving to confine electron movement within the chip, said \nfirst cladding layer being adjacent said buffer layer, \nan active layer, said active layer emitting light when electrons jump to a valance \nstate, \na second cladding layer, said second cladding layer positioned so that said active \nlayer lies between cladding layers, and \na contact layer on which an electron may be mounted for powering said chip. \n6 reflective layers\" ( claim 8)5-Plaintiff may not point to the same \"patterned sapphire substrate\" \nto satisfy both claimed structures . See, e.g., D.I. 298 at 11. According to Defendants , the term \n\"further comprising \" in claim 8 requires the substrate and the first reflective layer to be physically \nseparate. Compare D.I. 249 at 28, with D.I. 280 at 4. It does not. \nThe Court declines to construe \"further comprising \" as creating a negative limitation \nrequiring separate structures for the \"first reflective layer\" and \"substrate. \" At claim construction , \nthe parties did not dispute the meaning of \"further comprising\" and the Court did not construe it. \nBut Defendants , now arguing that the plain meaning of\"further comprising \" requires the substrate \nand first reflective layer to be separate structures, D.I. 298 at 12, import a limitation this Court \nalready rejected.6 When the Court construed the phrase \"a first and a second reflective layers ... \nserving to reflect light emitted by said active layer\" in claim 8 to mean that \"the first and second \nreflective layers are distinct from each other and reflect light emitted by the active layer,\" the Court \nrejected Defendants ' proposed construct ion that would have required the layers to be comprised \nof \"distinct layers of material.\" D.I. 230 at 13 (rejecting Defendants ' proposed construction of \n\"distinct layers of material that are intended to reflect more light emitted by said active layer than \nis absorbed by and transmitted through the layers of material.\"). Indeed, the claims do not recite \n5 Claim 8 recites: \nA device as recited in claim 7 further comprising a first and a second \nreflective layers, each of said first and second reflective layers being located \non opposite sides of said active layer, said reflective layers serving to reflect \nlight emitted by said active layer. \n6 See also ABB Automation Inc. v. Schlumberger Res. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 254 F. Supp. 2d \n479,481 (D. Del. 2002) (denying summary judgment of non-infringement where \"[d]efendan t's \nmotion is based on a claim construction not adopted by the court\"). \n7 any properties or materials for the substrate. 7 See Applied Med. Resources Corp. v. US Surgical \nCorp., 448 F.3d 1324, 1333 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (explaining that use of two terms in a claim merely \n\"requires that they connote different meanings, not that they necessarily refer to two different \nstructures\"). Defendants have not persuaded the Court to disturb its prior claim construction Order \nor to conclude as a matter of law that the patterned sapphire substrate cannot constitute a \"first \nreflective layer\". \nThus, the parties' dispute amounts to an issue for the finder of fact relating to the \napplication of the claims-that is, whether the patterned sapphire substrate counts only as \"a \nsubstrate on which epitaxial layers are grown\" or as both \"a substrate on which epitaxial layers are \ngrown\" and a \"first reflective layer.\" Integra LifeSciences Corp. v. HyperBranch Med. Tech., Inc., \nNo. CV 15-819-LPS-CJB, 2018 WL 1664971, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 6, 2018); accord PPG Indus. v. \nGuardian Indus. Corp., 156 F.3d 1351, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (\"[A]fter the court has defined the \nclaim with whatever specificity and precision is warranted by the language of the claim and the \nevidence bearing on the proper construction , the task of determining whether the construed claim \nreads on the accused product is for the finder of fact.\"). \nFor the above reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment of non-infringement is \ndenied. \n7 Although Defendants quote a patent examiner as stating that \"claim 8 requires that the \nsubstrate and the reflectors be separate structures, \" D.I. 249 at 29, a statement by the examiner \ncannot evidence a disclaimer or disavowal of claim scope as the patent owner never said it or \nagreed with it. See, e.g., 3M Innovative Props. Co. v. Tredegar Corp., 725 F.3d 1315, 1331-32 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012) (\"We are guided by legal principles dictating that we rest on the statements made \nby the patentee over conflicting statements by the examiner because it is the patentee's words that \ndefine the claim.\"). \n8 III. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on \nno inequitable conduct. The Court also denies Defendants ' motion for summary judgment on non\u00ad\ninfringement. Pursuant to D.I. 330, with the exception of Plaintiffs and Defendants ' cross\u00ad\nmotions for summary judgment related to actual notice under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 (see D.I. 244 at 14-\n16; D.I. 249 at 10-11), all remaining grounds for summary judgment identified in Plaintiff's and \nDefendants ' motions are also denied. 8 \n* * * \nWHEREFORE , at Wilmington this 17th day of November, 2022, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that: \n1. Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment and Motions to Exclude Under Daubert and \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 (D.I. 254 in C.A. No. 20-690, D.I. 243 in C.A. No. 20-\n681) is DENIED-IN-PART . \n2. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony \n(D.I. 259 in C.A. No. 20-690, D.I. 248 in C.A. No. 20-681) is DENIED-IN-PART . \n3. Plaintiff's Motions to Exclude Under Daubert and Federal Rule of Evidence 702 (D.I. \n254 in C.A. No. 20-690, D.I. 243 in C.A. No. 20-681) and Defendants ' Motion to \nPreclude Expert Testimony (D.I. 259 in C.A. No. 20-690, D.I. 248 in C.A. No. 20-681) \nremain under consideration by the Court. \n8 The Court wants the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the cross-motions for summary \njudgment related to actual notice under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. The Court will enter a separate order \ngoverning the scheduling of the supplemental briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment \nrelated to actual notice under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287 and will rule on that motion after receiving the \nrequested supplemental briefing. \n9 4. Because the Memorandum Order is filed under seal, the parties shall meet and confer \nand, no later than November 29, 2022, submit a joint proposed redacted version, \naccompanied by a supporting memorandum , detailing how, under applicable law, the \nCourt may approve any requested redactions. In the absence of a timely, compliant \nrequest, the Court will unseal the entire opinion. \nGREGORY 8. WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nIO "}
