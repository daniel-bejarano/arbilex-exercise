{"case_name": "Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network, LLC v. Hartford Fire Insurance Company", "case_number": "22-622", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "10-11-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nYANKEES ENTERTAINMENT AND SPORTS \nNETWORK, LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nHARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE COMP ANY, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM Civil Action No. 22-00622-RGA \nBefore me is Hartford's Rule 12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal \nJurisdiction or, in the Alternative, to Transfer to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nofNew York. (D.I. 10). I have fully considered the parties' briefings. (D.I. 11, 12, 15). \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis is an insurance coverage case. Plaintiff Yankees Entertainment and Sports \nNetwork LLC is insured under a Special Multi-Flex Policy (\"the Policy\") issued by Defendant \nHartford Fire Insurance Company for the period of August 29, 2019 through August 29, 2020. \n(D.I. 1-1, Ex. A at pp. 47-146). The case arises out of Hartford's denial ofYankees's claim for \ncoverage of business losses Yankees allegedly incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n(See generally D.I. 8). \nYankees is a \"regional sports television network\" chiefly focused on broadcasting games \nand team-related programs involving the New York Yankees, the Brooklyn Nets, the New York \nLiberty, and the New York City FC. (Id at 1-2). Although Yankees \"primarily serves New York \n\u00b7 City, New York, and the surrounding areas\" (id at 1), its viewership \"spans the United States\" \n1 (id at 8). Yankees's principal place of business is New York, but it is a Delaware LLC and all of \nits members are business entities formed under Delaware law. (Id at 5). Hartford has asserted \nthat complete diversity of citizenship exists (D.I. 1 at 2-3), but it cannot presently be determined \nwhether that assertion is correct (D.I. 18). \nHartford is a Connecticut corporation with its principal place of business in\u00ad\nunsurprisingly-Hartford, Connecticut. (D.I. 8 at 5). Hartford has both initiated and been \nsubject to actions in Delaware federal and state courts (see, e.g., D.I. 12 at 1-2 ( collecting \ncases)), and at least one such lawsuit brought against Hartford is a coverage dispute over \nCOVID-19-related business losses. (See id at 12). \nThe Policy was negotiated between Yankees's broker, whose business address is in \n, Tampa, Florida, and a Hartford underwriter located in Hartford, Connecticut. (See D.I. 1-1, Ex. 1 \nat p. 148). In brief, the Policy insures against losses to property located at seven \"Insured \nPremises,\" five of which are located in New York City, and two of which are located in \nConnecticut and Florida. (D.I. 11, Ex. A). Yankees alleges that Hartford has breached and \ncontinues to breach its obligations under the Policy by failing to cover losses Yankees incurred \n\"in nearly all aspects of its business\" as a result of the \"impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe resulting closure orders.\" (D.I. 8 at 31). According to Yankees, because the pandemic's \nimpacts ''were not limited to New York,\" but rather \"affected every city\" where the relevant \nsports teams play-and because Yankees broadcasts to numerous other jurisdictions throughout \nthe country-Yankees's covered business losses \"span the nation.\" (Id at 31-32). \n2 II. LEGAL STANDARD \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(2), a party may move to dismiss a case \nbased on the court's lack of personal jurisdiction over that party. When reviewing a motion to \ndismis_s pursuant to Rule 12(b )(2), \"the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal \njurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence and must do so by establishing with reasonable \nparticularity sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\" Turner v. Prince \nGeorge's County Public Schools, 694 F. App'x 64, 66 (3d Cir. 2017). \"[W]hen the court does \nnot hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff need only establish a prima \nfacie case of personal jurisdiction and the plaintiff is entitled to have its allegations taken as true \nand all factual disputes drawn in its favor.\" Miller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 (3d \nCir. 2004). A court is always free to revisit the issue of personal jurisdiction if it later is revealed \nthat the facts alleged in support of jurisdiction are in dispute. See Metcalfe v. Renaissance . \nMarine, Inc., 566 F.3d 324, 331 (3d Cir. 2009). \nIn the absence of consent, personal jurisdiction exists if two requirements are satisfied. \nFirst, there must be a statutory basis for jurisdiction pursuant to Delaware's long-arm statute. \nSee IMO Indus., Inc. v. Kiekert AG, 155 F.3d 254,259 (3d Cir. 1998). Second, the exercise of \njurisdiction over the defendant must comport with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \n' ' \nAmendment. Int'l Shoe Co. v. State o/Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 \nU.S. 310,315 (1945). Delaware's long-arm statute \"has been broadly construed to confer \njurisdiction to the maximum extent possible under the Due Process Clause.\" LaNuova D & B, \nS.p.A. v. Bowe Co., 513 A.2d 764, 768 (Del. 1986). However, the personal jurisdictional \n3 \n\\ analysis \"must not be collapsed into a single constitutional inquiry.\" Power Integrations, Inc. v. \nBCD Semiconductor Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 365,370 n. 3 (D. Del. 2008). \n-III. DISCUSSION \nA. Lack of Personal Jurisdiction \n1. Consent to Jurisdiction \nYankees argues that Hartford implicitly consented to the jurisdiction of this court by \nvirtue of its involvement in other Delaware litigation. (D.1. 12 at 11-12). Because the personal \njurisdiction requirement is based on individual liberty interests protected by the Due Process \nClause, it can, like other such rights, be waived by any legal arrangement that demonstrates a \nparty's expressed or implied consent to thatjurisdictiori. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702-04 (1982). Determining whether a \ncorporation consented to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of a particular state is a matter to \nbe determined by examination of the law of that state. Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. v. Mylan \nPharm. Inc., 78 F. Supp. 3d 572,584 (D. Del. 2015), ajf'd, 817 F.3d 755 (Fed. Cir. 2016). \nUnder Delaware law, a party can be considered to have consented to jurisdiction by \n\"instituting another, related suit\" that has \"some logical relationship\" to the present suit. Foster \nWheeler Energy Co. v. Metallgesellschaft AG, 1993 WL 669447, at *1, 4 (D. Del. Jan. 4, 1993). \nGenerally, Delaware courts have found that a logical relationship exists where there are parallel \nsuits between identical parties. See, e.g., id. at *4 ( defendant impliedly consented to jurisdiction \nin:Delaware after previously procuring a dismissal of same claim in parallel suit brought by \nplaintiff). Prior litigation lacking such a relationship has generally been insufficient to constitute \nimplied consent to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Funai Electric Co. v. Personalized Media \nCommunications, LLC, 2016 WL 370708, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 29, 2016) (no implied consent \n4 where defendant previously filed two earlier patent-infringement suits in Delaware against \nparties lacking \"logical relationship\" to parties in second suit). \nHere, there is no indication that any of Hartford's Delaware lawsuits that Yankees has \ncompiled bear a sufficiently close relationship to this case. Yankees' s reliance on one such \nlawsuit, The Band's Visit Nat'! Tour v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., No. N22C-03-048 (Del. Mar. 4, \n2022), is inapposite. That case, which was brought against Hartford by \"touring musical \nproductions\" seeking coverage for alleged COVID-19-related business losses, involved different \nplaintiffs and different underlying facts. For example, those plaintiffs held distinct specialized \ninsurance policies that are not at issue here (see D.I. 15 at 9), and Yankees has failed to establish \nthat there is any sort of relationship--let alone a logical relationship--between those plaintiffs \nap.d itself. \nYankees contends that Hartford's involvement in The Band's Visit should nevertheless \nconstitute consent because The Band's Visit involved \"these very types of claims\" (i.e., COVID-\n19 coverage issues). (D.I. 12 at 12). Yankees's only support for this theory is its effort to \ndistinguish Beaton v. LG Chem, Ltd., 2021 WL 3828835 (D.N.J. Aug. 26, 2021). There, the \ncourt held that a manufacturer had not consented to personal jurisdiction in a forum where it had \n' previously initiated litigation, in part because the prior litigation involved different issues-\npatent infringement claims rather than product liability claims. Id. at * 5. According to Yankees, \nB~aton supports the view that where the issues are the same, consent exists. (D.I. 12 at 11). \nThis argument fails for two reasons. First, I agree with Hartford that Beaton \"at most\" \nsuggests that \"a party that affirmatively seeks to litigate an issue in a state's courts waives future \njurisdictional challenges to lawsuits filed in the state that raise the same issue.\" (D.I. 15 at 8) \n5 (emphasis in original). Hartford, however, has not done that here. Unlike the manufacturer in \nBeaton, which had affirmatively sought to litigate the prior disputes in the forum, Hartford had \nn:o control over the forum in The Band's Visit. The complaint in that case had been filed against \nHartford. (Id). Second, the Beaton court cited an additional reason for its consent holding. The \nprior lawsuits at issue there involved different parties. Beaton, 2021 WL 3828835, at *5. Such \nis the case here as well. \nI therefore conclude that Hartford has not consented to the personal jurisdiction of this \ncourt. \n2. Specific Jurisdiction Pursuant to Delaware's Long-arm Statute \nYankees argues t_hat that the court may exercise specific jurisdiction over Hartford pursuant \nto \u00a7 3104(c)(l)1 of Delaware's long-arm statute, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c). (D.I. 12 at 5-6). The \nDelaware long-arm statute is \"broadly construed to confer jurisdiction to the maximum extent \npossible under the Due Process Clause.\" Hercules Inc. v. Leu Trust & Banking (Bahamas) Ltd, \n611 A.2d 476, 480-81 (Del. 1992). Delaware law, however, does not teach that the statutory and \nconstitutional steps should be collapsed into a single analysis. JCT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. \nBoehringer lngelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 147 F. Supp. 2d 268, 271 n.4 (D. Del. 2001). I \ntherefore examine the application of the long-arm statute and only turn to the constitutional \nanalysis should it be necessary. \nDelaware's long-arm statute provides as follows: \n1 In its answering brief, Yankees states that \u00a7 3104( c )( 6) provides an additional and \nindependent means for the court to exercise specific jurisdiction. (D.I. 12 at 6). Yankees does \nnot cite any authority for this proposition, nor does it offer any response to Hartford's arguments \nwith respect to that provision. Yankees centers its argument on\u00a7 3104(c)(l). Accordingly, so \ndo I. \n6 ( c) As to a cause of action brought by any person arising from any of the acts enumerated \nin this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident, or a \npersonal representative, who in person or through an agent: \n( 1) Transacts any business or performs any character of work or service in the State; \n(2) Contracts to supply services or things in this State; \n(3) Causes tortious injury in the State by an act or omission in this State; \n(4) Causes tortious injury in the State or outside of the State by an act or omission \noutside the State if the person regularly does or solicits business, engages in any \nother persistent course of conduct in the State or derives substantial revenue from \nservices, or things used or consumed in the State; \n(5).Has an interest in, uses or possesses real property in the State; or \n(6) Contracts to insure or act as surety for, or on, any person, property, risk, \ncontract, obligation or agreement located, executed or to be performed within the \nState at the time the contract is made, unless the parties otherwise provide in \nwriting. \n10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104( c ). The foregoing provisions are construed \"liberally so as to provide \njurisdiction to the maximum extent possible\" in order \"to provide residents a means of redress \nagainst those not subject to personal service within the State.\" Boone v. Oy PartekAb, 724 A.2d \n1150, 1156-57 (Del. Super. 1997). Sections 3104(c)(l-3), (5), and (6) have been interpreted as \nspecific jurisdiction provisions, while \u00a7 3104( c )( 4) confers general jurisdiction. Devicor \nMedical Products, Inc. v. Biopsy Sciences, LLC, 2013 WL 486638, *5 (D. Del. Feb. 7, 2013). \nUnder \u00a7 3104( c )(1 ), specific personal jurisdiction is proper over any nonresident who, in \nperson or through an agent, \"[t]ransacts any business\" in the State, so long as the claims in \nquestion \"aris[e] from\" that transaction of business. 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c)(l). The transaction \nneed not be continuous; \"even a single transaction is sufficient if the claim has its origin in the \nasserted transaction.\" Uribe v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, 2015 WL 3536574, at *4 (Del. May \n21, 2015) (internal citations omitted). \n7 Yankees contends that Hartford has transacted business in Delaware because Hartford has \n\"[sold] property insurance policies covering risks for Delaware companies formed under the laws \nof the state of Delaware,\" collected premiums from those insureds, voluntarily litigated other \ncases in Delaware, and denied coverage for the business losses that Yankees allegedly suffered \ndue to its inability to broadcast its programming nationwide, including to subscribers in \nDelaware. (See D.I. 12, 5-6). On all these theories, Yankees swings and misses. \nHartford's issuance of policies to third-party entities formed under Delaware law is not \n\"transact[ing] business\" under subsection ( c )(1 ). Simply \"doing business\" in a forum state is not \nenough to satisfy that prong. Cf Eaton v. Allstate Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 2021 WL 3662451, at \n*l (Del. Super. Apr. 28, 2021) (granting insurance company's motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction because selling other insurance policies in Delaware is insufficient to confer \ngeneral jurisdiction in Delaware); Rosado v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2020 WL 3887880, \nat *2 (Del. Super. July 9, 2020) (same). Because Yankees's cause of action does not \"aris[e] \nfrom\" contacts with unrelated third parties, this argument fails. \nSo does Yankees' s argument that Hartford transacted business in Delaware by \"voluntarily \nlitigating\" here. (D.I. 12 at 5). Filing an action in Delaware constitutes a business transaction \n. for the purposes of subsection (c)(l). Gouldv. Gould, 2011 WL 141168, at *8 (Del. Ch. Jan. 7, \n2011 ). Earlier filings fail the \"arising from\" requirement, however, when the parties and \nunderlying factual contexts involved are sufficiently different from and independent of those in \nthe action at issue. See Uribe, 2015 WL 3536574, at *4 (defendant's earlier filings in Delaware \nof several unrelated insurance suits does not meet subsection ( c )( 1) \"arising out of' \nrequirement); see also Sprint Nextel Corp. v. iPCS, Inc., 2008 WL 2737409, at *9 (Del. Ch. July \n8 14, 2008) (second action did not \"arise from\" earlier action, despite the fact that the earlier action \ninvolved the same contracts, provisions, and parties, because the earlier action involved distinct \nunderlying facts). Here, Yankees is not a party in any of the earlier actions that it has cited, and \nYankees has not showed that the facts in those cases relate to those in the case at bar. Indeed, the \nonly such case that Yankees discusses in its opposition brief is The Band's Visit, in which \nHartford was the defendant. (D.I. 12 at 12). As explained above in the context of consent to \njurisdiction, although that case involves a similar coverage dispute, Yankees has failed to \ndemonstrate any logical or causal relationship between that action and this one. Thus, Hartford's \nother litigation in Delaware does not satisfy subsection(c)(l). \nYankees' s final argument, that Hartford transacted business in Delaware by entering into the \nspecific insurance agreement at issue here, is unavailing. As I understand it, this argument has \nt\\yo components. First, Yankees suggests that its own status as a Delaware LLC renders the \nPolicy a business transaction \"in\" Delaware for the purposes of subsection (c)(l). (See D.I. 12 at \n5, 10). Delaware courts have rejected attempts to satisfy subsection (c)(l) based upon little more \nthan a contract partner's status as a Delaware company or resident. See, e.g., Zausner Foods \nCorp. v. ECB USA, Inc., 2022 WL 609110, at *8 (D. Del. Jan. 31, 2022); Fischer v. Hilton, 549 \nF. Supp. 389,391 (D. Del. 1982) (defendant did not \"transact business\" in Delaware by entering \na contract with a Delaware resident when that contract was, aside from two telephone calls, \nnegotiated and executed out-of-state). As the Fischer court explained, subsection (c)(l) \n9 \"requires some action by the defendant occurring in the State of Delaware.\" Id The bare fact \nthat Yankees is a Delaware LLC is therefore insufficient to satisfy subsection (c)(l).2 \nSecond, Yankees contends that the requisite actions that Hartford has taken \"in\" Delaware \nare established by the fact that Yankees's business losses-which it alleges the Policy covered\u00ad\n\"extend to the numerous jurisdictions where [ the Yankees, Nets, Liberty, and New York City \nFootball Club] play and where Yankees broadcasts, including Delaware.\" (D.I. 12 at 10). This \nargument proves too much. When taken to its logical conclusion, it would establish personal \njurisdiction over Hartford in any state from which Yankees derives revenue-and according to \nYankees, those states \"span the nation.\" (D.I. 12 at 16). I agree with Hartford that \"[Yankees] \ncannot rely on its own business activities ... to demonstrate that Hartford has transacted \nbusiness in Delaware.\" (D.I. 15 at 4); see Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 285-86 (2014). \nTo prove that Hartford has transacted business in Delaware, a plaintiff must point to some \nrelevant action that the defendant-not the plaintiff-has taken within the state of Delaware. \nYankees has not done so. \"[C]ontracting with or transacting business with a Delaware \ncorporation is insufficient to support personal jurisdiction, absent facts ... that, at a minimum, \n2 Yankees argues that it should be permitted to obtain limited jurisdictional discovery \"to \ndetermine the extent of Hartford's knowledge of Yankees's connections to Delaware, including \nany knowledge obtained during the underwriting process.\" (D.I. 12 at 10, n.5). The Supreme \nCourt has held that \"where issues arise as to jurisdiction or venue, discovery is available to \nascertain the facts bearing on such issues.\" Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, \n3~1 n.13 (1978). Unless a plaintiff's claim is \"clearly :frivolous,\" jurisdictional discovery should \nbe allowed. Toys \"R\" Us Inc. v. Step Two, S.A., 318 F.3d 446,456 (3d Cir. 2003). \nHere, no information obtained through the requested discovery would lead me to deny \nHartford's motion. Even if Yankees could establish these facts, they would be irrelevant to the \nsubsection (c)(l) analysis. Because Yankees's status as a Delaware LLC is, for the reasons \nexplained above, unrelated to Yankees's claims in this case, Hartford's knowledge of that fact is \nimmaterial. Thus, I will deny Yankees' s request for jurisdictional discovery. \n10 establish that the performance of the contract/transaction took place in Delaware.\" Zausner \nFoods, 2022 WL 609110, at *9. Here, the Policy at issue was negotiated and executed out-of\u00ad\nstate (D.1. 1-1, Ex. 1 at pp. 148), the coverage it provides is tied to premises located outside of \nDelaware (D.I. 1-1, D.I. 11, Ex. A), and the Policy does not specify any other locations from \nwhich Yankees derives revenue. Yankees has not argued that any other meaningful connections \nbetween the P~licy and the state of Delaware exist. 3 Thus, I conclude that Yankees has not \nestablished that Hartford has \"transacted business\" in this state within the meaning of\u00a7 \n3104(c)(l). \nIn conclusion, Yankees has not demonstrated that its claims arise out of Hartford's \ntransaction of business in this state as required by Delaware's long-arm statute. Because this . ' \ncourt cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over Hartford pursuant to Delaware's long-arm \nstatute, I do not need to consider Hartford's constitutional right to due process. \nB. Transfer \nHaving found that this court lacks personal jurisdiction over Hartford does not, however, \nI \nerid the matter. Hartford has argued that, even if this court does exercise personal jurisdiction over \nHartford, the case should be transferred to the Southern District ofNew York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nI \n\u00a7 1404(a). (D.I. 10). Because I have found that personal jurisdiction over Hartford does not exist, \n3 Yankees also seeks jurisdictional discovery \"to determine Hartford's own connections to \nDblaware, such as real estate owned or leased in the State, employees and agents in the State, \nnon-premium income sources from Delaware, advertisements directed to Delaware, and traffic \non Hartford's website or apps originating from Delaware.\" (D.I. 12 at 12-13). \nMy decision would not change even if such connections existed. They would nevertheless \nfail to give rise to jurisdiction under subsection (c)(l), as they would lack the necessary nexus \nwith Yankees's claims. Thus, I will deny this request as well. \n11 however, venue is improper, and\u00a7 1404(a) is therefore inapplicable. The parties have not argued \ntransfer under other potentially applicable statutes, such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a), and have not \nattempted to make any showing that the interests of justice favor transfer as opposed to dismissal. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I conclude that Yankees has failed to demonstrate that \npersonal jurisdiction exists over Hartford, I deny Yankees's request for jurisdictional di~covery, \nand I dismiss Yankees's claims without prejudice. \nAn appropriate order will follow. \n12 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nYANKEES ENTERTAINMENT AND SPORTS \nNETWORK, LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nHARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE COMP ANY, \nDefendant.
