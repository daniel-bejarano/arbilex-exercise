BACKGROUND\n\nThis is a civil rights action arising from the alleged wrongful repossession of Plaintiff's\n2017 Dodge Durango. According to the First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d), on June 24, 2019,\nGas Recovery, LLC, (\u201cGas Recovery\u201d), acting on behalf of the financing entity, Santander\nConsumer USA Inc. d/b/a Chrysler Capital (\u201cChrysler\u201d), attempted to repossess Plaintiff's\nvehicle without first obtaining a court order. (No. 21-874-SRF, D.I. 31 at {J 15-16, 18) Plaintiff\navers he objected to the repossession peacefully, but Gas Recovery called the City of Dover\nPolice Department (\u201cDover Police\u201d) for assistance. (Jd. at {J 21-22) Officers Spicer and Weir\nand Corporal Hurd arrived at the scene, and one or more of them instructed Plaintiff to leave his\nvehicle. (Jd. at {] 22-24) When Plaintiff refused, he contends Defendants forcibly removed him\nfrom his vehicle, deployed tasers at least twice, arrested and charged him with various offenses.\n(Id. at \u00a5 24)\n\nPlaintiff filed two actions which were consolidated for discovery by Oral Order on\nSeptember 8, 2021. The first action is against the repossession company, Gas Recovery, and the\nfinancing entity, Chrysler.* (No. 20-840-SRF) The second action is against Dover Police\n\nOfficers Logan Spicer, Nathaniel Weir, and Scott Hurd. (No. 21-874-SRF) The FAC against the\n\n2 The briefing for the Conspiracy Motion is as follows: Defendants\u2019 opening brief (D.I. 86),\nPlaintiffs response brief (D.I. 89), and Defendants\u2019 reply brief (D.I. 92).\n\n3 The briefing for the Due Process Motion is as follows: Defendants\u2019 opening brief (D.I. 88),\nPlaintiff's response brief (D.I. 90), and Defendants\u2019 reply brief (D.I. 93).\n\n4 The case against Gas Recovery and Chrysler has settled. (D.I. 96)\n\n2\nmoving Defendants asserts claims for excessive force, (No. 21-874-SRF, D.I. 31 at 59), false\narrest, (Id. at { 60), false imprisonment, (Jd. at { 61), malicious prosecution, (/d. at J 62), aiding\nin a civil repossession without due process, (Jd. at { 57), conspiring to destroy video evidence,\n(Id. at | 41), and the failure to intervene, (/d. at \u00a7 63). The Motions for Partial Summary\nJudgment are directed only to the claims for conspiracy, due process violations for aiding in the\nrepossession, and wrongful arrest. (D.I. 85; D.I. 87)\n\nThere were three attempts to repossess the Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle wherein Gas Recovery\ncalled Dover Police despite its failure to obtain a court order for the repossession. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1\nat 37:16-18, 39:23-40:4; 51:23-24) The first two repossession attempts were unsuccessful. (Jd.\nat 38:5\u20147, 40:11-15) The third repossession attempt is the subject of this litigation.\n\nAt the time of the repossession, Plaintiff was living in the Durango, which he parked in\nthe Country Club Apartments in Dover, Delaware, where is friend, Sonia Addison, resided. (Id.\nat 32:2433:5; 35:2-8; 36:22-37:4; 39:18-20) The third repossession attempt occurred on June\n24, 2019, in the early morning hours, at approximately 1 a.m. (Jd. at 87:6-18) Plaintiff saw the\ntow truck operator preparing to tow his vehicle, so the Plaintiff entered the vehicle. (Jd. at 48:8\u2014\n49:22)\n\nAfter the tow truck operator had the front wheels hooked, the operator told Plaintiff that\nhe was going to call the police. (/d. at 49:23-24) Plaintiff responded that he had a right to\noppose the repossession, but the tow truck operator said, \u201cI have a special rapport with the police\nofficers on this shift\u201d and points to his back window, saying he has a camera. (/d. at 50:3-20)\nThe tow truck operator then lifted the front wheels of the vehicle with the tow equipment and\n\ncalled police. (/d. at 50:21-51:1) Plaintiff contends that out of concern for his safety in the\nvehicle and to alert his friend who lived in the apartment complex, Plaintiff honked his car horn.\n(Id. at 51:1-13)\n\nDefendants Spicer and Weir, both patrolmen for the City of Dover Police Department,\narrived at the scene and observed Plaintiff sitting in the Durango which was already attached to\nthe tow truck with its front wheels suspended. (D.I. 91, Ex. 4 at 73:8-74:23; D.I. 91, Ex. 5 at\n27:2-29:10)\n\nAccording to the Plaintiff, when the Officers arrived, they went over to the tow truck\noperator and had a \u201cconversation for several minutes.\u201d (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 52:10-20) Afterwards,\nthe Officers, individually, made various attempts to persuade Plaintiff to leave the Durango. (id.\nat 53:7-57:24) Plaintiff states that he was told he was not under arrest so he remained inside his\nDurango and asked for a Dover Police Department supervisor. (Jd. at 53:16-17; 55:11-13,\n55:21-56:8)\n\nPlaintiff contends that one of the Officers claimed that he would require the tow truck\noperator to release the vehicle if the Plaintiff showed him the vehicle\u2019s title. (Jd. at 57:21-24;\n58:22-59:1) Plaintiff presented the vehicle\u2019s registration and title and claims the Officers had\nanother \u201clengthy conversation\u201d with the tow truck operator. (Jd. at 58:1-59:6) Thereafter, both\nOfficers returned to Plaintiffs vehicle and attempted to force the window down and unlock the\ndoor. (/d. at 59:11-63:15) Plaintiff denies activating the vehicle\u2019s horn and claims it was\nDefendant Weir\u2019s elbow which activated it. (Jd. at 62:11-16; D.I. 91, Ex. 3 at ]5) Once the\ndoor was opened, one of the Officer\u2019s grabbed Plaintiffs arm and told him he was under arrest\nfor disturbing the peace. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 63:17-64:6)\n\nPlaintiff claims he was not resisting arrest, but nevertheless, the Officers beat him and\n\nused their taser on him twice before putting him in the police cruiser. (Jd. at 64:11-67:17; 72:3-\n74:20; 76:8-79:15) Plaintiff claims the beating occurred in the presence of the Officers\u2019\nsupervisor, Defendant Scott Hurd, and fellow Officer Mark Guiteras. (Id. at 74:21-75:24)\nPlaintiff claims he heard an individual say, \u201c[tJhat\u2019s enough. Let him up. Get off him,\u201d but could\nnot say whether it was Defendant Hurd or Guiteras. (/d. at 74:10-23)\n\nDefendant Spicer allegedly grabbed Plaintiff's keys out of the Durango and handed them\nto the tow truck operator who drove away with Plaintiff's vehicle. (/d. at 84:11-19) Following\nhis arrest, Plaintiff requested to go to the hospital for the pain in his ribs and difficulty breathing,\nso he was transported to Bayhealth Hospital. (/d. at 94:14-97:5)\n\nDefendants dispute Plaintiff's account of the incident. They claim that the Plaintiff was\nactively honking the horn and yelling after they arrived at the scene. (D.I. 91, Ex. 4 at 81:1-12;\nD.I. 91, Ex. 5 at 20:10-11) They also claim that the Plaintiff was combative with them, resisted\narrest and attempted to run as the Officers took him to the patrol vehicle. (D.I. 91, Ex. 4 at\n143:19-144:25, 145:22-24; D.I. 91, Ex. 5 at 22:1-23:2, 180:7-10)\n\nPlaintiff was criminally charged as a result of the incident, and his trial was set to begin\non September 22, 2021. (No. 21-874-SRF, D.I. 31 at ]7) Shawn Sweigart\u2019 (\u201cSweigart\u201d), an\nemployee of Gas Recovery, was the individual tow truck operator hired to repossess Plaintiff's\nvehicle and was expected to testify as the State\u2019s witness in the Plaintiff's criminal trial. (/d.)\nPlaintiff claims that Sweigart, in the presence of Plaintiffs counsel, the State Prosecutor, and\nother witnesses disclosed that a video was recorded from equipment in his tow truck and it\ncaptured the Dover Officers\u2019 use of force against the Plaintiff. (/d.) Sweigart allegedly\nrepresented that his employer, Gas Recovery, was instructed by Dover Police to destroy the\n5 The witness has been referred to by different names. Defendants assert the witness identified\nhimself to the Officers as \u201cCraig Jones\u201d on the night of the third repossession. (D.I. 86 at { 11)\n\nGas Recovery previously referred to him as \u201cCarl Walker.\u201d (D.I. 54, Ex. 4 at 75) Further\ninvestigation revealed his name is \u201cShawn Sweigart.\u201d (D.I. 86 at J 11)\n\n5\nvideo. (/d.) Plaintiff includes as an exhibit to his answering brief a link to a videorecording\nmade by his attorney outside the courthouse on the day of Plaintiffs criminal trial in which\nSweigart recounts the foregoing statements. (D.I. 91, Ex. 16; see also D.I. 91, Ex. 17) The\nprosecutor did not go forward with trial and the criminal charges against the Plaintiff pending in\nthe Court of Common Pleas for Kent County, Delaware, were dismissed nolle prosequi with\nprejudice. (No. 21-874-SRF, D.I. 31 at ff 45-46)\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Plaintiff initiated this suit against Officers Spicer, Weir, Hurd, and\nJohn Does 1-4. (No. 21-874, D.I. 1) The FAC was filed on March 7, 2022. (No. 21-874, D.I.\n31) Plaintiff attempted to subpoena Sweigart for a deposition regarding his recorded statements\nbut has been unsuccessful. (See D.I. 49; D.I. 66) In his deposition, Gas Recovery\u2019s principal,\nBrandon Mullins, refuted Sweigart\u2019s statements that the tow truck was equipped with video\nrecording equipment. (D.I. 86, Ex. D at 13:9-17) Mullins testified that the device on the tow\ntruck was a license plate reader. (/d. at 82:3-25)\n\nOn September 30, 2022, Defendants filed the present Motions for Partial Summary\nJudgment. (D.I. 85; D.I. 87) The Motions seek judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff\u2019s claim\nthat Defendants conspired to cover-up their wrongdoing; Plaintiff's claim of a due process\nviolation for improper police involvement in a civil repossession, and Plaintiff's claim for\nwrongful arrest without probable cause. (See e.g., No. 21-874-SRF, D.I. 31 at {] 6, 36, 57, 60\n64)\n\nlI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those that could affect the outcome of the proceeding, and \u201ca\ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury\nto return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.\n2011) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)); see Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).\n\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely disputed\nmaterial fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The burden then shifts to the non-movant to\ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial, and the court must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458,\n460-61 (3d Cir. 1989); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). An assertion of whether or not\na fact is genuinely disputed must be supported either by citing to \u201cparticular parts of materials in\nthe record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or\ndeclarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions,\ninterrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not\nestablish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce\nadmissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).\n\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdo more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586. The \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not\ndefeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment;\u201d rather, there must be\nenough evidence to enable a jury to reasonably find for the non-moving party on the issue. See\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49 (emphasis in original). \u201cIf the evidence is merely colorable, or is\n\nnot significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d Jd. at 249-50 (internal citations\nomitted); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. If the non-movant fails to make a sufficient showing\non an essential element of its case on which it bears the burden of proof, then the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden for Summary Judgment on the\nPlaintiff's Conspiracy Claim\n\nPlaintiff claims the Defendants conspired to cover-up their wrongdoing by directing the\ndestruction of video evidence captured from Sweigart\u2019s tow truck. (No. 21-874-SRF, D.I. 31 at\n{1 36, 41-42) Defendants assert summary judgment is appropriate because the Plaintiff has not\nproduced admissible evidence to support his conspiracy claim. (D.I. 86 at 13-15) See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(c)(1)(B) (\u201cA party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must\nsupport the assertion by showing . . . that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\nsupport the fact.\u201d).\n\nSpecifically, Defendants argue the only evidence supporting the conspiracy is Sweigart\u2019s\nrecorded inadmissible hearsay statements on the courthouse steps. (D.I. 86 at 15) Further,\nDefendants argue that the deposition testimony of Gas Recovery\u2019s principal Brandon Mullins\nrefutes Sweigart\u2019s statements entirely because Mullins testified that there was never a video\nrecorder on the tow truck. (/d. at 13-14; D.I. 92 at 7; see D.I. 91, Ex. 8 at 13:9-17)\n\nPlaintiff argues Sweigart\u2019s statements are admissible under various hearsay exceptions.\n(D.I. 89 at 14-20) In addition, Plaintiff asserts there is other evidence supporting his conspiracy\nclaim. (/d. at 10-14) For example, Plaintiff contends the omission of facts from Defendant\nSpicer\u2019s Investigative Narrative Report, the inconsistencies in testimony among the Officers, and\nthe various conversations Defendants Spicer and Weir had with Sweigart all support his\n\nconspiracy claim. (/d. at 10-13; see D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 52:10-53:9; 58:6-59:10; D.I. 91, Ex. 9;\nD.I. 91, Ex. 10 at 50:19-22; D.I. 91, Ex. 11 at 118:07-121:03) Additionally, Plaintiff argues that\nthe absence of video footage draws an adverse inference that Defendants directed the destruction\nof the evidence as part of their cover-up. (D.I. 89 at 13-14)\n\n\u201cTo prevail on a conspiracy claim under [section] 1983, a plaintiff must prove that\npersons acting under color of state law \u2018reached an understanding\u2019 to deprive him of his\nconstitutional rights.\u201d Jutrowski v. Twp. of Riverdale, 904 F.3d 280, 293-94 (3d Cir. 2018)\n(quoting Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 150-52 (1970)). Circumstantial evidence\ncan be used to demonstrate an agreement in the absence of direct proof. Id. at 295. Additionally,\nwhen the alleged conspirators are police officers, circumstantial evidence may include\n\u201cconversations between officers about the incident, allegedly distorted stories that emerged, and\nawareness of conflicting stories and irregularities in the series of official investigations into the\nincident.\u201d Jd. Weighing the circumstantial evidence \u201cis among the chief tasks of factfinders.\u201d\nId.\n\nCompletely absent from Defendants\u2019 brief is any discussion of the elements of a\nconspiracy claim under section 1983. Thus, Defendants have failed to support their Motion with\nany legal argument as to why they contend the elements for a conspiracy claim are not satisfied\nas a matter of law. Instead, Defendants drafted what amounts to a motion in limine arguing that\nSweigart\u2019s recorded statement made on the courthouse steps on the date of the Plaintiff's\ncriminal trial is inadmissible. The issue of the admissibility of Sweigart\u2019s recorded statement is\nnot presently before the court.\n\nSetting aside the lack of legal support for Defendants\u2019 Motion, the court cannot grant the\nConspiracy Motion due to the disputed material facts concerning whether a video of the\n\nrepossession ever existed, and if so, whether it was destroyed. The Plaintiff's testimony is that\nSweigart told him he had a camera in the tow truck and that the Plaintiff saw a \u201cgreen dot of\nlight\u201d coming from an area near the driver\u2019s seat. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 129:16-134:16)\n\nAdditionally, evidence from the Defendants does not rule out the possibility that a video\nof the incident was captured. Defendant Spicer testified to seeing a \u201cvideo camera on the\nrepossession truck.\u201d (D.I. 91, Ex. 4 at 14:10-16) Defendant Hurd testified that Sweigart told\nhim \u201ceverything has been recorded\u201d and gave Defendant Hurd his business card to call him to\nobtain a copy. (D.I. 91, Ex. 11 at 66:23-67:21) Further, Defendants Spicer and Weir wrote in\ntheir Use of Force Reports that a video was captured by the tow truck operator and that\nDefendant Hurd was in charge of securing a copy. (D.I. 91, Exs. 13-14 at 3, 7; see also D.I. 91,\nEx. 9 at 5)\n\nDefendants attempt to refute their own evidence with Mullins\u2019 testimony that the\nrepossession trucks are not equipped with video recorders and the Officers must have mistakenly\nbelieved that the license plate reader on the tow truck was a video recorder. (D.I. 86 at 13-14;\nD.I. 92 at 7; see also D.I. 86, Ex. D at 13:9-17; 82:3-25)\n\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the court finds material\nissues of fact exist from which a jury could infer a conspiracy to cover-up Defendants\u2019 alleged\nwrongdoing during the vehicle repossession, thus, precluding summary judgment in favor of the\nDefendants. See Cosby v. Magnotta, No. 3:10-CV-01881, 2014 WL 694998, at *10 (M.D. Pa.\nFeb. 24, 2014) (denying the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion regarding the plaintiff's\nconspiracy claim because the record contained enough circumstantial evidence from which a jury\n\ncould infer that they conspired to violate the plaintiff's constitutional rights).\n\n10\nB. Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden for Summary Judgment on the\nPlaintiff's Due Process Claim\n\nDefendants argue the Plaintiff's due process claim for affirmatively aiding in a civil\nrepossession should be dismissed because Defendants Spicer and Weir were responding to a\ndisorderly conduct call. (D.I. 88 at 11-13)\n\nIn assessing Plaintiff's claim that Defendants deprived him of his due process rights,\n\u201c[t]he relevant inquiry .. . is whether [the officers] affirmatively aided a repossession such that\n[the officers] can be said to have caused the constitutional deprivation.\u201d Harvey v. Plains Twp.\nPolice Dep\u2019t, 635 F.3d 606, 610 (3d Cir. 2011). \u201cSuch aid may take the form of facilitation,\nencouragement, direction, compulsion, or other affirmative assistance in the repossession.\u201d Id.\nAn officer who \u201cmaintains neutrality\u201d in a repossession effort does not violate section 1983, but\n\u201cliability will . . . attach when an officer plays a \u2018principal role\u2019 in the seizure.\u201d Jd. (citing Abbott\nv. Latshaw, 164 F.3d 141, 147 (3d Cir. 1998)). Further, \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the\npolice officer\u2019s role in the private repossession must be examined in their totality.\u201d Id.\n\nDefendants have collectively moved for summary judgment, without asking the court to\nseparately consider the conduct of each Officer. The Defendants fail to cite any legal authority\nin support of their Motion. Instead, Defendants rely solely on the labeling of the incident as it\nappears in a Computer Aided Dispatch (\u201cCAD\u201d) report. (D.I. 88 at 11) The incident was\nlabelled a report of \u201cdisorderly conduct.\u201d (/d., Ex. C) In deciding summary judgment, the court\nconsiders the facts in the record. The labelling of an incident in a form created by a police\ndispatch operator is not dispositive.\n\nHere, based upon the factual record, the court finds a reasonable jury could conclude that\nthe Defendant Officers were more than neutral observers to the repossession of Plaintiff's\n\nDurango. The key factual dispute is whether Defendants acted in response to a disorderly\n\n11\nconduct call or aided a civil repossession. Defendants claim they were responding to a\ndisorderly conduct call because the CAD report of the incident mentions disorderly conduct.\n(DL. 88 at 11; see id, Ex. C) Plaintiff argues that the CAD report is completed after the fact and\nthat the radio transmissions about the incident reveal the Defendant Officers were directed to\narrive at the Country Club Apartments to assist in the repossession of a vehicle. (D.I. 90 at 14;\nsee DJ. 91, Ex. 6; see also D.I. 91, Ex. 4 at 84:8-85:5; D.I. 91, Ex. 5 at 107:4-109:21)\n\nMoreover, the Defendants do not dispute that Defendant Spicer handed the Plaintiff's\nkeys to Sweigart who drove away with Plaintiff's vehicle. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 84:11-19) A jury\ncould reasonably find that such conduct amounts to affirmative assistance in the repossession.\n\nPlaintiff further contends that Defendants Weir and Spicer, after two conversations with\nSweigart and numerous attempts to persuade the Plaintiff to exit the vehicle, resorted to physical\nforce against the Plaintiff. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 52:05-61:2) The Defendant Officers allegedly used\nexcessive force to remove the Plaintiff from his vehicle for the purpose of allowing Sweigart to\ncomplete the repossession. (Id. at 61:3-74:20)\n\nTherefore, the court finds that a reasonable jury could determine that the Defendants\naffirmatively aided the repossession such that their conduct caused the alleged constitutional\ndeprivation. See Hyman v. Morris, 320 F. Supp. 3d 707, 716-17 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (finding a\nreasonable jury could conclude that the police officer affirmatively aided the repossession when\nthe officer ordered the plaintiff out of the vehicle and threatened to forcibly remove and arrest\nher for disorderly conduct if she did not comply). Therefore, summary judgment on Plaintiff's\n\ndue process claim is denied.\n\n12\nCc. Defendants Have Not Met Their Burden for Summary Judgment on the\nPlaintiff's Wrongful Arrest Claim\n\nDefendants argue that the facts are undisputed that there was probable cause to arrest the\nPlaintiff for disorderly conduct under Delaware law. (D.I. 88 at 13-15) Defendants\u2019 Motion\nfails because it consists of nothing more than conclusory assertions that the legal requirements\nfor disorderly conduct and probable cause have been satisfied.\n\nA wrongful arrest claim requires a plaintiff to establish: \u201c(1) that there was an arrest; and -\n(2) that the arrest was made without probable cause.\u201d James v. City of Wilkes-Barre, 700 F.3d\n675, 680 (3d Cir. 2012). Probable cause is present \u201cwhen the facts and circumstances within [the\nofficer\u2019s] knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a reasonable person to believe that\nan offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.\u201d Wagner v. N. Berks\nReg\u2019l Police Dep\u2019t, 816 F. App\u2019x 679, 682 (3d Cir. 2020).\n\nViewing the record in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the court finds that there is\na genuine dispute of material facts as to whether there was probable cause to arrest Plaintiff for\ndisorderly conduct.\n\nThe Plaintiff admits to activating the horn on the vehicle prior to the Defendant Officers\u2019\narrival but argues his conduct was not disorderly. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 51:1-13) Plaintiff states he\nactivated the horn for safety reasons because he wanted to stop the tow truck operator from\nlifting the vehicle further off of the ground while he occupied it and to alert his friend in the\n\napartment complex. (/d. at 85:20-87:1).\n\n6 \u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct when . . .[tJhe person intentionally causes public\ninconvenience, annoyance or alarm to any other person, or creates a risk thereof by . . . [mJaking\nan unreasonable noise or an offensively coarse utterance, gesture or display, or addressing\nabusive language to any person present[.]\u201d Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 1301(1)(b) (1995).\n\n13\nThere is a factual dispute regarding who was responsible for activating the horn after the\nOfficers arrived. Plaintiff contends that it was not him but Defendant Weir who honked the\nvehicle\u2019s horn in the effort to remove the Plaintiff from it. (D.I. 91, Ex. 3 at \u00a75) Plaintiff alleges\nDefendant Weir\u2019s elbow activated the vehicle\u2019s horn when he tried to push the window down in\nan attempt to open the door. (D.I. 91, Ex. 1 at 62:07-64:11) However, Defendants Spicer and\nWeir contend the Plaintiff yelled and activated his horn after they arrived at the scene and\ndisturbed the residents in the apartment complex. (D.I. 91, Ex. 4 at 81:1-12; 82:5-7; D.L. 91, Ex.\n5 at 20:10-15)\n\nThe court denies summary judgment on the Plaintiff's wrongful arrest claim because the\nmaterial facts are disputed and a reasonable jury could find that the Defendant Officers did not\nhave probable cause to arrest the Plaintiff for disorderly conduct.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES Defendants\u2019 Conspiracy Motion and Due\n\nProcess Motion. (D.I. 85; D.I. 87) An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall\n\nissue.\n\nDated: February / , 2023\nSherry R.
