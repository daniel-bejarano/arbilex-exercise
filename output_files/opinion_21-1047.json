Lemieux , SQUIRE PATTON BOGGS , Palo Alto, CA . \n \nCounsel for Defendant . \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nJanuary 21, 2022 \n \n \n  2 \n To profit from their ingenuity , inventors must  protect their designs . But they may \nnot falsely  malign  competing products as rip- offs. Here, a solar panel inventor , So-\nlaria,  publicly accused a rival , Tongwei Solar , of infringing its patents. Believing  that \nSolaria\u2019s accusations were made  up, Tongwei sued  for trade libel plus interference \nwith contractual and business relations . Though its claims are plausible, I stay this \ncase pending the outcome of a related German suit involving Solaria\u2019s patents \u2014the \nresult there may simplify this litigation .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nSolaria designs, patents, and sells solar panels. D.I. 1 \u00b6 \u00b6 7\u20139. In 2019,  it began to \nsuspect that a competitor, Tongwei, had  started using its patented designs. Id. \u00b6 10. \nSo it demanded that Tongwei  either buy a license or stop selling infringing products. \nId.  \nTongwei pushed back, asserting that its own investigation revealed no patent in-\nfringement. Id. \u00b6 15. It asked Solaria to give  specific examples, but, it says, Solaria \nnever did. Id. \u00b6 16. So T ongwei kept making  its panels.  \nUndeterred, Solaria wrote to Tongwei\u2019s customers and distributors, telling  them \nthat Tongwei was \u201cviolat[ing] Solaria\u2019s intellectual property.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 16\u201317. Plus, it \nsued two of Tongwei\u2019s customers  in Germany , alleging that their use of Tongwei\u2019s \npanels also infringe d Solaria \u2019s patents . Id. \u00b6 24; D.I. 10, at 1; D.I. 11, at 1.  \nTongwei claims that Solaria\u2019s accusations are  \u201cmisleading\u201d because \u201c Solaria ha [d] \nno legitimate basis to allege that Tongwei\u2019s products infringe any valid \u2026 patent.\u201d \nD.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 25. So it sued  Solaria for trade libel, interference with business relations, \nand interference with contract. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 29\u221235.  3 \n Now Solaria moves to dismiss. It  argues that Tongwei\u2019s  claims are  preempted by \nfederal patent law  and, in any case, are  baseless . D.I. 9, at 6 \u22129. Alternatively, it asks \nme to stay this case until a German court has resolved the patent suit  against Tong-\nwei\u2019s customers. Id.  at 10.  \nII. IT IS TOO SOON TO TELL IF TONGWEI \u2019S CLAIMS ARE PREEMPTED  \nSolaria contends that Tongwei\u2019s state -law claims are preempted by  federal law. \nBut on the record  before me, this case involves no federal interest.   \nFederal law encourages patent holders to confront possible infringers. \u201c Patents \nwould be of little value if infringers \u2026 could not be notified of the consequences of \ninfringement.\u201d Virtue v. Creamery Package Mfg. , 227 U.S. 8, 37\u221228 (1913).  Plus, giv-\ning infringers the chance to stop help s avoid costly litigation.  \nYet patent holders may hesitate  to notify infringers if doing so risks  state tort \nliability.  So \u201c[f] ederal patent law \u2026 preempts state -law tort liability when a [patent \nholder] in good faith communicates allegations of infringement .\u201d Dominant Semicon-\nductors S dn. Bhd. v. OSRAM GmbH , 524 F.3d 1254, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2008). To survive \npreemption, a tort plaintiff must allege that the patent holder made his allegations \nin bad faith, \u201ceven if bad faith is not otherwise an element of the tort claim.\u201d Id.  (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).  \nBut that rule applies only if an American patent is at issue . Without that, the \nfederal interest in letting  U.S.-patent holders assert th eir rights is not implicated.  \nHere, it is not  yet clear if  an U.S. patent is involved . As Tongwei explains, \u201cSolaria \ndoes not assert that Tongwei is infringing any U.S. patents.\u201d D.I. 17, at 5. Indeed, the \nrecord mentions only European and Australian patents . D.I. 17 -1, at 1.  4 \n Later in this litigation, d iscovery may show that Solaria told Tongwei\u2019s  customers \nthat Tongwei stole U.S. -patented designs . And i f that happens, Tongwei will have to \nprove  that Solaria acted in bad faith to survive preemption . Dominant Semiconduc-\ntors, 524 F.3d at 1260.  \nIII. TWO OUT OF THREE CLAIMS MAY PROCEED  \nSolaria argues that all three of Tongwei\u2019s  claims fail. It says trade libel is not a \nrecognized cause of action in Delaware. Then  it contends Tongwei\u2019s allegations of in-\nterference with contract and business relations fall short of the pleading standard. \nD.I. 9, at 8 \u20139. Just one of those arguments hits the mark: Tongwei fails to allege \ninterference with contract. But its  trade -libel and business -relations -interference  \nclaims  may proceed.  \nA. Trade libel  \nThough  Solaria  disputes it,  Delaware lets plaintiffs sue for trade libel. See Incyte \nCorp. v. Flexus Biosciences, Inc. , 2017 WL 7803923, at *7 (Del. Sup. Ct. Nov. 1, 2017);  \nDasso Int\u2019l, Inc. v. MOSO N. Am., Inc., 2018 WL 4626049, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 26, \n2018). To state a claim, Tongwei must show that Solaria knowingly or recklessly lied \nabout Tongwei\u2019s business, that it intend ed to cause it a financial loss, and that it in \nfact suffered that loss . Incyte Corp. , 2017 WL 7803923, at *7.  \nThat is exactly what Tongwei says happened here. Solaria told Tongwei\u2019s  custom-\ners that it was infringing Solaria\u2019s patents, yet it could not \u201cidentify any specific ex-amples of patent infringement.\u201d D.I. 1 \u00b6  16. And though Tongwei repeatedly asked \n\u201cwhich of Solaria\u2019s patents were purportedly relevant,\u201d Solaria \u201crefused to prov ide \nth[at] information.\u201d Id. \u00b6 22. Taken as  true, those facts suggest that Solaria had no 5 \n basis for its allegations. And making baseless allegations shows a reckless disregard \nfor the truth. Cf. Neurotron Inc. v. Med . Serv. Ass\u2019n of Pa. , Inc. , 254 F.3d 444, 453 (3d \nCir. 2001) ( affirming  summary judgment for  a defendant  whose  misleading state-\nments had a \u201crational basis\u201d).   \nPlus, Solaria allegedly intended to cause Tongwei financial harm. Solaria\u2019s  letters \nwere \u201cattempts to scare Tongwei\u2019s customers and distributors into not buying Tong-wei\u2019s products.\u201d D.I. 1 \u00b6  26. And Tongwei says the letters succeeded: they \u201ctarnished \n[its] reputation, interfere[d] with [its] relationships with clients \u2026. [and caused it to] \nlos[e] business opportunities.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27. \nB. Interference with business relations  \nTo state a claim, Tongwei must allege that Solaria intentionally interfered with \nits \u201creasonab[ly] probab[ le]\u201d business opportunities, causing it to lose money. Mal-\npiede v. Townson , 780 A.2d 1075, 1099 (Del. 2001). Plus, Solaria\u2019s interference must \nhave gone beyond its right \u201cto compete or protect [its] business interests in a fair and lawful manner.\u201d Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nTongwei checks those boxes. It claims that  it regularly sold its products to cus-\ntomer companies, including Hyundai and BayWa, and that it wished to continue to do so. D.I. 1 \u00b6  8. That counts as a reasonably probable business opportunity. See Beard \nRsch., Inc. v. Kates, 8 A.3d 573, 608 (Del. Ch. 20 10) (enough to show \u201can expectation \nthat [a] business relation[ship] will continue\u201d).  \nTongwei claims that Solaria interfered with that opportunity by telling the cus-\ntomer s that Tongwei was infringing its patents. D.I. 1 \u00b6 26. Solaria\u2019s letters reflect a \n\u201cspecific intent\u201d to convince the customers to cancel their relationships with Tongwei 6 \n and to work with Solaria  instead . Beard Rsch. , 8 A.3d at 608 \u201309. And if those letters \nwere baseless, Solaria likely went beyond its right to compete in the market.  \nC. Interference with contract  \nTo plead that Solaria interfered with its contracts, Tongwei\u2019s complaint must iden-\ntify specific contracts that Solaria caused Tongwei\u2019s  customers to breach. Irwin & \nLeighton, Inc. v. W.M. Anderson Co ., 532 A.2d 983, 992 (Del. Ch. 1987).  \nYet Tongwei does not do that. It does not say whether it had ongoing contracts \nwith its customer s or distributors. Nor does it explain whether Solaria\u2019s letters \ncaused customers to breach those contracts. Instead, the complaint vaguely gestures \nat disrupted \u201crelationships\u201d and \u201copportunities.\u201d D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 34\u201335. That is not enough.  \nThus, its interference -with -contract claim fails. But I dismiss it without prejudice. \nTongwei may still try to  identify specific contracts that suffered from Solaria\u2019s cam-\npaign.  \nIV. I AM STAY ING THIS CASE  \nSolaria asks me to stay this case pending the outcome of its German patent - \ninfringement suit against Tongwei\u2019s customers. D.I. 9, at 10. It says the result there \nwill simplify this litigation : if the German court finds that the customer\u2019s Tongwei -\nmanufactured products infringe Solaria\u2019s patents, then Solaria\u2019s accusations were not \nbaseless. I agree, so I grant a stay.  \nDistrict courts have discretion to stay a case pending the resolution of other judi-\ncial or administrative proceedings. That \u201ccalls for the exercise of judgment, which \nmust weigh [the parties\u2019] competing interests and maintain an even balance\u201d  between \nthem.  Landis v. N . Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254\u221255 (1936).  7 \n True, federal courts should rarely stay litigation for \u201cparallel proceedings in a for-\neign forum.\u201d Gross v. German Found . Indus. Initiative , 456 F.3d 363, 393 (3d Cir. \n2006). But that rule applies when the  only reason for the stay is \u201cinternational com-\nity,\u201d that is, respect for the \u201cjudicial acts of another nation.\u201d Id. at 392. Comity does \nnot ordinarily outweigh a  court\u2019s \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation\u201d to exercise its ju-\nrisdiction. Id. at 394 (quoting Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States , \n424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976)).  \nBut here, international comity is not at issue. Solaria does not ask me to let a \nforeign tribunal decide  this case , depriving Tongwei of its right to have a federal court \nweigh in . The German suit involves different claims and different parties, so a judg-\nment there would not stop  me from adjudicating the merits here. Cf. Royal & Sun \nAll. Ins. Co. of Can . v. Century Int\u2019l Arms, Inc., 466 F.3d 88, 92\u221293 (2d Cir. 2006) \n(noting the res judicata effect of some foreign judgments).  \nInstead, efficiency favors waiting until the German court has resolved Solaria\u2019s \npatent -infringement claims. Unlike me, the German court has expertise to address \nSolaria\u2019s European patent claims. And if it finds that Solaria\u2019s claims have merit, \nthat is st rong evidence that its allegations against Tongwei were not baseless . Indeed, \nin similar domestic cases, federal courts grant stays to let the Patent & Trademark Office weigh in. See, e.g. , Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F.2d 1422, 1426\u2013 27 (Fed. Cir. \n1988) . (approving a stay to allow the Patent & Trademark Office to reexamine a pa-\ntent).  \nThus, I grant a stay until the German court decides Solaria\u2019s patent case. But if 8 \n there is no final disposition in six months\u2019 time, Tongwei may ask me to lift the stay.  \n* * * * * \nTongwei plausibly says  Solaria made up patent -infringement allegations against \nit. So its trade- libel and interference- with -business -relations claims may proceed. But  \nit fails to identify  any contract that Solaria interfered with, so I dismiss that claim \nwithout prejudice. And because the related German patent suit may simplify this \ndispute,  I grant a stay .  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nTONGWEI SOLAR HEFEI CO. LTD., \nINC. , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nSOLARIA  CORP.,  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21- cv-1047-SB \n \nORDER  \n1. I GRANT IN PART  Solaria\u2019s motion to dismiss [D.I. 8]. I dismiss Tongwei\u2019s \ninterference-with- contract claims  without prejudice . Its trade -libel and inter-\nference- with -business -relations claims may proceed.  \n2. I GRANT Solaria\u2019s motion to stay this case [D.I. 8] pending the outcome of a \nrelated German patent- infringement suit. But if that litigation is still ongoing \nin six months \u2014July 21, 2022\u2014Tongwei may ask me to lift the stay.  \n \nDated: January  21, 2022   ____________________________________ \n      UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n"}
