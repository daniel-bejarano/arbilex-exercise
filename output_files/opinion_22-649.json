Roark (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cRoark\u2019\u201d) removed this state\ncriminal matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446. (D.I. 1) He moves to dismiss the\ncriminal action, and Plaintiff asks this Court to summarily remand the matter for\nlack of jurisdiction. (D.I. 4, 6)\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nOn April 17, 2022, Defendant was issued several traffic violations by New\nCastle County Police Officer Nikituk. (D.I. 1-1 at 1) Defendant was summoned to\nappear before the Justice of the Peace Court 11 on May 11, 2022. (/d.) Defendant\nchallenged the tickets in state court on the grounds that the New Castle County\nPolice Department lacked standing as no crime was committed and no injury\noccurred. (/d. at 3-4) Trial was set for June 21, 2022. (/d. at 5) Defendant\nremoved this matter on May 17, 2022. The civil cover sheet indicates the matter\nwas removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446 and describes the cause of action as\nviolations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nand the Supremacy Clause. (D.I. 1-2)\n\nOn June 8, 2022, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal matter in\nthis Court again asserting lack of standing and no injury occurred. (D.I. 4) The\n\nCourt ordered Plaintiff to respond to the motion. (D.I. 5) Plaintiff argues that\nDefendant\u2019s removal of the criminal matter was improper, this Court lacks\njurisdiction, and asks the Court to deny Defendant\u2019s motion. (DI. 6)\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nIn order for a case to be removable to the district court, the Court must have\noriginal jurisdiction by either a federal question or diversity of citizenship. 28\nUS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, 1441. \u201cOnly state-court actions that originally could have\nbeen filed in federal court may be removed to federal court by the defendant.\u201d\nKline v. Security Guards, Inc., 386 F.3d 246, 252 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting\nCaterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987)). If the case could not have\nbeen filed originally in federal court, then removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 is\nimproper and remand is appropriate. Jd. (citations omitted).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nRemoval of state criminal matters is permitted in limited instances under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1443. Pursuant to \u00a7 1443(1), a criminal prosecution commenced in a\nState court may be removed to the district court of the United States for the district\nand division embracing the place wherein it is pending against any person who is\ndenied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing\nfor the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the\njurisdiction thereof. 28 U.S.C. 1443(1). A state court defendant who seeks\n\nremoval of a criminal prosecution to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1)\n\u201cmust demonstrate both (1) that he is being deprived of rights guaranteed by a\nfederal law \u2018providing for . . . equal civil rights\u2019; and (2) that he is \u2018denied or\ncannot enforce that right in the courts\u2019 of the state.\u201d Davis v. Glanton, 107 F.3d\n1044, 1047 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 788 (1966)).\nWith respect to the first prong, \u201cthe phrase \u2018any law providing for . . . equal civil\nrights\u2019 must be construed to mean any law providing for specific civil rights stated\nin terms of racial equality.\u201d Rachel, 384 at 792 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(a)).\nSecond, it must appear, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 1443(1), that the\nremoval petitioner is denied or cannot enforce the specified federal rights in the\ncourts of the State. Johnson v. Mississippi, 421 U.S. 213, 219 (1975) (citations\nomitted).\n\nDefendant alleges in a conclusory manner violations of his rights under the\nFourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He does not\nassert that he cannot get a fair and impartial trial or that he is denied equal access\nto the Justice of the Peace Court. Defendant\u2019s position that the State of Delaware\ndoes not have standing to prosecute him is without merit. There are no assertions\nthat provide a basis for this Court\u2019s proposed exercise of subject matter\njurisdiction. Nor are there allegations that Defendant cannot enforce his asserted\nrights in state court. In re Weddington, 2008 WL 686381 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 12,\n\n2008); see also State v. Haws, 131 F.3d 1205, 1209 (7th Cir. 1997). The notice of\nremoval simply does not lead to the conclusion that Defendant cannot enforce any\nasserted rights in state court. Moreover, it is generally presumed that \u201cthe\nprotection of federal constitutional or statutory rights [can] be effected in the\npending state proceedings, civil or criminal.\u201d Johnson, 421 U.S. at 219-20. For\nthe above reasons, the Court will summarily remand this criminal matter.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons the Court will: (1) dismiss as moot Defendant\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss (D.I. 4); and (2) summarily remand this matter to the Justice of\nthe Peace Court 1 lof the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County (Case\nNo. 2204008836).\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}
