No. 20- 1327- CFC -JLH \n      \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nPlaintiff Tracy A. Charlier  appeals from an unfavorable  decision of the Commissioner of  \nthe Social  Security  Administration1 denying her  application for disability  insurance benefits  \n(\u201cDIB\u201d) .  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).   \nThe parties filed cross -motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 19; D.I. 24.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on February 11, 2022, I recommend that the Court DENY Plaintiff \u2019s \nmotion and GRANT the Commissioner \u2019s cross- motion , as I conclude that the Comm issioner \u2019s \ndecision  is supported by substantial evidence and that there are no reversible errors.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence  \u201cmeans \u2014and means only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d  Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019)  (quoting Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)) .  In reviewing \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kij akazi \nwas automatically substituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she succeeded him on July 9, 2021.  2 \n whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts  may not \u201cre -weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d  Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011) ; see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014) .  In other \nwords, r eviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner  follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis , and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail: \nThe first two steps involve threshold determina tions.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is found to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissi oner compares the medical \nevidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer \nfrom a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work .  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating \nan inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final  step.  At this stage, the burden of \nproduction shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy \nwhich the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of 3 \n all the clai mant \u2019s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n \nNewell v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545 \u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks  disability insurance benefits  or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench on February 11, 2022, as \nfollows:  \nI\u2019m ready to give you m y reports and recommendations on \nthe cross -motions for summary judgment in Hight v. Kijakazi  and \nthe cross -motions for summary judgment in Charlier v. Kijakazi . \n \nI will summarize the reasons for my recommendations in a \nmoment.   But before I do, I want to be clear that my failure to \naddress a particular argument advanced by a party does not mean that I did not consider it.  We have carefully considered the pertinent portions of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs in both cases.  I am not going to read my understanding of the applicable \nlaw into the record today; however, we will incorporate the rulings I am about to state into a separate, written document, and we will include a summary of the applicable law in that document.  \n. . . .  Now we \u2019ll move on to the Charlier matter.  I recommend that \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment be  denied and that the \nCommissioner\u2019s cross -motion for summary judgment be granted.  \n Plaintiff Tracy A. Charlier is a woman in her fifties who \npreviously worked as  a District Sales Manager for Avon Beauty and \nas a real estate agent.  In 2015, she fell at work and injured her neck and low back.  She filed an application for benefits claiming that she has been disabled since September 30, 2016.  \n  The ALJ who ruled on Ms. Charlier \u2019s application for \ndisability benefits found at s tep two that she had three severe \nimpairments: degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine, neuropathy, and obesity.  As part of his s tep two analysis, the ALJ \nalso evaluated whether Charlier  had any medically determinable 4 \n mental impairments.2  The ALJ concluded that Charlier  had a \nmedically determinable mental impairment of depression, so he \nwent on to rate the degree of her functional limitation resulting from \nher depression in accordance with the four criteria commonly referred to as the \u201c Paragraph B \u201d criteria.\n3  He conclu ded that \nCharlier \u2019s depression \u201c cause[d] no more than \u2018 mild\u2019 limitation in \nany of the functional areas and  the evidence d[id] not otherwise \nindicate that there is more than a minimal limitation in [her] ability to do basic work activities. \u201d\n4  Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that \nher depression was not severe.5   \n At step three, the ALJ found that Charlier \u2019s impairments did \nnot meet the standards for a listed impairment, so he went on to s tep \nfour.   \n At step four, the ALJ found that Charlier had the residual \nfunctional capacity ( \u201cRFC \u201d) \u201cto perform sedentary work [ as defined \nin 20 C .F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a) ] except she can occasionally climb \nramps and stairs, but never climb ladders, ropes, or  scaffolds; she \ncan occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; she can occasionally push, pull, and reach overhead with the dominant upper right extremity; she can fr equently handle and finger with the \n \n2 See 20 C .F.R. 404.1520a(b)(1).     \n \n3 Id. at 404.1520a(b)(2), (c )(3) (\u201cWe have identified four broad functional areas in which \nwe will rate the degree of your functional limitation: Understand, remember, or apply information; interact with others; concentrate, persist, or maintain pace; and adapt or manage oneself. \u201d); see \nalso 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, s ubpt. P, a pp. 1, 12.00E.\n   \n \n4 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings, D.I. 13 (\u201cRecord\u201d or \u201cR.\u201d), at 21.)   Charlier \nasserts that \u201c [t]he ALJ made no determination regarding her ability to adapt or manage.\u201d   (D.I. 20 \nat 2; D.I. 28 at 3.)  I disagree.  I acknowledge that one portion of the ALJ \u2019s analysis appears to \ncontain a typo.  ( R. 20 (\u201cThe claimant has the following degree of limitation in the four broad areas \nof mental functioning . . . [:] X limitation in adapting or managing oneself .\u201d).)  However, the ALJ \u2019s \nopinion goes on to discuss evidence that Charlier \u201c has appropriate mood and affect, [and]  normal \njudgment and insight,\u201d  and it sets forth an express finding (at step two ) that Charlier \u2019s depression \n\u201ccauses no more than \u2018mild\u2019 limitation in any  of the functional areas. \u201d (R. 20-21 (emphasis \nadded ).)  In other words, the ALJ found that Charlier had no more than a mild limitation in her \nability to adapt and mana ge herself.  Moreover, Charlier has not specifically pointed this Court to \nevidence that she in fact had more than any m ild difficulties in adapting and managing herself.   \n \n5 See 20 C .F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(d)(1) ( \u201cIf we rate the degrees of your limitation as \u201cnone\u201d or \n\u201cmild,\u201d we will generally conclude that your impairment(s) is not severe, unless the evidence otherwise indicates that there is more than a minimal limitation in your ability to do basic work activities. \u201d). \n 5 \n dominant right upper extremity; she can have occasional exposure \nto vibration and hazards, such as moving machinery and unprotected heights.\u201d\n6 The ALJ found that, given that RFC, Charlier could not \nperform her past rele vant work.7 \n   At the last step, the ALJ found that, notwithstanding \nCharlier \u2019s limitations, a person with her background and prior work \nexperience could work as a telemarketer.  Accordingly, the ALJ found that Charlier was not disabled.\n8 \n Charlier chall enges two aspects of the ALJ \u2019s decision.   Her \nfirst argument is that the ALJ \u2019s step two  finding that her depression \nwas not severe is not supported by substantial evidence.\n9   I disagree.  \nThe ALJ sufficiently articulated, with specific citations to the evidentiary record, why he found Charlier \u2019s impairments did not \nqualify as severe.  Among other things, the ALJ considered Charlier \u2019s own statements about depression, but he found them \ninconsistent with other portions of the record indicating minimal treatm ent for depression and that medication improved her \ndepression symptoms.\n10 \n The ALJ also noted that the mental status exams showed \nappropriate mood and affect, normal judgment and insight, and intact recent and remote memory.\n11  The ALJ also considered the  \nfact that Charlier noted worsening depression to her primary care provider in 2019 related to certain life events, but that she had failed to follow up as recommended.\n12   \n Charlier argues that the ALJ \u201c fail[ed] to consider \u201d evidence \nfrom Dr. Romirowsky and Dr. Simon, but the ALJ clearly did \n \n6 (R. 22.)  \n \n7 (R. 26.)  \n \n8 (R. 27.)  \n \n9 (D.I. 20 at 12.)   \n \n10 (R. 20 ( citing 6F/49; 10F/2; 12F/5; 13F/3; 18F4- 5).)  For example, Dr. Romirowsky\u2019 s \nnotes indicate that Charlier  \u201cfeels depressed \u201d but that Cymbalta, which was prescribed for pain, \nseem ed to be improving her depression.  (R. 799- 803.)  \n \n11 (R. 20 (citing 1F/2 -5, 20F ).) \n   \n12 (R. 20 (citing 18F ).) \n 6 \n consider that evidence because the ALJ cited to their notes in his \nstep two  analysis.13 \n In short, there is no reason to think that the ALJ failed to \nconsider evidence relevant to the que stion of whether  Charlier \u2019s \ndepression was \u201c severe \u201d within the meaning of the regulations.  It is \nnot the role of this Court to reweigh the evidence.  The ALJ \u2019s finding \nthat Charlier \u2019s depression was not severe is supported by substantial \nevidence.  Accord ingly, the Court should reject Charlier \u2019s argument \nthat the ALJ erred at s tep two .  \n I now turn to Charlier \u2019s second challenge to the ALJ \u2019s \ndecision.  She argues that the ALJ erred at s tep four by failing to \ninclude limitations in the RFC related to her de pression.  I disagree.  \n As an initial matter, no one here disputes that the ALJ was \nrequired at s tep four  to consider all of Charlier \u2019s impairments, even \nthose that he found to be not severe.\n14 \n The ALJ did that.  His lengthy s tep four analysis included a \ndetailed discussion of Charlier \u2019s physical limitations as well as her  \nclaimed mental limitations.  In particular, the ALJ carefully analyzed evidence relevant to the imposition of limitations stemming from her depression, including, for example, her abilit y \nto follow instructions, her ability to sustain work performance and attendance, her ability to understand, remember and apply information, her ability to interact with the public, and her ability to exercise appropriate judgment.\n15  He also considered Charlier \u2019s \ntestimony that \u201c she is very forgetful with difficulty concentrating on \ntasks, \u201d but he nevertheless found that her own \u201c statements \nconcerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of [her] symptoms [were] not entir ely consistent \u201d with the other evidence of \n \n13 (See R. 20 (citing 10F, 12F, and 13F ).)  Charlier also claims that the ALJ failed to \nconsider evidence from Dr. Lifrak.  But Dr. Lifrak\u2019 s notes don\u2019 t reflect anything about how \nPlaintiff \u2019s depression affected her ability to work.  ( See R. 773- 777 (noting that plaintiff had \nreported emotional depression).)  \n \n14 See Rutherford v. Barnhart , 399 F.3d 546, 554 n.7 (3d Cir. 2005)  (\u201cAlthough the \nimpairment must be medically determinable, it need not be a \u2018 severe\u2019  impairment to be considered \nin the RFC assessment.\u201d); see also  20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1523 (\u201c[W]e will consider the combined effect \nof all of your impairments without regard to w hether such impairment, if considered separately, \nwould be of sufficient severity.\u201d).  \n \n15 (R. 22- 23, 25- 26.)   \n 7 \n record.16  Thus, while the ALJ did not ultimately include limitations \nspecifically related to Charlier \u2019s depression in the RFC, there is no \nquestion that the ALJ considered evidence related to Charlier \u2019s \ndepressio n in the RFC assessment.  \n \nCharlier \u2019s real argument is that, once the ALJ found at s tep \ntwo that Charlier had \u201c mild\u201d limitations with respect to the \nParagraph B criteria, the ALJ was required to include those same \nlimitations in the RFC.17  \n I reject that argument.  For one thing, \u201c unlike the findings at \nstep[] two . . . , the RFC \u2018 must be expressed in terms of work -related \nfunctions[,] \u2019 such as by describing the claimant\u2019s \u2018 abilities to: \nunderstand, carry out, and remember instructions; use judgment in maki ng work- related decisions; respond appropriately to \nsupervision, co- workers and work situations; and deal with changes \nin a routine work setting. \u201d\n18  In other words, \u201cthe findings at step[] \ntwo . . . will not necessarily translate to the language used at s teps \nfour and five. \u201d19   \n I also reject the proposition that the ALJ was required to \ninclude limitations in the RFC related to Charlier \u2019s mental \nfunctioning simply because the ALJ found at step two that she had \n\u201cmild\u201d limitations with respect to the four broad mental domains \ndescribed in the Paragraph B criteria.   To be sure, there are decisions \nfrom some district courts (including some district courts in this Circuit) that appear to suggest the opposite: that is, if t he ALJ finds \na non- severe, mild mental limitation at step two, then the ALJ is \nrequired to include in the RFC at step four a limitation directed to \nmental functioning.\n20 \n \n16 (R. 22- 23.)   \n \n17 (See D.I. 28 at 5 (\u201cThe ALJ specifically determined that Charlier  had \u2018mild\u2019 limitations \nrelated to her depression.  He was required to include them in his RFC finding or his determination is flawed. \u201d).) \n \n18 Hess v. Comm \u2019r Soc. Sec., 931 F.3d 198, 209 (3d Cir. 2019) (citing SSR 96 -8p, 61 Fed. \nReg. 34474, 34476 (July 2, 1996) ).  \n  \n19 Id. \n \n20 See, e.g., Snider v. Saul , No. 19- 1907- MN-SRF, 2021 WL 3090870, at *9 (D. Del. July \n22, 2021)  (remanding where the ALJ found \u201c mild\u201d limitations in the four Paragraph B categories \nat step two  but failed to include mental limitations in the RFC) , report and recommendation \n 8 \n  \nBut the Third Circuit has never imposed such a categorical \nrule.  And, while it is true that the ALJ is required to consider all of the claimant \u2019s limitations when formulating the RFC, Charlier has \npointed to nothing in the regulations that would require a  limitation \nto be included in the RFC if the ALJ found at step four  that the \nlimitation would not affect a claimant\u2019 s ability to work.  As one \ncourt put it, \u201c [t]here is nothing inherently illogical about \nacknowledging a claimant \u2019s mild and non- disabling limitations \nfrom the [step two ] viewpoint, but then concluding that these \nlimitations do not restrict what a claimant can do at work .\u201d\n21  Many \nother courts have concluded the same.22 \n While it is possible that an ALJ \u2019s failure to consider a \nclaimant \u2019s non- severe mental impairment at step four  may constitute \nreversible error where the ALJ completely fails to consider limitations stemming from that non -severe impairment, that is not \nthe case here.  It is clear that the ALJ considered evidence of \nCharlier \u2019s impa irment of depression at step four , and he said enough \nto demonstrate that he complied with his duty to consider whether \nCharlier \u2019s non- severe depression resulted in any additional \nlimitations that should have been accounted for in the RFC. \n \n \nadopted sub nom.
