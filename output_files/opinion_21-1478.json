Andrews", "date": "07-26-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSAN ROCCO THERAPEUTICS , LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBLUEBIRD BIO, INC. and THIRD ROCK \nVENTURES, LLC, \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM C.A. No. 21-1478-RGA \nBefore me is Defendants ' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs second amended complaint \nbecause oflack of standing and because of Plaintiffs waiver ofright to sue. (D.I. 44). In the \nalternative, Defendants move to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. (D.I. 44). Plaintiff filed \na cross motion to join Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (\"MSK\") in the event that the \nCourt finds that MSK is a necessary party to this case. (D.I. 55). I have considered the parties' \nbriefing. (D.I. 45, 56, 63, 66, 71, 72, 73). \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff San Rocco Therapeutics (\"SRT\") is a biopharmaceutical company that develops \nrecombinant vectors used in gene therapies for the severe genetic diseases Beta Thalassemia and \nSickle Cell. (D.1. 39 at ,r,r 3-7; D.I. 45 at 4). Defendant bluebird is a biotechnology company that \nalso develops gene therapies involving recombinant vectors. (D.I. 39 at ,r 8; D.I. 45 at 4). \nDefendant Third Rock Ventures is a venture capital firm and a past shareholder of bluebird. (D.I. \n39 at ,r 9; D.I. 45 at 4). \n1 This litigation involves two patents-in-suit , U.S. Patent Nos. 7,541,179 and 8,058,061. \nMSK is the assignee of the patents-in-suit. (D.I. 39 at ,r,r14, 16; D.I. 45 at 1 n.1). In a 2005 \nExclusive License Agreement (the \"2005 Agreement \"), MSK (through its affiliate Sloan\u00ad\nKettering Institute for Cancer Research (\"SKI\")) granted to SRT an \"exclusive worldwide right \nand license\" to \"commercially develop\" a drug practicing the patents-in-suit. (D.I. 45-1, Ex. A at \n\u00a7 2.1). The 2005 Agreement was terminated in 2011. (D.1. 45-1, Ex.Bat 1). \nIn 2017, SRT sued bluebird and SKI in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in \nan action captioned Errant Gene Therapeutics, LLC v. Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer \nResearch, No. 150865/2017 (the \"New York Litigation \"). In 2019, SRT sued Third Rock and an \nindividual defendant in the Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , in an action \ncaptioned Errant Gene Therapeutics , LLC v. Third Rock Ventures, LLC, No. 19-1832 (the \n\"Massachusetts Litigation\") . A trial commenced in the New York Litigation on October 29, \n2020. On November 2, 2020, prior to the conclusion of the trial, SRT, MSK/SKI , and bluebird \nentered into the Confidential Settlement Agreement (\"2020 Agreement \"). (D.I. 45-1, Ex.Cat 1). \nThe 2020 Agreement settled both the New York Litigation and the Massachusetts Litigation . \n(D.I. 45-1, Ex.Cat 1). \nThe 2020 Agreement contains a license provision , which states in relevant part: \nTo resolve any and all disputes between the Parties related to the Dispute, MSK shall: \na. Give EGT [SRT] an exclusive , royalty-free commercial license to the intellectual \nproperty licensed in the 2005 Agreement; \n[e].1 MSK agrees to give give [sic] EGT [SRT] an exclusive , royalty-free commercial \nlicense to any intellectual property, whether owned in whole by MSK or jointly with any \nother party, or licensed to MSK, to the extent MSK has the rights to do so, and for which \ndeveloping making, having made, using, importing , selling or offering to sell the \n1 Due to an error, the 2020 Agreement labels this item \"a.\" Following the parties, the Court refers \nto this provision as \"2.[e].\" \n2 TNS9.3.55 vector or any modified or related lentiviral vector would be or could be \ninfringed. \n(D.I. 45-1, Ex.Cat 2). The parties propose opposing interpretations of the grant of an \"exclusive, \nroyalty-free commercial license\" in paragraphs 2.a and 2.[e]. Plaintiff maintains that 2.a of the \n2020 Agreement gave Plaintiff an \"exclusive (worldwide) commercial license,\" which includes \n\"the right to exclude others from making, having made, using, importing , selling, or offering for \nsale in the United States any lentiviral vector, gene therapy treatment , or drug product that is \ncovered by a valid claim of the Patents-in-Suit , which are the intellectual property licensed in the \n2005 Agreement. \" (D .I. 3 9 at ,r,r 18-20). Defendants reject these arguments as \"without any \nsupport.\" (D.I. 45 at 10-11 ). Defendants deny that the 2020 Agreement grants Plaintiff any right \nto exclude others from practicing the patents-in-suit , to enforce the patents against infringers , or \nto sublicense the patents. (D.I. 45 at 10-11). Defendants argue that once Plaintiffs patent rights \nare properly identified, Plaintiff will lack constitutional and statutory standing to sue. (D.I. 45 at \n9-13). Consequently , Defendants move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(l) for lack of constitutional \nstanding and under Rule 12(b)(6) for lack of statutory standing. (D.I. 44; D.I. 45 at 9, 12-13). \nThe 2020 Agreement contains a release provision , which states in relevant part: \nThe Parties exchange mutual general releases which shall include, without limitation , all \nclaims, both at law and in equity, accrued or unaccrued , known or unknown , suspected or \nunsuspected that relate to or arise out of (i) the 2005 Agreement , (ii) the 2011 Agreement , \n(iii) the Dispute, (iv) the actions of any of the Parties or any Affiliate of any Party leading \nto the execution of the 2005 Agreement or the 2011 Agreement[.] ... \nEGT [SRT] and [related entities] ... fully, finally and forever release, relinquish , acquit \nand discharge MSK and all of MSK's past and present partners and associates , principals , \nshareholders , members , directors, officers, representatives , predecessors , successors , \npartnerships , corporations , heirs, executors, administrators , assigns, insurers, reinsurers , \nemployees and attorneys ( collectively the \"MSK Releasees \") from and against any and \nall claims, causes of action, demands, disputes, suits, debts, dues, liabilities , ... or any \nother theory of recovery, in law, admiralty or equity, whether known or unknown, \nsuspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted , foreseen or unforeseen, that [SR T] may \nhave, ever had or now has against the MSK Releasees or any of them, for upon or by \n3 reason of any cause or thing, from the beginning of the world to the Parties' execution of \nthis Confidential Settlement Agreement. \n(D.I. 45-1, Ex.Cat ,r 5). The parties disagree about the scope of this release. Defendants claim \nthat bluebird was developing treatments using the BB305 vector prior to and as of the 2020 \nAgreement. (D.I. 45 at 16-17). They claim that SRT had \"clear knowledge \" at the time of the \n2020 Agreement that bluebird was \"developing its gene therapy treatments using a lentiviral \nvector,\" and thus that the BB305 vector was a \"cause or thing\" existing prior to the agreement \n(D.I. 45 at 17-18). Consequently, Defendants argue, SRT waived its right to sue bluebird for \ninfringement relating to the BB305 vector. (Id.). Defendants also argue that Third Rock is \nreleased from liability. (D.I. 45 at 18 n.13.). Plaintiff disagrees , arguing that the release provision \nis not applicable to its claims. (D.I. 56 at 18-20). Plaintiff disagrees with Defendants both on the \ntiming of bluebird's use of the BB305 vector and on the construal of the release provision. (D.I. \n56 at 19-21 ). Finally, MSK, which Plaintiff moves to join as a plaintiff to this action, maintains \nthat Plaintiff has waived the very claims against Defendants that Plaintiff is asserting. (D.I. 45-1, \nEx.Fat 1). \nThe 2020 Agreement contains an arbitration clause, which states in relevant part: \nThe Parties [SRT, MSK, and bluebird] shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve any \ndispute concerning this Confidential Settlement Agreement , its construction , or its actual \nor alleged breach, by face-to-face negotiations between senior executives . Should such \nnegotiation fail to resolve the matter, as defined by either party sending written notice to \nthe other party of an impasse after at least one face-to-face negotiation meeting among \nsenior executives of the parties, the matter shall be finally decided by David Ichel of X\u00ad\nDispute, LLC or, if Mr. Ichel is not available, three (3) neutral arbitrators (the \"Tribunal\") \nseated in New York, New York under the AAA Arbitration Rules (the \"Rules\"). \n(D.I. 45-1, Ex. C, ,r 7). Defendants argue that the disputes regarding the license provision and the \nrelease provision should be sent to arbitration if the Court does not dismiss the case. (D.I. 45 at \n4 19-20). Plaintiff argues that these disputes are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement. \n(D.1. 56 at 22-25). \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Rule 12(b)(l) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 1) permits the dismissal of an action for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. A Rule 12(b)(l) motion may be treated as either a facial or factual \nchallenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 346 \n(3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack contests the sufficiency of the pleadings, whereas a factual attack \ncontests the sufficiency of jurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800 \nF.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the court accepts the plaintiffs \nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences from those \nallegations in the plaintiffs favor. See In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach Litig., \n846 F.3d 625,633 (3d Cir. 2017). When reviewing a factual attack, the court may weigh and \nconsider evidence outside the pleadings. See Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d 169, \n176 (3d Cir. 2000). The party asserting subject matter jurisdiction bears \"the burden of proof that \njurisdiction does in fact exist.\" Id. \nDefendants move to dismiss this case under Rule 12(b)(l) for lack of constitutional \nstanding. (D.1. 44). Constitutional standing to sue is a threshold requirement in every federal \ncase. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). \"[T]he touchstone of constitutional standing in a \npatent infringement suit is whether a party can establish that it has an exclusionary right to suffer \nlegal injury.\" WiAVSols. LLCv. Motorola, Inc., 631 F.3d 1257, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The \nPatent Act \"does not limit the right to sue to only patent owners and assignees\" and those with \n\"all substantial rights in the patent,\" but extends the right to sue to an \"exclusive licensee.\" Id. at \n5 1264. \"To be an exclusive licensee for standing purposes, a party must have received, not only \nthe right to practice the invention within a given territory, but also the patentee's express or \nimplied promise that others shall be excluded from practicing the invention within that territory \nas well.\" Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co., 56 F.3d 1538, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1995). An exclusive \nlicensee with \"exclusionary rights,\" but lacking all substantial rights, \"cannot bring suit in its \nown name,\" though \"it may still bring suit along with the patentee.\" Lone Star Silicon \nInnovations LLC v. Nanya Tech. Corp. USA, 925 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citation \nomitted). In contrast, \"without granting [licensee] the right to enforce the patent, either explicitly \nor impliedly, the document conveys no more than a bare license\" that does not entitle the \nlicensee to bring suit, even if the patentee joins. Fieldturf, Inc. v. Sw. Recreational Indus., Inc., \n357 F.3d 1266, 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2004). A defendant may move to dismiss suits for lack of \nconstitutional standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(l). Lone Star, 925 F.3d at 1235. \nB. Rule 12(b)(6) \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the Court must accept the complaint's factual allegations as true. See Bell At!. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not \nhave to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, conclusions, or a \"formulaic \nrecitation\" of the claim elements. Id. Moreover, there must be sufficient factual matter to state a \nfacially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nDefendants move to dismiss this case under Rule 12(b )( 6) for lack of statutory standing. \n(D.I. 44; D.I. 45 at 12-13). Only a \"patentee\" or one of the \"successors in title\" may bring a \npatent infringement suit in their own name. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 281. A party to a licensing agreement \n6 has statutory standing if \"the agreement transferred all substantial rights to the patents\" to the \nparty. Lone Star, 925 F.3d at 1229. Unless it shows that it possesses all substantial rights, a party \n\"cannot bring suit in its own name.\" Id. A defendant may move to dismiss such suits under Rule \n12(b)(6). Lone Star, 925 F.3d at 1235. However, an exclusive licensee who lacks statutory \nstanding may, in certain cases, join the patentee or successor in title as an involuntary plaintiff. \nAbbott Lab ys v. Diamedix Corp., 47 F.3d 1128, 1133 (Fed. Cir. 1995). \nC. Federal Arbitration Act \nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") mandates enforcement of valid, written arbitration \nprovisions. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; Cir. City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 111 (2001). To \ndetermine whether a party agreed to submit a dispute to arbitration, a court must consider \"(1) \nwhether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties and, if so, (2) whether the \nmerits-based dispute in question falls within the scope of that valid agreement.\" Century Indem. \nCo. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 584 F.3d 513, 527 (3d Cir. 2009); see also \nFlintkote Co. v. Aviva PLC, 769 F.3d 215,220 (3d Cir. 2014). If a district court is satisfied that \nthe issue in dispute should go to arbitration based on an arbitration agreement, then the court \nmust submit the issue to arbitration upon motion by one of the parties. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. \nUnder the FAA, a court should generally resolve doubts as to the scope of an arbitration \nclause in favor of arbitration. Moses H Cone Mem 'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, \n24-25 ( 1983 ). This policy favoring arbitration stops short of favoring arbitration of arbitrability . \n\"It is presumed that courts must decide questions of arbitrability unless the parties clearly and \nunmistakably provide otherwise .... The burden of overcoming the presumption is onerous, as it \nrequires express contractual language unambiguously delegating the question of arbitrability to \nthe arbitrator.\" Opalinski v. Robert Half Int'/, Inc., 761 F.3d 326, 335 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal \n7 quotations marks and citation omitted); see also First Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. \n938, 944 (1995). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nDefendants request that the Court compel arbitration in the alternative to dismissing this \ncase. (D.I. 44, D.I. 45 at 3). If any issues in this dispute are arbitrable, the Court must submit \nthose issues to arbitration, and the Court must not decide them. The issues in dispute here \nimplicate both alternatives in Defendants ' motion, i.e., whether they provide a basis for dismissal \nand whether the parties agreed to arbitrate them. For this reason, the Court will address the \narbitrability issue fust. \nThe first round of briefing disclosed the course of related litigation in New York based on \nthe 2020 Agreement. See San Rocco Therapeutics, LLC v. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer \nCenter, Case No. 21-cv-08206 (S.D.N.Y. filed Oct. 5, 2021) (D.I. 36). In that case, Defendant \nargues that the question of arbitrability was delegated to the arbitrator. But Defendants in this \ncase had not argued that. The Court asked the parties to address that question. (D.I. 70). Plaintiff \nmaintains that the Court should decide the issue of arbitrability, and Plaintiff argues that \nDefendants have waived argument on the issue. (D.I. 56 at 22; D.I. 72 at 1-2). The Court agrees \nthat Defendants have waived argument on the issue by not raising it in their opening brief. See \nLaborers' Int'! Union v. Foster Wheeler Corp., 26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir. 1994). Defendants \nhave not disputed Plaintiffs assertion that Defendants have waived their right to raise the issue. \n(D.I. 63 at 14-15; D.I. 71 at 1-3). The Court need not launch its own inquiry into the question, \nbut may rely on the parties' own posture on the issue.2 See CardioNet, Inc. v. Cigna Health \n2 Defendants' opening brief makes no argument regarding who decides arbitrability. (See D.I. 45 \nat 19-20). They asked the Court to do that. Thus, that is the waiver. After the Court raised the \nissue, Defendants maintain that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability (D.I. 71 at 3). However , \n8 Corp., 751 F.3d 165, 171-72 (3d Cir. 2014) (holding that, because parties did not raise it on \nappeal, the issue of who decides arbitrability need not be reviewed sua sponte ); Gov 't Emps. Ins. \nCo. v. Stelton Radiology Corp., 2022 WL 1486116, at *4 (D.N.J. May 11, 2022) (\"No party \nhaving contended otherwise, I assume without further analysis that the Agreement leaves the \nquestion of arbitrability to judicial determination.\"). For these reasons, the Court will assume that \nit has the authority to decide the issue of arbitrability. \nThe parties do not dispute that the 2020 Agreement contains a valid arbitration clause. \nThe parties dispute the scope of the arbitration clause in the 2020 Agreement. Defendants argue \nthat the present disputes regarding the license and release provisions are arbitrable. (D.I. 45-1 at \n19-20; 63 at 14-15). Plaintiff denies this, arguing that the present dispute is outside the scope of \nthe arbitration clause. (D.I. 56 at 22-25). \nThe arbitration clause expressly states that \"any dispute concerning this Confidential \nSettlement Agreement, its construction, or its actual or alleged breach ... shall be finally decided \nby\" an arbitrator. (D.I. 45-1, Ex. C,, 7). Here, there is a genuine dispute about the construction \nof the license and release provisions . First, the parties disagree on what the \"exclusive, royalty\u00ad\nfree commercial license\" means. Plaintiff asserts, and Defendants deny, that Plaintiff was \ngranted a license with exclusionary rights and not merely a bare license. Whether Plaintiff has \nconstitutional standing depends on which interpretation is right. Plaintiff asserts, and Defendants \ndeny, that the license provision transferred all substantial rights in the patents-in-suit to Plaintiff. \nat the same time, Defendants recognize that the application of the AAA rules \"arguably is \nconditional\" -applicable only if the preferred arbitrator (Mr. Ichel) is unavailable . (Id.). \nDefendants perhaps assume that an arbitrator is not required to decide arbitrability, because they \nargue that, \"in the first instance,\" the Court has the authority to dismiss this case based on the \nCourt's own construction of the 2020 Agreement, without first submitting the arbitrability issue \nto an arbitrator. (Id.). \n9 Whether Plaintiff has statutory standing depends on which interpretation is right. Second, \nDefendants assert, and Plaintiff denies, that Plaintiff waived its right to bring this infringement \nsuit in the 2020 Agreement. This disagreement turns on the construction of the release provision \nbecause the parties accuse each other of \"misreading\" (D.I. 66 at 2) or \"mischaracteriz[ing] the \nlanguage of' (D.I. 63 at 9) the release provision. Whose interpretation of the contract is right on \nthese issues? Since the 2020 Agreement committed questions regarding contract construction to \nthe arbitrator, it is for the arbitrator, not the Court, to say. Because it falls within the scope of a \nvalid arbitration agreement, these interpretive disagreements must be submitted to arbitration. \nFor the same reason, the Court cannot grant a motion to dismiss that depends on the resolution of \nan arbitrable dispute. \nPlaintiff objects that disputes regarding the license and release provisions are not \narbitrable because the arbitration clause is \"narrow.\" (D.I. 56 at 22-23). But even assuming for \nthe sake of argument that the clause does not submit to arbitration \"all disputes and controversies \nof every kind and nature\" arising out of the agreement, see Griswold v. Coventry First LLC, 762 \nF.3d 264,271 n.5 (3d Cir. 2014), the present dispute falls squarely within the narrow category of \na dispute regarding \"construction\" of the 2020 Agreement. Plaintiff does not address this point. \nFor at least this reason, Plaintiffs argument fails. \nPlaintiff also argues that the Court, not an arbitrator, must determine standing. (D.I. 56 at \n25). This observation is true but irrelevant. The arbitrator here is called on to interpret a contract, \nnot to determine standing. The Court may consider the arbitrator's findings because the court \nmay \"consider evidence outside the pleadings\" in its evaluation of a factual attack under Rule \n12(b)(l). See Gould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d at 176. \"In determining whether a \nmotion to dismiss should be granted,\" the Court \"may find it necessary to inquire into \n10 jurisdictional facts that are disputed.\" See Rocovich v. United States, 933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed. \nCir. 1991 ). And because a proper interpretation of the license provision is also required for \ndetermining whether the Plaintiff received all substantial rights to the patents-in-suit, the \narbitrator's determination is also required for determining whether Plaintiff has statutory \nstanding, and thus whether to grant Defendants' Rule 12(b )( 6) motion to dismiss. \nPlaintiff cites two cases in favor of denying arbitration. (D.I. 56 at 25). Both cases are \ninapposite . First, though \"[ w ]hether a plaintiff has standing to sue is a matter of law to be \ndetermined by the court,\" EMC Corp. v. Pure Storage, Inc., 165 F. Supp. 3d 170, 174 (D. Del. \n2016), the question submitted to the arbitrator here is a threshold issue related to standing, not \nthe standing question itself. Second, a district court cannot compel arbitration on the substance of \na plaintiffs patent infringement claim if a plaintiff lacks standing. Golden Eagle USA, LLC v. \nConsol. Indus. Corp., 161 F. App'x 949, 950 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Here, unlike in Golden Eagle, I \nam not forgoing or overlooking the standing inquiry, but compelling arbitration as part of it. And \nat least at this stage, I am not compelling arbitration of Plaintiffs patent infringement claims. \nFor the above reasons, I will stay the case pending resolution of the threshold interpretive \ndisputes pertaining to the license and release provisions . Defendants seek dismissal based on \ntheir proposed interpretation of the licensing and release provisions in the 2020 Agreement. (D.I. \n45 at 9-19). Because I have provided no construction of those provisions, I will deny \nDefendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice. Similarly, because Plaintiff's cross-motion to \njoin the patent owner depends on a particular interpretation of the 2020 Agreement, I will deny \nPlaintiffs motion without prejudice. \n11 IV. CONCLUSION \nI will grant in part Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Proceedings. \n(D.1. 44). I will stay the case pending the determination of an arbitrator regarding interpretation \nof the license and release provisions. I will deny without prejudice Defendants ' request to \ndismiss this case. I will also deny without prejudice Plaintiffs Cross-Motion to Join the Patent \nOwner Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19 and Amend the Complaint. (D.I. 55). \n12 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSAN ROCCO THERAPEUTICS, LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBLUEBIRD BIO, INC. and THIRD ROCK \nVENTURES, LLC, \nDefendants . \nORDER C.A.
