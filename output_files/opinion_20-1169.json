Shore (\u201cShore\u201d) filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) on\nApril 28, 2016 against the defendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting Commissioner of the Social\nSecurity Administration (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d). (D.I. 1) Shore seeks judicial review of the\nCommissioner\u2019s May 23, 2019 final decision denying Shore\u2019s claim for disability insurance\nbenefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433.\nCurrently before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Shore and the\nCommissioner.\u2019 (D.I. 17; D.I. 21) For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the court\nDENY Shore\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 17), and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment (D.I. 21).\n\n' Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 The parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge to conduct all proceedings in this\nmatter through final judgment, and the case was assigned to the undersigned judicial officer on\nMarch 25, 2021. (D.I. 15)\n\n3 The briefing on the pending motions is found at D.I. 18 and D.I. 22. Ina notice filed on July 9,\n2021, Shore indicated her intention to rest on her opening brief. (D.I. 23)\nL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nShore protectively filed an application for DIB in April 2016, alleging a disability onset\ndate of December 28, 2014 due to cervical stenosis, cervical radiculopathy, bilateral carpal\ntunnel syndrome, bilateral rheumatoid arthritis in the upper extremities, and ocular migraines.\n(DLL. 11 at 237-38, 265) Shore\u2019s claim was denied initially and upon reconsideration. (/d. at\n153-56, 162-66)\n\nAt Shore\u2019s request, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on March 7,\n2019. (id. at 81-116) The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on May 23, 2019, finding that\nShore was capable of a reduced range of light work and could perform her past relevant work.\n(Ud. at 56-68) The Appeals Council subsequently denied Shore\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. (Jd. at 10-13)\n\nShore brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on September 2, 2020.\n(D.I. 1) Shore filed her pending motion for summary judgment on April 28, 2021 (D.I. 17), and\nthe Commissioner filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on July 1, 2021 (D.I. 21).\nBriefing is now complete on the pending motions.\n\nB. Medical History\n\nThe ALJ found that Shore had the following severe impairments: bilateral carpal tunnel\nsyndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine, and obesity.\n(D.I. 11 at 59) Shore challenges the ALJ\u2019s assessment of certain treating specialists\u2019 opinions\nand her credibility. (D.I. 18 at 13-23) The court\u2019s consideration of Shore\u2019s medical history is\n\nfocused on evidence relevant to those discrete issues.\n1. Medical evidence\n\nShore began experiencing neck and arm pain after being involved in an auto accident in\nDecember 2003. (D.I. 11 at 376; D.I. 12 at 46, 62) At the time, she treated with two\nneurologists and underwent three months of physical therapy. (D.I. 12 at 62) She also reduced\nher work schedule to no more than six hours per shift. (/d.; D.J. 11 at 376) In 2011, she returned\nto full-time work of eight- to ten-hour shifts. (/d.) Due to her worsening symptoms, however,\nshe sought a leave of absence in December 2014.4 (D.I. 12 at 63; D.I. 11 at 376) At her\nemployer\u2019s request, she worked several extra days unti] December 28, 2014. (D.I. 11 at 85-86)\n\nPhysical therapy notes from March 2015 indicate that conservative therapy was effective\nin addressing Shore\u2019s neck pain, resulting in increased range of motion and strength in her upper\nextremities. (D.I. 13 at 171) On April 7, 2015, Shore underwent a nerve conduction study and\nelectromyography (\u201cEMG\u201d) performed by Sandra Maguire, M.D. (D.I. 12 at 332-35) The\nresults showed only mild abnormalities and no electrophysiological evidence of cervical motor\nradiculopathy in Shore\u2019s upper extremities. (Jd. at 335)\n\nAn MRI of Shore\u2019s cervical spine in May 2015 showed a C5-C6 disc protrusion, mild\ncentral narrowing, and no significant foraminal narrowing. (D.I. 12 at 39-40, 47, 429) Shore\u2019s\nprimary care physician, James P. Douglas-Steele, M.D., noted diffuse tenderness and weakness\nin the upper extremities that improved slowly with physical therapy, and he referred Shore for\npossible spinal injections. (/d. at 429-30) Subsequent trigger point injections administered by\nJoel S. Golden, M.D., a pain management specialist, provided no relief of her neck and bilateral\n\narm symptoms. (/d. at 47, 347, 427-28) Accordingly, Dr. Douglas-Steele and Dr. Golden\n\n4 The ALJ determined that Shore engaged in substantial gainful activity for the fiscal year 2015\nbased on her earnings report, which showed earnings of $27,002.01 in 2015. (D.I. 11 at 59, 62,\n250) Shore does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s finding on this point.\n\n3\nrecommended a cervical epidural steroid injection. (/d. at 347, 426) Shore declined the injection\nbecause she was unable to afford the copay. (Id. at 347)\n\nDr. Douglas-Steele\u2019s treatment notes and Shore\u2019s physical therapy records from this time\nperiod also describe Shore\u2019s hand weakness and diminished fine motor control. In May 2015,\nDr. Douglas-Steele indicated that Shore\u2019s grip and arm strength were improving and suggested\nthat she continue with physical therapy. (D.I. 12 at 431-32) In July, he noted diminished grip\nstrength on the right side but explained that there was \u201cno clear muscle atrophy in the right\nhand.\u201d (Id. at 425) Shore\u2019s physical therapy notes from July to November 2015 confirmed that\nShore had grip / pinch strength of ten pounds on the right side and fifteen on the left. (/d. at 190,\n254) Continued physical therapy visits yielded increased range of motion in Shore\u2019s cervical\nspine and mild improvement in her carpal mobility, although Shore still exhibited limited\nendurance with fine motor skills and neck strength. (/d. at 238, 241)\n\nBy September 2015, Dr. Douglas-Steele described decreased grip strength in both hands\nand decreased bilateral upper extremity strength. (Jd. at 424) A physical examination in\nconnection with her EMG that month revealed full strength and intact sensation in the bilateral\nupper extremities, and it was noted that Shore exhibited \u201can unusual constellation of symptoms\u201d\nthat did not neatly fit a diagnosis of carpal tunnel or cervical myelopathy. (/d. at 76) It was also\ndetermined that Shore\u2019s C5-C6 disc protrusion was not likely the cause of her symptoms. (/d. at\n77) A brachial plexus MRI performed in October 2015 was \u201c[uJnremarkable . . . without\nabnormal signal, enhancement or extrinsic compression lesion,\u201d and wrist x-rays taken in\nNovember 2015 revealed normal images of the right wrist and small cystic changes in the left\n\nwrist. (Id. at 337, 355) Shore demonstrated limited progress in improving her hand strength\nduring the ensuing months of physical therapy, but she did experience improvement in cervical\nstrength and range of motion by November 2015. (/d. at 191)\n\nShore underwent an EMG of her hands and wrists in January 2016 that revealed mild\nbilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and night splints were recommended for symptomatic relief.\n(D.I. 12 at 318) A May 2016 MRI of Shore\u2019s cervical spine showed an \u201cunremarkable study\u201d\napart from a small cyst. (D.I. 13 at 101) In September 2016, Shore visited the emergency room\nfor right arm and elbow pain. (Jd. at 156) She was discharged with instructions to take anti-\ninflammatory steroid medication. (/d. at 157)\n\nShore began treating with neurosurgeon Matthew J. Eppley, M.D., on November 1, 2016.\n(D.L. 12 at 482-84) Dr. Eppley observed Shore\u2019s trouble with her right-hand function, but his\nexamination revealed no obvious atrophy, no obvious myelopathy, and good grip strength. Ud.\nat 483-84) He discussed surgical options to address her neck pain but \u201coffer[ed] her no\nguarantees that surgery will be helpful\u201d because the location of her neck pain was \u201c[u]nproven\nby EMG.\u201d (/d. at 484) Dr. Eppley recommended cervical spine injections, but Plaintiff rejected\nthe recommendation and requested noninvasive treatment options. (/d.)\n\nAfter receiving cervical epidural steroid injections between November 2016 and July\n2017, Shore experienced improved range of motion, reduced pain, and 4/5 grip strength in her\nright hand. (D.I. 12 at 475-79; D.L. 13 at 46-47) By July 2017, Shore\u2019s treatment notes indicate\nthat her pain not only improved after the facet block injections, but also that \u201c[t]he pain has not\nreturned.\u201d (D.I. 13 at 47) Although Shore complained that she continued to experience\nweakness, numbness, and tingling in her upper extremities, she maintained that she did not wish\n\nto pursue surgical options. (D.I. 12 at 485-86)\nShore underwent a bilateral upper extremity EMG on January 2, 2019 that showed\nnormal electrodiagnostic results, with no evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome, nerve entrapment,\ncervical radiculopathy, or brachial plexopathy. (D.I. 13 at 103)\n\n2. Medical opinions\n\nIn July 2015, three of Shore\u2019s medical providers issued opinions regarding Shore\u2019s\nmedical condition, her functional limitations, and her ability to work. (D.I. 13 at 173-75) These\nopinions, from Dr. Douglas-Steele, Dr. Golden, and Dr. Maguire, confirm that Shore has a disc\nprotrusion in her cervical spine as well as numbness and stiffness in her hands. (/d.) Shore\u2019s\ntreating physicians summarize the self-reported effects of these conditions, including difficulty\nholding a pen, writing, operating a computer, opening pill bottles, and sitting or standing without\nneck support and frequent changes of position. (/d.) The opinions indicate that Shore continues\nher treatment with a physiatrist, but she was instructed not to use a neck brace and she rejected a\nrecommendation for cervical epidural steroid injections. (/d.) Two of the three opinions\nconclude that Shore cannot work as a pharmacist due to her condition. (/d.)\n\nOn August 4, 2015, physical therapist Jillian Greim opined that Shore could not lift more\nthan five pounds with her right hand, had difficulty reaching and turning objects, could not hold\nobjects for an extended period without dropping them, and could not hold her head up during\nseated activities. (D.I. 12 at 336) Ms. Greim based these conclusions on observations made\nduring a total of four skilled physical therapy visits. (/d.)\n\nSix months later, physical therapist Carina Rodriguez completed a functional capacity\nevaluation (\u201cFCE\u201d) regarding Shore\u2019s condition at Dr. Douglas-Steele\u2019s request. (D.I. 12 at 106-\n10) After administering a series of tests, Ms. Rodriguez concluded that Shore was limited to\n\nwork at the sedentary level for no more than four hours per day, lifting up to ten pounds on an\noccasional basis. (/d.) Ms. Rodriguez identified significant deficits in Shore\u2019s range of motion\nin her cervical spine and bilateral upper extremities, which translated into an inability to perform\nthe repetitive motions necessary to complete tasks in her job as a pharmacist. (/d. at 109)\n\nOn June 8, 2017, state agency medical consultant Michael H. Borek, D.O. evaluated\nShore\u2019s records, opining that her condition had not significantly deteriorated, and she would still\nbe capable of performing light work. (D.I. 11 at 143) Dr. Borek acknowledged that Shore had\nbilateral weakness in her wrists and disc herniation in her cervical spine, but he emphasized her\nindependence in her activities of daily living and her pursuit of conservative treatment rather\nthan surgery. (/d.)\n\nShore\u2019s counsel referred her to physical therapist Jeff Vari, who provided a FCE on\nOctober 12, 2018. (D.I. 13 at 34-44) Mr. Vari concluded that Shore could work less than two\nhours per day at a sedentary level of exertion due to significant limitations in her bilateral upper\nextremities, including a functional grip deficit and a loss of manual dexterity. (/d. at 35, 40)\n\nOn January 15, 2019, Dr. Eppley evaluated Shore for a review of Mr. Vari\u2019s FCE. (D.I.\n13 at 176-78) Dr. Eppley concurred with the conclusions in Mr. Vari\u2019s evaluation, but he noted\nShore\u2019s negative EMG results and indicated she continued to decline surgical intervention as a\ntreatment option. (/d. at 176-77) His examination confirmed that Shore had full strength in her\nbilateral upper extremities, some tendemess in her neck, and no difficulties with standing or\nwalking. (/d. at 177)\n\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n\n1. Shore\u2019s Testimony\nDuring the hearing before the ALJ, Shore testified that she had to stop working in\n\nDecember 2014 after 26 years as a pharmacist. (D.I. 11 at 100-01) Shore explained that she lost\nstrength in her hands and began experiencing pain in her neck after an auto accident in 2003, and\nher condition has worsened since that time. (/d. at 88-94) She described how she experiences\nconstant numbness and pins and needles sensations in her hands, with limited fine motor skills\nand strength that prevents her from lifting or carrying more than two pounds with each hand.\n\n(Id. at 92) Repetitive motions, such as holding her phone or using a computer keyboard, cause\nher hands to freeze up. (/d. at 93) Holding her head in position without support causes pain in\nher neck, and she estimated that she could sit or stand without changing position for one hour if\nher neck was supported, but only for a half hour or forty-five minutes if her neck was\nunsupported. (Id. at 93-95)\n\nIn describing how her symptoms have progressed since the auto accident in 2003, Shore\nindicated that she stopped working in December 2014 because it was too difficult to look at the\ncomputer monitor, type on the keyboard, use the phone, or write due to her hand and neck\nconditions. (D.I. 11 at 100-01) She estimated that she could no longer perform activities such as\ngardening by 2015 or 2016. (Jd. at 88-89) And she switched from standard plates to paper plates\nfor meals at home in 2018, after she nearly dropped a plate while trying to take it out of the\nmicrowave. (/d. at 103-04)\n\nWith respect to her daily activities and hobbies, Shore testified that she lives with her\nfianc\u00e9, she has a driver\u2019s license, and she can drive and run errands independently several times a\nweek. (D.I. 11 at 88-90) Beyond reading, she explained that there are not any hobbies or\nactivities she can do. (/d. at 98-99) However, she is able to take cruises to the Caribbean\n\nbiannually, and she travels to visit friends and family in Georgia and Alabama. (/d. at 90-91)\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical to vocational\nexpert (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\nNow, if you could please assume a hypothetical individual with the past jobs\n\nyou\u2019ve described. The individual has completed at least four years of college.\n\nThe individual during the period issued between the ages of \u2014 of 49 and 53 years\n\nof age. And the individual has a further level limitation to a light exertional work\n\nwith \u2014 with a further limitation to only . . . occasional pushing or pulling with the .\n\n. . upper extremities or operating hand controls with the upper extremities. You\n\nwould have to further limitation to only occasional climbing of ladders, ropes, or\n\nscaffolds. And then you would be further limited to work that involved only\n\noccasional crawling. The individual would be limited to \u2014 to work that involved\n\nonly frequent, but not continuous handling or fingering with her bilateral upper\n\nextremities. An individual would need to be able to avoid a concentrated\n\nexposure to work that has a vibration. Would an individual with these limitations\n\nbe able to do any of the past work that you described as it was done by the\n\nClaimant or as that work is generally performed in the national economy?\n(D.I. 11 at 106-07) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a\nhypothetical individual would be able to perform Shore\u2019s past work as a pharmacist, both as it\nwas actually and generally performed. (Jd. at 107) The ALJ then asked the VE if Shore\u2019s past\nwork would still be available to a hypothetical individual who was further limited to work that\ninvolved lifting or carrying of ten bounds occasionally and less than ten pounds frequently. (/d.)\nThe VE testified that such a hypothetical individual would not be able to perform Shore\u2019s past\nwork and would be precluded from performing any work at the light exertional level. (/d.)\n\nNext, the ALJ returned to the initial hypothetical and added a further limitation to work\nthat involved only occasional writing or use of a keyboard. (D.I. 11 at 107-08) The VE testified\nthat Shore\u2019s past work as a pharmacist would be precluded because it requires frequent data\nentry on acomputer. (/d. at 108) However, the VE suggested that the hypothetical individual\n\ncould perform work at the light exertional level in the roles of extrusion operator, subassembler,\n\nand sorter. (Id. at 108-09) The VE testified that off-task behavior for 10% of the workday\nwould not preclude work in those positions, but any off-task behavior exceeding that threshold\nwould be work preclusive. (/d. at 109-10) At the sedentary exertional level, an individual\nlimited to frequent handling and fingering but only occasional writing or keyboard use would be\nprecluded from working. (/d. at 109)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the medical evidence in the record and the testimony by Shore and the VE, the\nALJ determined that Shore was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period from the\nDecember 28, 2014 disability onset date through the decision date. (D.I. 11 at 56-68) The ALJ\nfound, in pertinent part:\n\n1. The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act\nthrough December 31, 2021.\n\n2. The claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity in fiscal year of 2015 (20\nCFR 404.1520(b), 404.1571 et seq.).\n\n3. The claimant has the following severe impairments: bilateral carpal tunnel\nsyndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease of the cervical\nspine, and obesity (20 CFR 404.1520(c)).\n\n4. The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that\nmeets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(d), 404.1525 and\n404.1526).\n\n5. After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the\nclaimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined\nin 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except with further limitation to only occasional\npushing and/or pulling, including the operation of hand controls with the\nupper extremities. The claimant is limited to only occasional climbing of\nladders, ropes, or scaffolds or crawling. She is also limited to only frequent,\nbut not continuous handling or fingering bilaterally. She should avoid\nconcentrated exposure to vibration.\n\n6. The claimant is capable of performing past relevant work as a Pharmacist.\n\nThis work does not require the performance of work-related activities\nprecluded by the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (20 CFR 404.1565).\n\n10\n7. Although the claimant is capable of performing past relevant work, there are\nother jobs existing in the national economy that she is also able to perform.\nTherefore, the Administrative Law Judge makes the following alternative\nfindings for step five of the sequential evaluation process.\n8. The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security\nAct, from December 28, 2014, through the date of this decision (20 CFR\n404.1520(f)).\n(D.I. 11 at 59-68)\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\nevidence supports the decision. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1148,\n1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a reasonable mind\nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 839 F.\nApp\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high{,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\nI. DISCUSSION\nA. Disability Determination Process\nTitle II of the Social Security Act \u201cprovides for the payment of insurance benefits to\npersons who have contributed to the program and who suffer from a physical or mental\ndisability.\u201d Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987). A disability is defined for purposes of\nDIB as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically\n\ndeterminable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which\n\n11\nhas lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they\npreclude a return to previous work or engagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work\nexisting in the national economy. Jd. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22\n(2003).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir. 1999). If\nthe Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the sequential\nprocess, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). At\nstep one, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in any substantial\ngainful activity. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial\ngainful activity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is\nsuffering from a severe impairment or a severe combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. When a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is presumed disabled. See\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If a claimant\u2019s impairment, either singly or in combination, fails\nto meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\n\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186\n\n12\nF.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do despite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak\ny. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal\nquotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating the inability\nto return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428.\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other words, the\nCommissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age,\neducation, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n\nShore challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision in two respects: (1) the ALJ failed to properly\nevaluate the opinions of Shore\u2019s treating and evaluating specialists; and (2) the ALJ erred in his\nassessment of Shore\u2019s credibility by failing to consider Shore\u2019s work history. (D.I. 18 at 14-23)\n\n1. Medical opinion evidence\n\nAt the time Shore submitted her claim for DIB, the Third Circuit subscribed to the\n\u201ctreating physician doctrine,\u201d which requires a treating medical source\u2019s opinion to be given\ncontrolling or substantial weight if it is \u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical and\nlaboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in\n\n[the claimant's] case record.\u201d Fargnoli v. Massanari, 247 F.3d 34, 43 (3d Cir. 2001); Mason v.\n\n13\nShalala, 994 F.2d 1058, 1067 (3d Cir. 1993); see also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2). In cases\nwhere the treating source opinion is either inconsistent with other substantial evidence or not\nwell-supported by objective medical findings, the opinion may be given less than controlling\nweight, but it should not be automatically rejected. See S.S.R. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *4\n(July 2, 1996); Gonzalez v. Astrue, 537 F. Supp. 2d 644, 660 (D. Del. 2008). Instead, the treating\nsource opinion should be afforded the appropriate amount of deference in accordance with the\nfactors listed in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527,\u00b0 which include the length of the treatment relationship,\nthe frequency of examination, the nature and extent of the treatment relationship, the\nsupportability and consistency of the opinion, and the specialization of the treating physician. 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c). The ALJ need not explicitly discuss each factor under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1527(c), so long as the ALJ\u2019s consideration of the evidence is presented clearly enough to\nallow for judicial review. See Samah v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2018 WL 6178862, at *5 (D.N.J.\nNov. 27, 2018) (quoting Laverde v. Colvin, 2015 WL 5559984, at *6 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 21, 2015)).\n\nAlthough the ALJ may make credibility determinations when the record contains\ninconsistent or conflicting evidence, the ALJ \u201ccannot reject evidence for no reason or the wrong\nreason.\u201d Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 429 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting Mason, 994 F.2d at 1066).\nAccordingly, the ALJ must provide specific reasons for the weight given to the treating source\u2019s\nmedical opinion based on the evidence in the record. S.S.R. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *5; see\nDass v. Barnhart, 386 F. Supp. 2d 568, 576 (D. Del. 2005). Otherwise, the reviewing court\ncannot judge whether \u201csignificant probative evidence was not credited or if it was simply\n\nignored.\u201d Fargnoli, 247 F.3d at 41; see Simmonds v. Astrue, 872 F. Supp. 2d 351, 358 (D. Del.\n\n5 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527 was superseded by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c for claims filed on or after\nMarch 27, 2017. Because Shore\u2019s claim was filed prior to this date, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\nremains in effect.\n\n14\n2012); Gonzalez, 537 F. Supp. 2d at 660. Importantly, the ALJ may not reject a treating\nphysician\u2019s opinion based on \u201chis or her own credibility judgments, speculation, or lay opinion.\u201d\nMorales v. Apfel, 225 F.3d 310, 317 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nShore argues that the ALJ did not give appropriate deference or consideration to a\nnumber of her treating specialists\u2019 opinions under this framework and contends that those\nopinions support greater limitations than those found by the ALJ in the RFC assessment. (D.I.\n18 at 14-18) In particular, Shore challenges the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of the opinions of Dr. Douglas-\nSteele, Dr. Golden, Dr. Maguire, Dr. Eppley, and physical therapists Jillian Greim, Carina\nRodriguez, and Jeff Vari.* (Id. at 14-21)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s assessment of the treating source opinions and evaluations is supported by\nsubstantial evidence. As a preliminary matter, the opinions of Dr. Douglas-Steele, Dr. Golden,\nand Jillian Greim from 2015 are inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s unchallenged finding that Shore was\nengaged in substantial gainful activity in 2015.\u2019 (D.I. 13 at 173-74; D.I. 12 at 336; D.I. 11 at 59,\n\n62) These opinions describe Shore\u2019s limited range of motion and reduced strength in her upper\n\n6 Shore concedes that \u201cthe ALJ was not obligated to give any particular consideration to the\nopinions of Drs. Eskander and Pirestani.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 14)\n\n7The ALJ raised the issue of Shore\u2019s post-onset date earnings during the hearing and requested\nadditional records to establish whether Shore\u2019s earnings after her onset date were derived from\nsubstantial gainful activity. (D.I. 11 at 87) Based on the earnings evidence of record, the ALJ\nexpressly ruled that \u201c[t]he claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity in fiscal year of 2015.\u201d\n(id. at 59, 62) Shore elected not to challenge the ALJ\u2019s step one finding in the briefing on her\nmotion for summary judgment. (D.I. 18) When the Commissioner favorably cited the ALJ\u2019s\nstep one ruling in support of the argument that the 2015 opinions were properly given little\nweight, Shore waived her right to respond. (D.I. 22 at 11-12; D.I. 23) Shore has therefore\nwaived any argument about the ALJ\u2019s step one determination of her 2015 earnings. See\nMaddaloni v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 340 F. App\u2019x 800, 801 n.1 (3d Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe need not\naddress [the claimant\u2019s] contention that the ALJ erred at step four because this issue was not\nraised before the District Court, and it is therefore waived.\u201d).\n\n15\nextremities and cervical spine, which translate into an alleged inability to hold a pen, open pill\nbottles, or use a computer or phone. (D.J. 13 at 173-74; D.I. 12 at 336)\n\nShore includes Dr. Maguire among the treating specialists opining that Shore is unable to\nperform her past work as a pharmacist. (D.I. 18 at 14-17) Dr. Maguire had a single appointment\nwith Shore for the purpose of conducting an EMG study on April 7, 2015. (D.I. 12 at 332-35)\nWithout any further follow-up, on July 14, 2015, Dr. Maguire wrote a letter suggesting\nmodifications to Shore\u2019s work activities.2 (D.I. 13 at 175) This occurred in the same month that\nDr. Douglas-Steele and Dr. Golden were of the opinion that Shore was totally disabled from\nworking as a pharmacist. (Jd. at 173-74) Dr. Maguire\u2019s opinion is not only contrary to the\nopinions of the other specialists, but also serves to confirm the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiff\nwas working as a pharmacist in 2015. Shore fails to address these inconsistencies in her briefing\nand is silent on their weight and impact on the ALJ\u2019s RFC.\n\nShore\u2019s earnings report from this same time period suggests that Shore was engaged in\nsubstantial gainful activity, earning more than $27,000 in 2015. (D.I. 11 at 250, 253) Under the\nregulations, a claimant who is engaged in substantial gainful activity is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4)(i). Accordingly, Shore\u2019s substantial gainful activity in 2015 supports the ALJ\u2019s\nassignment of little weight to the 2015 opinions of treating specialists concluding that Shore\u2019s\nfunctional limitations were work-preclusive.\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s assignment of little weight to the opinions of Dr. Douglas-Steele, Dr.\n\nMaguire, and Dr. Golden is also supported by Shore\u2019s activities of daily living, objective clinical\n\n8 Dr. Maguire opined that shore \u201cneeds to be able to change positions frequently for pain relief.\nShe . . . may need more frequent breaks with work activities to rest her head and neck, as often as\n5-10 minutes every hour.... She... may need assistance with opening pill bottles at work, due\nto the dexterity and strength required.\u201d (D.I. 13 at 175)\n\n16\nfindings, and conservative treatment. See Antoniolo v. Colvin, 208 F. Supp. 3d 587, 596 (D. Del.\n2016) (upholding ALJ\u2019s assignment of little weight to treating physician opinions where those\nopinions were inconsistent with objective medical evidence and conservative treatment). Dr.\nDouglas-Steele, Dr. Maguire, and Dr. Golden opined that Shore\u2019s cervical condition made it\ndifficult for her to hold a pen, write her name, work at a computer, and open pill bottles, among\nother things. (D.I. 13 at 173-75) But the ALJ noted that these conditions developed as a result\nof a 2003 auto accident, and Shore was able to perform her work duties for more than ten years\nfollowing the accident. (D.I. 11 at 62) The ALJ also discussed Shore\u2019s ability to drive and go\nshopping by herself several times per week, as well as her ability to travel internationally on a\nbiannual basis without any reported difficulties. (/d.) MRI and EMG results showed only mild\nconditions that were inconsistent with Shore\u2019s self-described symptoms. (Jd. at 62-63; D.I. 12 at\n39-40, 47, 76-77, 318, 337, 355, 429; D.I. 13 at 101, 103) And the record supports the ALJ\u2019s\nconclusion that conservative treatments, such as physical therapy and injections, were reasonably\neffective in mitigating Shore\u2019s symptoms. (D.I. 11 at 63; D.I. 12 at 47, 347, 427-28, 431-32,\n475-79, 485-86; D.I. 13 at 46-47, 171) Indeed, Dr. Golden acknowledged in his opinion that\nShore rejected cervical epidural steroid injections that were recommended to her. (D.I. 13 at\n173)\n\nTo the extent that the opinions of Dr. Golden and Dr. Douglas-Steele suggest that Shore\nis disabled and cannot work as a pharmacist, the ALJ was not obligated to assign any weight to\nthose statements because determinations of disability are reserved for the Commissioner. See\nHoyman vy. Colvin, 606 F. App\u2019x 678, 680-81 (3d Cir. 2015). Shore concedes \u201cit is accurate to\nstate that an ALJ may appropriately ignore opinions that are merely ultimate conclusions about\n\ndisability.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 20) Therefore, Shore agrees that the portions of the opinions of Dr.\n\n17\nDouglas-Steele and Dr. Golden expressing a conclusory opinion about Shore\u2019s disability are\nimproper conclusions \u201cin part.\u201d (Id.)\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s decision to assign little weight to the opinion of Dr. Eppley is also supported\nby substantial evidence. The ALJ correctly observed that Dr. Eppley had not treated Shore for\nover a year at the time he gave his opinion. (D.I. 11 at 65) The Third Circuit has recognized that\nsuch significant gaps in treatment support an ALJ\u2019s determination to assign reduced weight to a\ntreating physician\u2019s opinion because they tend to undermine the plaintiffs claims of severity.\nSee Lee v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 248 F. App\u2019x 458, 461 (3d Cir. 2007). Also, Dr. Eppley\u2019s\nopinion concurs with Mr. Vari\u2019s FCE without further medical findings that support the limitation\nthat Shore can work for less than two hours in an eight-hour workday. (D.I. 13 at 176-78) (\u201cShe\ntook another FCE which said she can work less than 2 hours. I agreed with it and signed it.\u201d).\nDr. Eppley\u2019s concurrence with the FCE is inconsistent with his acknowledgement that Shore\u2019s\n\u201cEMG is negative,\u201d his request \u201cto check an MRI of her cervical spine\u201d because no recent MRI\ndata was available to him, and his confirmation that she continued to decline surgical\nintervention or more aggressive treatment options. (/d. at 176-77) His physical examination also\nconfirmed that Shore had full strength in her bilateral upper extremities, some tenderness in her\nneck, and no difficulties with standing or walking. (/d. at 177) Consequently, substantial\nevidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to assign little weight to Dr. Eppley\u2019s wholesale adoption\nof the limitations set forth in the FCE. See Peters v. Berryhill, 2019 WL 2592623, at *4-5 (M.D.\nPa. May 28, 2019) (upholding ALJ\u2019s assignment of little weight to treating physicians\u2019 opinions\nthat concurred with the findings of an FCE which was not supported by clinical findings).\n\nThe ALJ was not required to give controlling or substantial weight to the opinions of Dr.\n\nGolden, Dr. Maguire, Dr. Douglas-Steele, and Dr. Eppley because those opinions are not well-\n\n18\nsupported by Shore\u2019s MRI and EMG results, they are inconsistent with Shore\u2019s work history in\nthe decade following the 2003 auto accident, and they are contradicted by Shore\u2019s rejection of\nmore aggressive treatment options. See Fargnoli v. Massanari, 247 F.3d 34, 43 (3d Cir. 2001);\nMason v. Shalala, 994 F.2d 1058, 1067 (3d Cir. 1993); see also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2). The\nALJ properly assigned little weight to these opinions to account for their inconsistency with the\nrecord as a whole. See S.S.R. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *4 (July 2, 1996); Gonzalez v. Astrue,\n537 F. Supp. 2d 644, 660 (D. Del. 2008).\n\nWith respect to the opinions of Ms. Greim, Ms. Rodriguez, and Mr. Vari, the ALJ\u2019s\nassignment of no weight is well-supported because physical therapists were not considered\nacceptable medical sources for claims filed before March 27, 2017. See S.S.R. 06-03p, 2006 WL\n2329939, at *2 (Aug. 9, 2006); Hatton v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 131 F. App\u2019x 877, 878\n(3d Cir. 2005) (\u201cStatements from a physical therapist are entitled to consideration as additional\nevidence, but are not entitled to controlling weight\u201d because \u201cthe rules for evaluating acceptable\nmedical source statements do not apply\u201d to a physical therapist\u2019s opinion or FCE). Shore does\nnot dispute this designation. (D.I. 18 at 18) For the reasons previously discussed, these opinions\nand evaluations are inconsistent with Shore\u2019s activities of daily living, objective clinical findings,\nand pursuit of conservative treatment. Factors weighed in considering evidence from\nnonacceptable medical sources, such as the length and frequency of the treatment relationship,\nfurther support the ALJ\u2019s assignment of no weight. See S.S.R. 06-03p, 2006 WL 2329939, at *2.\nThe record confirms that Shore had only a consultative relationship with Ms. Rodriguez and Mr.\nVari for purposes of obtaining FCEs. (D.I. 12 at 106-10; D.I. 13 at 34-44) Likewise, Shore\u2019s\n\ntreatment with Ms. Greim was limited to a total of four visits over the course of one month at the\n\n19\ntime Ms. Greim rendered her opinion. (D.I. 12 at 336) Substantial evidence therefore supports\nthe ALJ\u2019s decision to assign no weight to the opinions of the physical therapists.\n2. Credibility assessment\n\nShore also contends that the ALJ\u2019s credibility assessment of her self-described limitations\nis defective because the ALJ did not consider Shore\u2019s strong work history. (D.L. 18 at 21-23) In\nresponse, the Commissioner alleges that the ALJ did consider shore\u2019s work history and properly\nrejected Shore\u2019s subjective complaints after concluding that they were not supported by the\nmedical evidence. (D.I. 22 at 14-16)\n\nHere, Shore\u2019s subjective complaints are not fully supported by the evidence of record for\nthe reasons previously discussed at \u00a7 IIJ.B.1, supra. The law is well-established that the ALJ\u2019s\nfailure to afford Shore heightened credibility based solely on her work history does not amount\nto an error requiring remand. See Corley v. Barnhart, 102 F. App\u2019x 752, 755 (3d Cir. 2004)\n(\u201c(T]he ALJ did not err by failing to afford Corley heightened credibility based solely on his\nwork history.\u201d). An ALJ\u2019s failure to explicitly consider a claimant\u2019s lengthy record of\ncontinuous work is not subject to remand where, as here, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is\nbased on an explanation of the substantial evidence of record supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision. See\nSanborn v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 613 F. App\u2019x 171, 177 (3d Cir. 2015) (finding that \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s\ncredibility determination . . . based on a broad view of the record . . . would have been supported\nby substantial evidence regardless of whether the ALJ had explicitly considered [the claimant\u2019s]\n\nemployment history.\u201d).\n\n20\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Shore\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 17) is DENIED,\n\nand the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 21) is GRANTED.
