No. 21-856-RGA \nSuperior Court of the State of \nJAMES A. HEGEDUS and VIRGINIA E. : Delaware in and for Sussex County \nHEGEDUS, C.A. No. S15L-12-053 \nDefendants . \nMEMORANDUM \nOn June 15, 2021, Defendants James A. Hegedus and Virginia E. Hegedus \n(\"Defendants\") filed a notice of removal of Delaware State Court C.A. No. S15L-12-053. \n(D.I. 1) Defendants appear prose and have paid the filing fee. Defendants filed a \nmotion for supplemental pleading and a request for default. (D.I. 3, 8). Plaintiff moves \nfor remand. (D.I. 5). Briefing is complete. For the reasons discussed below, the Court \nwill grant the motion to remand the matter to the Superior Court of the State of \nDelaware in and for Sussex County, will grant the motion for supplemental pleadings , \nand will deny the request for default. \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nDefendants did not provide a copy of the complaint with their notice of removal. \nThis is not the first time, however, that Defendants have removed Superior Court C.A. \nNo. S15L-12-053 to this Court. See Bank of New York, Mellon v. Hegedus, Civ. No. 18-\n1372-LPS. As explained in the Court's November 6, 2018 memorandum and order that \nremanded Delaware State Court C.A. No. S15L-12-053 to State Court, On December 29, 2015, Plaintiff filed an In Rem Scire Facias \nmortgage foreclosure complaint in the Superior Court of the State of \nDelaware in and for Sussex County, C.A. No. S15L-12-053 . The \ncomplaint sought foreclosure of property located in Delaware. On \nDecember 18, 2017, the Superior Court ruled in favor of Plaintiff and \nagainst Defendants . Defendants appealed to the Delaware Supreme \nCourt, No. 21, 2018. On July 10, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed the Superior Court on the basis of and for the reasons assigned \nby the Superior Court in its December 18, 2017 opinion. See Hegedus v. \nBank of New York Mellon, 2018 WL 3375360 (Del. 2018) (table). \nDefendants sought rehearing en bane, and it was denied on July 25, 2018. \nDefendants removed the matter on September 5, 2018. The notice \nof removal states that the case was brought under State law, but there is \nfederal question jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of \nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nBank of New York, Mellon v. Hegedus, Civ. No. 18-1372-LPS , at 0.1. 13 \n(citations to docket entries omitted) (0.Del. Nov. 6, 2018). \nThis Court remanded the matter for lack of jurisdiction . Since then, Defendants filed for \nbankruptcy; a Sheriffs Sale was held on March 16, 2021, and the property was sold; the \nSheriff returned and filed the sale with the Prothonotary on April 23, 2021; Defendants filed an \nobjection to the confirmation of Sheriffs Sale; and Defendants filed a motion to set aside the \nconfirmation of the Sheriffs Sale. U.S. Bank Nat'/ Ass'n as Trustee of NRZ Pass Through \nTrust/Xv . Hegedus, 2021 WL 1987484, at *1-2 (Del. Super. Ct. May 18, 2021). \nAfter confirmation of the Sheriffs Sale on May 18, 2021, Defendants removed the case \nfor the second time, on June 15, 2021. In the notice of removal, they included the May 18, \n2021 Order confirming the Sheriffs Sale. (D. I. 1-3 at 13-16). The Order denied Defendants ' \nobjection to the confirmation of the Sheriffs Sale, confirmed the Sheriffs Sale, and denied the \nmotion to set aside confirmation of the Sheriffs Sale. (Id. at 15-16). Defendants ' \nsupplemental pleading includes a June 21, 2021 Order that denied their motion for recission \nand relief from the May 18, 2021 Order. (0.1. 4-1 at 3-9). \n2 Plaintiff timely filed a motion to remand. (D.I. 5). Plaintiff seeks remand under the well\u00ad\npleaded complaint rule, the Rooker-Feldman Doctrine, and res judicata. (D.I. 6). Defendants \noppose. (D.I. 7). On August 20, 2021, Defendants filed a request for Plaintiffs entry of \ndefault. (D. I. 8). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nThe exercise of removal jurisdiction is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 (a), which \nstates that, in order to remove a civil action from state court to federal court, a district \ncourt must have original jurisdiction by either a federal question or diversity of \ncitizenship. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, 1441 (a). The statute is strictly construed , \nrequiring remand to state court if any doubt exists over whether removal was proper. \nShamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100, 104 (1941). \nA court will remand a removed case \"if at any time before final judgment it \nappears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction .\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). \nThe party seeking removal bears the burden to establish federal jurisdiction. Steel \nValley Auth. v. Union Switch & Signal Div. Am. Standard , Inc., 809 F.2d 1006, 1010 (3d \nCir. 1987). In determining whether remand based on improper removal is appropriate , \nthe court \"must focus on the plaintiffs complaint at the time the petition for removal was \nfiled,\" and assume all factual allegations therein are true. Id. at 1010. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nDefendants removed this case pursuant to the federal removal statute, 28 \nU.S.C.\u00a7 1441 (a). Defendants' basis for removal of the case is federal question \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The notice of removal purports to base federal \nquestion jurisdiction upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by reason of violations of their constitutional \n3 rights. (D.I. 1 at 3, 7.) Defendants indicate when the case was filed in Superior Court, it \nraised questions under state law. \nPlaintiff moves for remand based upon the \"well-pleaded complaint \" rule. In \ncommencing an action, Plaintiff decides whether to assert a federal claim, a state claim, \nor both. See Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987). When analyzing \nfederal subject matter jurisdiction, courts have traditionally looked to the well-pleaded \ncomplaint rule. Id. Under that rule, a cause of action \"'arises under' federal law, and \nremoval is proper, only if there is a federal question presented on the face of the \nplaintiff's properly pleaded complaint. \" Dukes v. U.S. Healthcare , 57 F.3d 350, 353 (3d \nCir. 1995). \"'[A] case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal \ndefense,' even if the plaintiff's complaint anticipates such defense.\" Caterpillar, 482 \nU.S. at 392. \"Nor can [the d]efendant[] create federal jurisdiction by asserting federal \ndefenses and/or counterclaims to [the p]laintiff's state law foreclosure complaint. \" \nGreen Tree Servicing LLC v. Dillard, 88 F. Supp. 3d 399,402 (D.N.J. 2015) (ordering \nremand because mortgage foreclosure is a state law case, and defendant's assertion of \nissues under the FDCPA does not create federal jurisdiction) . \nIn the instant case, Plaintiff filed an action to foreclose a mortgage , a state law \ncase, that does not arise under federal law. Defendants ' position is now that their \nconstitutional rights were violated during the foreclosure proceedings . However, as \nstated under the well-pleaded complaint rule, defenses and counterclaims do not create \nfederal court jurisdiction . This Court does not have jurisdiction by reason of a federal \nquestion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. As an aside, the Court notes that the \u00a7 1983 claim \nfails as a matter of law because there are no allegations that Defendants were deprived \n4 of a federal right by a person who acted under color of state law. See West v. Atkins, \n487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). Accordingly , the Court concludes that it does not have subject \nmatter jurisdiction in this matter. \nTherefore , the motion to remand will be granted.1 \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons the Court will: (1) grant Defendants ' motion for \nsupplemental pleading; (2) grant Plaintiff's motion to remand; (3) deny Defendants ' \nrequest for entry of default; and (4) remand this case to the Superior Court of the State \nof Delaware in and for Sussex County. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \nMarch l_, 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware \n1 Since there was no basis for the removal, the Court does not address Plaintiff's other \narguments concerning the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and res judicata. \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nTHE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON \nU.S. BANK NATIONAL, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nJAMES A HEGEDUS and VIRGINIA E. : \nHEGEDUS, \nDefendants.
