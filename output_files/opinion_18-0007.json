Williams", "date": "02-10-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA , \nPlaintiff, \nV. Criminal Action No. 18-0007-GBW \nABDOULA YE DIALLO , \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nThis Court sentenced Abdoulaye Diallo (\"Diallo\") to eighty-four (84) months in prison in \nJanuary 2020. D.I. 43. Pending now before the Court is Diallo's \"motion for a reduction of \nsentence via compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 3582(c)(l)(A).\" D.I. 50 at 1. The Court \nhas considered the parties' briefing, D.I. 50; D.I. 52, and no hearing is necessary. For the reasons \nbelow, the Court denies Diallo's motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn January 8, 2020, Judge Leonard Stark sentenced Diallo to 84 months imprisonment and \nthree years of supervised release after he pled guilty to one count of distribution of a mixture and \nsubstance containing fentanyl. D.I. 43. Diallo's \"anticipated release date is June 26, 2024.\" D.I. \n52 at 2. On May 27, 2021, Diallo asked the Court for compassionate release because of \"chronic \nstrep throat infections \" and other medical ailments combined with the risk of COVID-19 infection; \nthe need to test Diallo as a donor match for a kidney for his father and to help his mother care for \nhis siblings; and crowded conditions at Federal Correctional Institution (\"FCI\") Schuylkill\u00ad\nDiallo's place of incarceration-that he argued facilitated COVID-19 's spread. D.I. 46 at 12-16. \nDiallo argued that he had served approximately half of his projected sentence, learned from his \nmistakes, and made strides as an individual. D.I. 46 at 18-22. Judge Stark, on July 21, 2021, \n1 denied Diallo's motion because Judge Stark found that Diallo had not presented \"extraordinary \nand compelling circumstances that merit modifying his sentence. \" D.I. 49 at 2. Judge Stark noted \nthat Diallo was vaccinated against COVID-19 , that Diallo did not present evidence of chronic strep \nthroat or that the BOP refused a request to test him as a kidney donor, and that Diallo's need to \ncare for his siblings if his father passed away was \"speculative \" \"at this stage[.]\" D.I. 49 at 2-4. \nOn August 15, 2022, Diallo filed another compassionate release request with the warden \nof FCI Schuylkill. D.I. 50 at 1-2. On August 24, 2022, the warden denied that request. D.I. 50 \nat 4-5; D.I. 52 at 2. Diallo filed the motion now at issue in November of 2022. D.I. 50 at 1. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A ), the Court may \"modify a term of imprisonment \" \"upon \nmotion of the defendant \" after the defendant has asked the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") to bring \nsuch a motion and either thirty days has elapsed or the defendant has exhausted administrativ e \nremedies. Modification of a sentence is appropriate if, ( 1) \"after considering the factors set forth \nin [18 U.S.C. \u00a7] 3553(a)[,]\" the Court finds (2) \"extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant \nsuch a reduction \" and (3) \"such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued \nby the Sentencing Commission .... \" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A). However, the Third Circuit has \nfound that the Sentencing Commission 's policy statement on compassionate release is persuasive, \nrather than binding, authority for district courts. See United States v. Andrews , 12 F.4th 255, 259-\n60 (3d Cir. 2021). The applicable policy statement directs courts to also consider (4) whether \n\"[t]he defendant is not a danger to the safety of any other person or to the community, as provided \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g) .... \" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.13(2) (last amended Nov. 1, 2018). \nThe sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) are as follows: \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed [i.e., to reflect the offense's \n2 \"seriousness,\" afford \"adequate deterrence ,\" \"protect the public,\" and provide \n\"correctional treatment\"]; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of \nsentence and the sentencing range established for-(A) the applicable category of \noffense committed by the applicable category of defendant ... ; (5) any pertinent \npolicy statement-(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission (B) that ... is in effect \non the date the defendant is sentenced[;] (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of \nsimilar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nThe Government does not contest that Diallo met his statutory exhaustion requirement. \nD.I. 52 at 2. However, the Government argues that Diallo fails to show extraordinary and \ncompelling circumstances for release or that the\u00a7 3553(a) factors favor release. D.I. 52 at 1, 17. \nThe Court finds, as it did previously , see D.I. 43, that Diallo fails to present extraordinary and \ncompelling reasons that would favor a modification of his sentence. \nDiallo presents, by the Court's count, five reasons that his circumstances are \"extraordinary \nand compelling. \" First, the BOP adopted \"modified operations \" that limit inmate access to \nprograms and recreation. D.I. 50 at 2. Diallo argues that such \"onerous conditions of confinement \nare certainly not what this court anticipated when imposing the 84-month term of imprisonment. \" \nId. Second, overcrowding of one or more BOP halfway houses (i.e., residential reentry centers, \nsee United States v. Gonzalez , 2021 WL 1088258, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 22, 2021)) in Delaware \nwill likely limit Diallo' s access to such a facility. Third, \"Diallo was vaccinated and still contracted \n[COVID-19].\" D.I. 50 at 3. Fourth, Diallo's \"father is currently undergoing dialys[i]s and waiting \nfor a kidney\" and Diallo \"will be the main care taker [sic] of the household when released, as he \nis the oldest of four.\" Id. Fifth, Diallo has made strides to reduce his risk ofrecidivism and prepare \nfor reentry into the community with family support. Id. \nThe Court considers the Sentencing Commission's policy statement as persuasive authority \nfor the definition of \"extraordinary and compelling.\" Andrews, 12 F.4th at 259-60. The \n3 statement's \"Application Notes\" explain that extraordinary and compelling circumstances include \n(A) a terminal illness or a permanent \"serious physical or medical condition ... that substantially \ndiminishes\" the defendant's ability \"to provide self-care\"; (B) a \"serious deterioration in physical \nor mental health because of the aging process\" in an inmate who is at least age 55; (C) death or \nincapacitation of \"the caregiver of the defendant's minor child or minor children\" or spouse; and \n(D) a catchall of other reasons. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB 1.13, cmt. 1. Further, this Court has found that the \nordinary meaning of '\"extraordinary\"' is \"'exceptional to a very marked extent' or 'far from \ncommon,\"' and that the ordinary meaning of \"'compelling\"' is \"'tending to convince or convert \nby or as ifby forcefulness of evidence.\"' United States v. Helm, 2022 WL 613689, at *3 (D. Del. \nMar. 2, 2022) (quoting dictionary definitions); see Andrews, 12 F.4th at 260 (explaining that courts \n\"'look to dictionary definitions to determine the ordinary meaning of a word'\" ( citation omitted)). \nThe Court disagrees that Diallo' s circumstances, either alone or in combination, rise to the \nlevel of extraordinary and compelling. Diallo fails to explain beyond generalities how changes to \nBOP policy have restricted programs and recreation in FCI Schuylkill or for him, personally. See \nD.I. 50 at 2. Diallo's sentence nowhere mentions a halfway house, D.I. 43, so the unavailability \nthereof is not an exceptional reason to modify that sentence. Also, Diallo does not suggest that he \nsuffered any complications from his COVID-19 illness. D.I. 50 at 3. That Diallo contracted \nCOVID-19 and survived both grants some near-term immunity against COVID-19 and suggests \nDiallo is at a lower risk of severe COVID-19 complications in the future.1 See United States v. \nBarksdale, 2021 WL 5632076, at *1-2 (3d Cir. Dec. 1, 2021) (upholding the district court's \nfinding of no extraordinary and compelling circumstances, which was based in part on the inmate's \n1 See SARS-Co V-2 Infection-induced and Vaccine-induced Immunity, Ctrs. for Disease Control & \nPrevention (Oct. 29, 2021 ), https://www.cdc.gov /coronavirus /2019-ncov /science/science\u00ad\nbriefs/vaccine-induced-immunity .html ( discussing \"infection-induced immunologic protection\"). \n4 contraction and recovery from COVID-19); United States v. Wandell, 2022 WL 1535276, at *1-2 \n(3d Cir. May 16, 2022) (upholding as \"permissible \" the district court's consideration of the \ninmate's lessened risk of '\"serious health consequences\"' because the inmate already contracted \nand recovered from COVID-19 ( citation omitted)). Further, Diallo provides no evidence that his \nsiblings are either minor children or without supervision or care-the government argues that they \nare not, D.I. 52 at 16-and provides no means to verify that he would, in fact, be their caregiver. \nMany share the experience of a parent's illness,2 so the illness of Diallo's father is, unfortunately , \nfar from uncommon or rare. Lastly, the Court celebrates Diallo's efforts to prepare himself for \nsuccessful reentry. However, Diallo provides no evidence or discussion of any specific efforts at \nself-improvement , see D.I. 50 at 3 (\"He has been programming as much as possible .... \"), and, \nthus, the Court cannot determine if Diallo's efforts are either uncommon or persuasive. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThus, for the reasons above, the Court finds that Diallo fails to offer extraordinary and \ncompelling reasons for compassionate release. The Court need not, and does not, consider whether \nDiallo meets the other requirements for compassionate release. \nTherefore, at Wilmington this \\\u00a2' day of February 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat Diallo's motion for a reduction of sentence via compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3582(c)(l)(A) (D.I. 50) is DENIED . \nNrVYJ \" GREGORYB.
