Sometimes , unexpected events \ndisrupt their deal, making it too expensive to follow through. When that happens, \nthey need not stick to a commercially unworkable bargain. They may walk away with-\nout paying damages.  \nHere, such an unforeseen event  imposed new costs on the parties. So they  could \nhave abandoned their deal . Instead, Dole  assured Murphy that it would bear the  \ncosts , inducing Murphy\u2019s continued performance. Yet Dole later  reneged.  Those alle-\ngations  are enough to state a claim for promissory estoppel. But the promises were \nnot knowingly false when made, so Murphy\u2019s  promissory -fraud  claim  fails.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nMurphy Marine agreed to unload Dole Fresh Fruit Company\u2019s ships at the Port of \nWilmington. But that arrangement was disrupted when Delaware privatized the \nPort. The Port\u2019s new operator, Gulftainer, imposed fees on all stevedores, including \nMurphy. Third Am. Compl., D.I. 84 \u00b6\u00b6  10\u221213. And t hose fees made unloading Dole\u2019s \nships much more expensive. Id. \u00b6 27.  \nMurphy\u2019s  contract with Dole did not expressly say whether Dole would pay the \nfees. But f aced with the prospect of losing money every time it unloaded a s hip, Mur-\nphy told Dole \u201cthat [it] could not continue to work Dole vessels unless Dole was willing \nto reimburse [it].\u201d Id. \u00b6 30.  3 In response, Dole executives assured Murphy that it would not \u201cstiff\u201d Murphy or \n\u201cleave [Murphy] hanging.\u201d Id. \u00b6 35 (alteration i n orig inal) . Reassured, Murphy paid \nthe fees and kept unloading Dole\u2019s ships. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 40, 46. Yet Dole never paid up.  \nSo Murphy sued Dole, relying on a long list of contractual, quasicontractual, and \ntort theories. Last year, I dismissed many of those claims. Mem. Op., D.I. 79. But I \nallowed Murphy\u2019s breach- of-contract and breach -of-good -faith claims to proceed. And \nI dismissed its promissory estoppel and fraud claims without prejudice, giving it an-\nother chance to plead those claims.  \nMurphy seized that seco nd chance and amended its complaint. It  again alleges  \npromissory estoppel and fraud, plus it tacks on a new plea for punitive damages. \nThird Am. Compl . \u00b6\u00b6 121\u2013 44. Now, Dole moves to dismiss those claims. D.I. 85.  To \nsurvive, Murphy\u2019s complaint must contain enough facts to \u201cstate a claim to relief that \nis plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  \nII. MURPHY \u2019S PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL CLAIM MAY PROCEED  \nTo state a claim for promissory estoppel, Murphy must plead that Dole promised \nto pay the tariff, that Murphy  reasonably relied on that promise, and that it suffered \nharm when Dole refused to pay. See Lord v. Souder , 748 A.2d 393, 399 (Del. 2000).  \nMurphy\u2019s last attempt to state this claim stumbled because it did not allege any \nharm. As I explained , \u201c[w]hen [Murphy] was billed for the tariff, [it] had a choice. It \ncould continue to unload Dole\u2019s ships and pay the fee, or it could breach the contract and pay damages to Dole. Either way, Murphy would have to pay roughly the same amount of money.\u201d D.I. 79, at 9.  4 To get around that problem, Murphy now claims that it could have costlessly \nbreached its contract with Dole because commercial impracticability excused it from \nperforming. Third Am. Compl . \u00b6\u00b6 123\u221226. That argument creates a case within a \ncase. To eva luate it, I must consider a hypothetical dispute : What would have hap-\npened had Murphy breached its contract with Dole and refused to unload Dole\u2019s ships? Could it have raised commercial impracticability as a defense?  \nAt the motion -to-dismiss stage, Murphy plausibly alleges that it could have raised \nthat defense. To claim commercial impracticability, Murphy would have had to show \nthat Gulftainer\u2019s imposition of fees was an unanticipated event that disrupted \u201ca \nbasic assumption of the contract,\u201d that the fees  made Murphy\u2019s \u201ccontinued perfor-\nmance \u2026 commercially [im] practicable,\u201d and that Murphy did not \u201cagree to perform[  ] \nin spite of impracticability.\u201d CRS Proppants LLC v. Preferred Resin Holding Co. , 2016 \nWL 6094167, at *6, 8  (Del. Sup. Ct. Sept. 27, 2016); see also Restatement (Second) of \nContracts \u00a7  261. Murphy checked those boxes here.  \nTo start, the fees were unanticipated. See Friedco of Wilmington, Del., Ltd. v. \nFarmers Bank of Del ., 529 F.  Supp. 822, 82 6 (D. Del. 1981) . When the parties  signed \nthe contract, the Port was state -run. So there was no need for their agreement  to \ncover  private fees. Indeed,  Murphy says, had the tariff been imposed when the Port \nwas state -run, it would have been a \u201ctax,\u201d which t he contract allowed Murphy to pass \nalong to Dole. D.I. 88, at 2 . There were no equivalent private fees to allocate, so the \nparties likely did not think about it.  5 The fees also undermined a basic assumption of the agreement, making it com-\nmercially impracticable for Murphy to perform. Under the contract, Dole paid Mur-\nphy a markup on its labor bill plus a management fee.  Third Am. Compl . \u00b6 28. That \npayment structure w as premised on Murphy \u2019s making  a profit  over its costs . Yet the \ntariff meant that Murphy would lose money on the deal. Even  Dole conceded  that \nMurphy could not keep  operating that way . Third Am. Compl . \u00b6\u00b6 30, 37 ; cf. Friedco , \n529 F. Supp., at  830 (holding that a five -percent reduction in revenue is not enough \nto show commercial impracticability).  \nLast, Murphy did not agree to perform despite the impracticability. True, Murphy \nkept unloading Dole\u2019s ships after the tariff was imposed.  D.I. 85, at 7. But it did so  \nonly because Dole said it would cover the fees. Third Am. Compl . \u00b6 35. It did not agree \nto continue under the original bargain.  \nDole protests that a commercial impracticability defense excuses only future per-\nformance ; it does not authorize \u201cretroactive relief.\u201d D.I. 85, at 6. Thus, Dole says , \nMurphy cannot rely on commercial impracticability to get damages. True enough. But \nMurphy does not use the doctrine itself  to claim relief. Instead, it uses the doctrine to \nsupport its promissory -estoppel claim. Third Am. Compl . \u00b6\u00b6 123\u221226. Murphy  con-\ntends that it could have walked away from the contract without paying damages be-\ncause the agreement was impracticable. Yet it did not do so because Dole promised \nto pay the tariff. Thus , it was harmed in reliance on that promise when Dole reneged.  \nAt this stage, that is enough for Murphy\u2019s promissory estoppel claim to proceed. \nOf course, at summary judgment or tria l, Dole may show that Murphy\u2019s 6 characterizations of events \u2014including its commercial impracticability allegations \u2014\ndo not stand up to scrutiny.  \nIII. MURPHY \u2019S FRAUD CLAIMS FAIL \nMurphy\u2019s second attempt to plead fraud does not pan out. It  alleges that Dole and \ntwo of its executives \u2014Barry Jung and David Lennon\u2014misled it when they promised \nto pay for the tariff. So it sued all three for negligent misrepresentation. Third Am. \nCompl . \u00b6\u00b6 134\u221244.  \nYet this version of Murphy\u2019s  complaint promptly runs into a hurdle : it mischarac-\nterizes its claim s against Dole and the executives. Murphy purports to sue them for \nnegligent misrepresentation \u2014that is, a failure to take proper care in giving infor-\nmation to a business partner. See Kuhn Const. Co. v. Ocean & Coastal Consultants, \nInc., 723 F. Supp. 2d 676,  687 (D. Del. 2010). But here, the alleged misstatements \n\u201ctake the form of unfulfilled promises of future performance,\u201d not erroneous facts. Winner Acceptance Corp. v. Return on Cap.  Corp. , 2008\n WL 5352063, at * 9 (Del. Ch. \nDec. 23, 2008). So Murphy\u2019s misre presentation claim s are really for promissory fraud, \nand I will treat them  as such.  \nTo state a claim for promissory fraud, Murphy must \u201cplead specific facts that \u2026 \n[show] the promisor had no intention of performing at the time the promise was \nmade.\u201d Id. at *10. Plus, it must \u201cinject [] precision \u2026 into [its] allegations\u201d by provid-\ning \u201cthe date, place or time of the fraud,\u201d and by stating \u201cwho made [the] misrepre-\nsentation to whom and [its] general content.\u201d Kuhn Const. Co. v. Ocean & Coastal \nConsultants, Inc ., 844 F. Supp. 2d 519,  530 (D. Del. 2012)  (quoting Lum v. Bank of \nAmerica,  361 F.3d 217, 224 (3rd Cir.  2004) ) (first alteration in original) .  7 I dismissed Murphy\u2019s last attempt to state this claim because it did not  plead fraud \nwith enough detail or  explain how it was harmed . D.I. 79, at 13 \u221214. Though it now \nexplains how it was harmed \u2014Dole induced it to  proceed under a  commercially im-\npracticable  contract\u2014 its allegations  are still not  detailed  enough.  \nMurphy alleges that Jung and Lennon \u201crepeatedly assured [it] that Dole would \nnot \u2018stiff\u2019 Murphy or \u2018leave [Murphy] hanging\u2019 for the [] fees.\u2019 \u201d Third Am. Compl . \u00b6 35 \n(first alternation in original) . But it still does not plead \u201cspecific facts\u201d showing that \nthey knew their statements were false when they made them. Winner , 2008  WL \n5352063, at *10. True, Murphy says that \u201cfrom the get -go\u201d Dole never  intended  to \npay. Third Am. Compl . \u00b6 54. But it does not provide a single fact in support of that  \nbare assertion.  \nPlus, even if Dole had decided not to pay, nothing in the complaint suggests that \nJung and Lennon knew about that decision when they reassured Murphy. Indeed, \nMurphy admits that Jung and Lennon told a senior executive via email that they had \u201ccommitted to [Murphy] that we would not leave [it]  hanging for the [] fees.\u201d Id. \u00b6 50. \nThat exchange  strongly suggests that Jung and Lennon intended to follow through \non their promise.  \nPleading promissory fraud is hard . That high bar ensures  that most unfulfilled \npromises are dealt with by contract, not tort. Here, Murphy\u2019s complaint falls short. So I dismiss its fraud claims with prejudice. But it can still litigate this as a contract \ncase.  8 IV. MURPHY  MAY NOT SUE FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES  \nMurphy\u2019s amended complaint also tacks on a new plea for punitive damages. \nThird Am. Compl . \u00b6 144. Murphy  claims that this is an \u201cegregious  case[] of willful \nand malicious breach of contract.\u201d D.I. 88 at 18 (quoting Reiver v. Murdock & Walsh, \nP.A., 625 F. Supp. 998, 1014 (D. Del. 1985). But that claim is belied by the facts in \nthe complaint.  \nIn Delaware, punitive damages for breach of contract  are available whe n a party\u2019s \nbreach is \u201cwithout \u2026 cause, for the purpose of injuring [the other party] by depriving \nhim of the benefit of the [contract].\u201d Oliver B. Cannon & Son, Inc. v. Fidelity & Cas-\nualty Co. , 484 F. Supp. 1375, 1388 ( D. Del. 1980). Thus, punitive damages  are pre-\ncluded  \u201cas a matter of law\u201d where \u201cthe breaching party\u2019s non -performance was based \non that party\u2019s belief that a meritorious defense exists.\u201d Reiver , 625 F. Supp. at 1015 \n(collecting cases).  \nHere, Dole has a meritorious defense for its alleged nonperformance. Murphy ad-\nmits that \u201cthe Agreement was silent on which party would bear the costs arising from \nimposition of the [t]ariff.\u201d Third Am. Compl . \u00b6 23. Instead, it  says Dole breached the \ncontract because the priv ate tariff counted as a state \u201ctax\u201d that Murphy could pass \non to Dole.  That reading may be plausible, but it was not egregious for Dole to take a \ndifferent view  and refuse to pay . Thus, Murphy may not seek punitive damages here.  \n* * * * * \nGulftainer\u2019s tariff  disrupted Murphy\u2019s deal with Dole, making it commercially im-\npracticable for Murphy to perform. So Murp hy could have walked away. Yet Dole \npromised to cover the tariff, inducing Murphy to keep unloading its ships. When Dole 9 later reneged , Murphy was left holding the bag.  Those allegations are enough to state \na claim for promissory estoppel. But Dole\u2019s promises were not knowingly false when \nmade, so Murphy\u2019s promissory -fraud claim fails . And because Dole had good reason \nto believe it did n ot breach the contract, Murphy cannot get punitive damages.
