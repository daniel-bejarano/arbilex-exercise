LUNDBECK A/S,    : \n: \n   P l a i n t i f f s ,    :   \nv.          : C.A. No. 19-1938-LPS \n           :    \nZENARA PHARMA PRIVATE LTD., et al.,  : \n       :     D e f e n d a n t s .    :     \n           \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n \nAt Wilmington this 21st day of September, 2022 , having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefing \nand other submissions (D.I. 554, 555, 565, 568) rela ted to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and \nH. Lundbeck A/S\u2019 (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) Daubert motion, directed at excluding the opinions \nand testimony of Defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. Jeffrey Aub\u00e9, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion (D.I. 554) is DENIED , for the \nreasons set out below. \n1. Federal Rule of Evidence 702 creates a \u201cg atekeeping role for th e [trial] judge\u201d to \n\u201censur[e] that an expert \u2019s testimony both rests on a reliable fo undation and is relevant to the task \nat hand.\u201d  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. , 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993).  There are three \ndistinct requirements for admissi ble expert testimony: (1) the expe rt must be qualified, (2) the \nopinion must be reliable, and (3) the opinion must relate to the facts.  See generally Elcock v. \nKmart Corp. , 233 F.3d 734, 741-46 (3d Cir. 2000).  Hence, ex pert testimony is admissible if a \nqualified expert provides opinions \u201cbased on suff icient facts or data,\u201d  \u201cthe testimony is the \nproduct of reliable principles and methods,\u201d and \u201cthe expert has re liably applied the principles 2 \n and methods to the facts of the case.\u201d  Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d) .  Rule 702 embodies a \u201cliberal \npolicy of admissibility.\u201d  Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal \ncitations omitted).  Motions to exclude eviden ce are committed to th e Court\u2019s discretion.  See In \nre Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 749 (3d Cir. 1994). \n2. Plaintiffs contend that Dr. Aub\u00e9 is not qua lified to provide expert opinions with \nrespect to the patents-in-suit (U .S. Patent Nos. RE48,059, 8,349,840, 8,618,109, and 9,839,637; \nhereinafter, the \u201cBrexpiprazole Patents\u201d).  ( See D.I. 555 at 5)  In their view, \u201ca person of \nordinary skill in the art seeki ng to develop an improved atypical  antipsychotic drug must have \nhad experience developing antipsychotic drug ca ndidates, as well as a strong understanding of \nthe complex pharmacology associated  with them and the CNS.\u201d  ( Id. at 6) (citing Pl. Ex. A \n(Ward Rebuttal Report) \u00b6 17; Pl. Ex. G (Rothschild Opening Report)  \u00b6 75)  Dr. Aub\u00e9 \u201cdoes not \nhave experience in psychiatry\u201d or \u201cwork[ing] at a pharmaceutical comp any to develop a drug \ncandidate,\u201d and \u201cis not a medica l doctor,\u201d pharmacologist, or pharm acist; nor is he trained in \npharmacology.  ( Id. at 3-4) (citations omitted)  Plaintif fs also challenge Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s reliance on \nthe opinion of Defendants\u2019 expert , Dr. Anthony Rothschild, \u201cwith re spect to the ps ychiatry and \npharmacology aspects of the art.\u201d  ( Id. at 4) (citing Pl. Ex. B (A ub\u00e9 Opening Report) \u00b6 53)  \nPlaintiffs further point out th at Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s pre-priority-dat e research did not relate to \nantipsychotics or their associated receptors, adding that they belie ve he has not gained sufficient \nexperience since the priority date  to qualify him to testify.  ( Id.)  Therefore, according to \nPlaintiffs, \u201c[b]efore the priority date of the Brexpiprazole Patent s, Dr. Aub\u00e9 was not a person of \nordinary skill, which is a re quirement for a witness offeri ng expert testimony concerning \nobviousness.\u201d  ( Id.) 3 \n 3. In response, Defendants contend that Dr. Aub\u00e9 qualifies as a person of ordinary \nskill under Plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 proffered definition.  ( See D.I. 565 at 9-10) (quoting Pl. Ex. A \n(Ward Rebuttal Report) \u00b6 17)  Defendants highli ght Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s Ph.D. in  organic chemistry and \nhis years of postdoctoral research  experience, as well as his expertise as a medicinal chemist who \nhas worked on the development of drug candidates a nd whose experience is, at least according to \nhis testimony, \u201creasonably por table across fields.\u201d  ( E.g., id. at 2-3, 9-10) (quoting Def. Ex. C \n(Aub\u00e9 Dep. Tr.) at 156)  Defenda nts also point to Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s 20 years of experience teaching \npharmacy students about the medicina l chemistry of antipsychotics ( id. at 10) (citing Def. Ex. B \n(Aub\u00e9 Opening Report) \u00b6 7), and his prio r research on antipsy chotic receptors ( id. at 3) (citing \nDef. Ex. C (Aub\u00e9 Dep. Tr.) at 43 ).  Defendants also contend that , given the collaborative nature \nof drug development, it is pr oper for Dr. Aub\u00e9 to rely Dr . Rothschild\u2019s pharmacology \nknowledge.  ( Id. at 11-12) \n4. The Court is not persuaded that it sh ould exclude Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s opinions and \ntestimony.  The Third Circuit has a \u201cliberal standard[] for [the] quali fications of experts . . . .\u201d  In \nre Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d at 754.  \u201cWe have eschewed imposing overly rigorous \nrequirements of expertise and have been satisf ied with more generalized qualifications.\u201d  Id. at \n741.  Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s qualifications are sufficient for purposes of this case.  Dr. Aub\u00e9 has a Ph.D. in \nchemistry and postdoctoral research experience.  ( See, e.g. , Def. Ex. B (Aub\u00e9 Opening Report) \n\u00b6 5)  He also has extensive experience teach ing pharmacy students about antipsychotics ( id. \u00b6 7) \nand has done research on antipsychotic receptors (Def. Ex. C (Aub\u00e9 Dep. Tr.) at 43), in addition \nto his medicinal-chemistry research experience ( see, e.g. , D.I. 565 at 2-3).  Dr. Aub\u00e9 offers his \ntestimony as an \u201cexpert in medi cinal chemistry and drug discovery  and design, with experience \nwith the central nervous system.\u201d  (Def. Ex. B (Aub\u00e9  Opening Report) \u00b6 16)  Plaintiffs are free to 4 \n question Dr. Aub\u00e9 about his quali fications, and may argue that th ey are not as good as others\u2019, \nbut their challenges go to the weight that might  be accorded to his opinions and not to their \nadmissibility.  See generally Kannankeril v. Terminix Int\u2019l, Inc. , 128 F.3d 802, 809 (3d Cir. \n1997) (stating that where expert meets \u201cliberal minimum qualifica tions, then the level of [his] \nexpertise goes to credibility and weight, not admissibility\u201d). \n5. The Court likewise finds no basis to  preclude Dr. Aub\u00e9\u2019s reliance on Dr. \nRothschild\u2019s opinion.  Defendants will present evidence that drug development is conducted by a \nteam and are free to argue that such a team might include member s with qualifications like those \nof Dr. Aub\u00e9 and Dr. Rothschild. \n6. Finally, the trial will be a bench trial.  Having reviewed the materials submitted in \nconnection with Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the Court is of the view that  Dr. Aube\u2019s testimony will be \nhelpful to it as the finder of fact. \n \n \n       ________________________________ \n       HONORABLE LEONARD P.
