No. 21-860-GBW\n: Superior Court of the State of\nCHRISTOPHER FEDDER, : Delaware in and for Sussex County\n: Case No. 21-04-008842\nDefendant. :\n\nChristopher Fedder, Bear, Delaware, Pro Se Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n0\nOctober \\ L, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n76 dt\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:\nL INTRODUCTION\n\nDefendant Christopher Fedder (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cFedder\u201d) removed this state\ncriminal matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445. (D.I. 1) On September 16, 2022, the\nCourt ordered Defendant to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for\nfailure to prosecute. (D.I. 6) Defendant responds that his criminal case is still\nongoing and asks that the case remain open. (D.I. 7)\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nOn April 15, 2021, Defendant was arrested on charges of possession of a\nfirearm during the commission of a felony and assault 2\u2122 degree. (D.I. 1 at 16)\nAs of September 25, 2022, the criminal case was pending in the Superior Court of\nthe State of Delaware in and for Sussex County. (D.I. 7) Defendant is represented\nby counsel. (/d.) Defendant removed this matter on June 16, 2021 pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1455 for violations of his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation,\nright to discovery of the State\u2019s evidence against him, right to cross-examine\nwitnesses, and right to a fair trial. (D.I. 1 at 2)\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nIn order for a case to be removable to the district court, the Court must have\noriginal jurisdiction by either a federal question or diversity of citizenship. 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, 1441. \u201cOnly state-court actions that originally could have\nbeen filed in federal court may be removed to federal court by the defendant.\u201d\nKline v. Security Guards, Inc., 386 F.3d 246, 252 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting\nCaterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987)). If the case could not have\nbeen filed originally in federal court, then removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 is\nimproper and remand is appropriate. Jd. (citations omitted).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nRemoval of state criminal matters is permitted in limited instances under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1443. Pursuant to \u00a7 1443(1), a criminal prosecution commenced in a\nState court may be removed to the district court of the United States for the district\nand division embracing the place wherein it is pending against any person who is\ndenied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing\nfor the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the\njurisdiction thereof. 28 U.S.C. 1443(1). A state court defendant who seeks\nremoval of a criminal prosecution to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1)\n\u201cmust demonstrate both (1) that he is being deprived of rights guaranteed bya\nfederal law \u2018providing for . . . equal civil rights\u2019; and (2) that he is \u2018denied or\ncannot enforce that right in the courts\u2019 of the state.\u201d Davis v. Glanton, 107 F.3d\n1044, 1047 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 788 (1966)).\nWith respect to the first prong, \u201cthe phrase \u2018any law providing for . . . equal civil\n\nrights\u2019 must be construed to mean any law providing for specific civil rights stated\nin terms of racial equality.\u201d Rachel, 384 at 792 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(a)).\nSecond, it must appear, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 1443(1), that the\nremoval petitioner is denied or cannot enforce the specified federal rights in the\ncourts of the State. Johnson v. Mississippi, 421 U.S. 213, 219 (1975) (citations\nomitted).\n\nDefendant alleges in a conclusory manner violations of his Sixth\nAmendment right to self-representation, right to discovery of the State\u2019s evidence\nagainst him, right to cross-examine witnesses, and right to a fair trial. He believes\nthat bias exists against him in the Delaware legal system. He contends that he\ncannot get an unbiased jury pool due to the reporting of inaccurate facts and an\ninaccurate press release made by the Delaware State Police. Defendant, however,\ndoes not assert that he cannot get a fair and impartial trial or that he is denied equal\naccess to the Superior Court. Moreover, Defendant is represented by counsel in\nthe criminal matter. There are no assertions that provide a basis for this Court\u2019s\nproposed exercise of subject matter jurisdiction. Nor are there allegations that\nDefendant cannot enforce his asserted rights in state court. In re Weddington, 2008\nWL 686381 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 12, 2008); see also State v. Haws, 131 F.3d 1205, 1209\n(7th Cir. 1997). The notice of removal simply does not lead to the conclusion that\nDefendant cannot enforce any asserted rights in state court. Moreover, it is\n\ngenerally presumed that \u201cthe protection of federal constitutional or statutory rights\n[can] be effected in the pending state proceedings, civil or criminal.\u201d Johnson, 421\nU.S. at 219-20. For the above reasons, the Court will summarily remand this\ncriminal matter.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons the Court will summarily remand this matter to the\nSuperior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County (Case No. 21-\n04-008842).\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civ.
