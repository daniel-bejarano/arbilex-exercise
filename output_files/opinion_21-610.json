Andrews", "date": "08-24-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nSUSAN PAITSEL,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 21-610-RGA\n\nKILOLO KIJAKAZI, Acting\nCommissioner of Social Security, :\n\nDefendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nSusan Paitsel, Frederica, Delaware; Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nBrian O'Donnell, Regional Chief Counsel, and Robert Drum, Assistant Regional\nCounsel, Social Security Administration, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; David C. Weiss,\nUnited States Attorney for the District of Delaware, and Heather Benderson, Special\nAssistant United States Attorney, Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nAugust 3 , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nwhaledl istrict Judge:\n\nPlaintiff, Susan Marie Paitsel, who appears pro se, appeals the decision of\nDefendant Kilolo Kijakazi, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, denying her\napplication for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits\nunder Titles I] and XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433, 1381-1383f.\nJurisdiction exists pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Presently pending before the Court\nare cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Paitsel and the Commissioner. (D.I.\n12, 18). Briefing is complete.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPaitsel protectively applied for benefits on December 28, 2017, and March 1,\n2018, respectively, alleging disability since January 22, 2014. (D.I. 8 at 192-198, 247).!\nThe claims were denied initially on August 27, 2018, and upon reconsideration on\nDecember 24, 2018, and Plaintiff requested a hearing. (/d. at 84-139).\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge conducted the hearing on February 18, 2020, and\nheard testimony from Paitsel, who was represented by counsel, and vocational expert\nChristina L. Beatty-Cody. (/d. at 46-83) The ALJ found that Paitsel met the insured\nstatus requirements of the Act through September 30, 2019, and had not engaged in\nsubstantial gainful activity since January 22, 2014, her alleged onset date. (/d. at 24-\n25). He also found that Paitsel had chronic pain syndrome; lumbar degenerative disc\n\ndisease; bipolar disorder; depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; obsessive-\n\n1 Reference to the pages in the transcript is to the pagination in the header, not the\nnumbering at the bottom of the page.\n\ncompulsive disorder; and anxiety, which were severe impairments, but that did not meet\nor equal the severity requirements of the Listing of Impairments. (/d. at 25-27).\nThe ALJ found that Paitsel:\n\n. could perform light work as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b) and\n416.967(b), except she could not be exposed to hazards (defined as\nclimbing ropes, ladders, or scaffolds, using dangerous moving machinery,\nor being exposed to unprotected heights); could frequently balance, stoop,\nkneel, and crouch; occasionally climb ramps and stairs, and crawl; and\noccasionally be exposed to vibration, extreme heat, extreme cold. wetness,\nhumidity, fumes, odors, dust, gases, and poor ventilation.\n\n\u00b0 was limited to simple, routine, and repetitive work, but not at a\nproduction pace, and that she could have no more than incidental and\ninfrequent contact with the general public.\n\ne could occasionally interact with coworkers and supervisors, but could\nnot perform tasks that would require her to work in tandem with coworkers\nto complete job responsibilities, and could make simple work decisions in a\nstable work environment (defined as very little change in the work setting or\nwork processes).\n\ne was unable to perform her past relevant work.\n\n(id. at 31). In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question whether an individual of\nPaitsel\u2019s age, education, and work background and the above-described limitations\ncould perform work at the light level, the VE testified that the worker would be capable\nof performing representative unskilled light occupations, including routing clerk, router,\nand tabber, representing tens of thousands of jobs in the national economy. (/d. at 31,\n79-80). The ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner upon the\nAppeals Council's denial of Paitsel\u2019s request for review. (/d. at 5-7, 189-191).\n\nPaitsel filed this civil action, pro se, seeking judicial review of the Commissioner's\ndecision. She seeks summary judgment on the grounds that the VE\u2019s testimony\nsupports a finding of disability and her impairments meet the requirements of the Listing\nof Impairments. (D.I. 12, D.I. 14 at 3). The Commissioner seeks summary judgment\n\n2\n\nand argues that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that Paitsel is not\ndisabled. (D.I. 18 at 24).\nHi. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nThe Court must uphold the Commissioner's factual decisions if they are\nsupported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); see also\nMonsour Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, 806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir. 1986). \u201cSubstantial\nevidence\u201d means less than a preponderance of the evidence but more than a mere\nscintilla of evidence. See Rutherford v. Barnhart, 399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\nAs the Supreme Court has noted, substantial evidence \u201cdoes not mean a large or\nsignificant amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind\nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S.\n552, 565 (1988).\n\nIn determining whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s\nfindings, the Court may not undertake a de novo review of the Commissioner's decision\nand may not re-weigh the evidence of record. See Monsour, 806 F.2d at 1190-91.\nThe Court\u2019s review is limited to the evidence that was presented to the ALJ. See\nMatthews v. Apfel, 239 F.3d 589, 593-95 (3d Cir. 2001). Evidence that was not\nsubmitted to the ALJ can be considered, however, by the Appeals Council or the District\nCourt as a basis for remanding the matter to the Commissioner for further proceedings,\npursuant to the sixth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). See Matthews, 239 F.3d at 592.\n\u201cCredibility determinations are the province of the ALJ and only should be disturbed on\nreview if not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Gonzalez v. Astrue, 537 F. Supp. 2d\n\n644, 657 (D. Del. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n3\nThe Third Circuit has made clear that a \u201csingle piece of evidence will not satisfy\nthe substantiality test if the [Commissioner] ignores, or fails to resolve, a conflict created\nby countervailing evidence. Nor is evidence substantial if it is overwhelmed by other\nevidence, particularly certain types of evidence (e.g., that offered by treating physicians)\n\u2014 or if it really constitutes not evidence but mere conclusion.\u201d Kent v. Schweiker, 710\nF.2d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1983). Thus, the inquiry is not whether the Court would have\nmade the same determination but, rather, whether the Commissioner's conclusion was\nreasonable. See Brown v. Bowen, 845 F.2d 1211, 1213 (3d Cir. 1988). Even if the\nreviewing Court would have decided the case differently, it must give deference to the\nALJ and affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.\nSee Monsour, 806 F.2d at 1190-91.\n\nI. DISABILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS\n\nA \u201cdisability\u201d is defined for purposes of disability insurance benefits and\nsupplemental security income as the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by\nreason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be\nexpected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a\ncontinuous period of not less than 12 months. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A),\n1382c(a)(3)(A). A claimant is disabled \u201conly if his physical or mental impairment or\nimpairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but\ncannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind\nof substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n423(d)(2)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(B); see also Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22 (2003).\n\nIn determining whether a person is disabled, the Commissioner is required to\nperform a five-step sequential analysis. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), 416.920(a);\nHess v. Commissioner of Soc. Sec., 931 F.3d 198, 201 (3d Cir. 2019). If a finding of\ndisability or nondisability can be made at any point in the sequential process, the\nCommissioner will not review the claim further. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4),\n416.920(a)(4).\n\nAt step one, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant is engaged\nin any substantial gainful activity. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i), 416.920(a)(4)(i)\n(mandating finding of nondisability when claimant is engaged in substantial gainful\nactivity); Hess, 931 F.3d at 201. If the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful\nactivity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is\nsuffering from a severe impairment or a combination of impairments that is severe. /d.\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, the Commissioner, at step three, compares\nthe claimant's impairments to a list of impairments (20 C.F.R \u00a7 404.1520, Subpart P,\nAppendix 1) that are presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work. See 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(ili); Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d\nCir. 2014). When a claimant's impairment or its equivalent matches an impairment in\nthe listing, the claimant is presumed disabled. /d. If aclaimant\u2019s impairment, either\nsingly or in combination, fails to meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis\ncontinues to steps four and five. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e); Hess, 931\nF.3d at 201.\n\nAt step four, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant retains the\n\nresidual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his or her past relevant work. See 20\n5\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(iv) (stating that claimant is not disabled if\nclaimant is able to return to past relevant work); Zirnsak, 777 F.3d at 611. Aclaimant\u2019s\nRFC \u201cis the most [a claimant] can still do despite [their] limitations.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1545(a)(1); 416.945(a)(1); Hess, 931 F.3d at 202 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1545(a)(1)).  \u201c[T]he claimant always bears the burden of establishing (1) that she is\nseverely impaired, and (2) either that the severe impairment meets or equals a listed\nimpairment, or that it prevents her from performing her past work.\u201d Zirnsak, 777 F.3d at\n611 (quoting Wallace v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 722 F.2d 1150, 1153 (3d\nCir. 1983). If the claimant cannot perform her past relevant work, the ALJ moves on to\nstep five. Hess, 931 F.3d at 202.\n\nAt step five, the ALJ examines whether the claimant \u201ccan make an adjustment to\nother work{,]\u201d considering [her] \u201c[RFC,]... age, education, and work experience[.]\u201d 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v) and (g), 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v) and (g); Hess, 931\nF.3d at 202. That examination typically involves \u201cone or more hypothetical questions\nposed by the ALJ to [a] vocational expert.\u201d Podedworny v. Harris, 745 F.2d 210, 218\n(3d Cir. 1984). If the claimant can make an adjustment to other work, she is not\ndisabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 416.920(a)(4)(v). If she cannot, she is\ndisabled.\n\nAt this last step, \u201c. . . the Commissioner bears the burden of establishing the\nexistence of other available work that the claimant is capable of performing.\u201d Zirnsak,\n777 F.3d at 612 (citing Kangas v. Bowen, 823 F.2d 775, 777 (3d Cir. 1987)). In other\nwords, the Commissioner \u201c. . . is responsible for providing evidence that demonstrates\n\nthat other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that [the claimant]\n6\ncan do, given [her] residual functional capacity and vocational factors.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n404.1560(c)(2); 416.960.(c)(2). \u201cUltimately, entitlement to benefits is dependent upon\n\n\u201d\n\nfinding the claimant is incapable of performing work in the national economy.\u201d Zimsak,\n777 F.3d 612 (quoting Provenzano v. Commissioner, 2011 WL 3859917, at *1 (D.N.J.\nAug. 31, 2011)).\n\nWhen mental impairments are at issue, additional inquiries are layered on top of\nthe basic five-step disability analysis and an ALJ assesses mental impairments. 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(a), 416.920a(a); Hess, 931 F.3d at 202. As part of step two of\nthe disability analysis, the ALJ decides whether the claimant has any \u201cmedically\ndeterminable mental impairment(s).\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(b)(1), 416.920a(b)(1);\nsee also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii) (providing that, at step two,\nthe ALJ determines whether the claimant has \u201ca severe medically determinable physical\nor mental impairment\u201d); Hess, 931 F.3d at 202. \u201c[A]s part of that same step and also\nstep three of the disability analysis, the ALJ determines \u2018the degree of functional\nlimitation resulting from the impairment(s)[.]\u201d Hess, 931 F.3d at 202 (quoting 20 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(b)(2), 416.920a(b)(2) and citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(d), 416.920a(d),\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii)-(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii)-(iii) (explaining that the ALU uses \u201cthe degree of\nfunctional limitation\u201d in assessing \u201cthe severity of [the claimant's] mental\nimpairment(s)[,]\u201d which is considered at steps two and three)).\n\nIn determining the degree of functional limitation, the ALJ considers \u201cfour broad\nfunctional areas . . .: Activities of daily living; social functioning; concentration,\npersistence, or pace; and episodes of decompensation.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n404.1520a(c)(3), 416.920a(c)(3); Hess, 931 F.3d at 202. The first three areas are\n7\n\nrated on a \u201cfive-point scale: None, mild, moderate, marked, and extreme.\u201d 20 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(c)(4), 416.920a(c)(4); Hess, 931 F.3d at 202. The fourth is rated ona\nscale of: \u201cNone, one or two, three, four or more.\u201d /d.\n\n\u201cThe ALJ uses that degree rating in \u2018determin[ing] the severity of [the] mental\nimpairment(s)[, which is considered at steps two and three. Hess, 931 F.3d at 202\n(quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(d), 416.920a(d) and citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii)-(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(ii)-(iii) (stating that, at steps two and three, the ALJ\n\u201cconsider[s] the medical severity of [the claimant's] impairment(s)\u2019). \u201cIf... the degree\nof [the claimant's] limitation in the first three functional areas [is] \u2018none\u2019 or \u2018mild\u2019 and\n\u2018none\u2019 in the fourth area, [the ALJ] will generally conclude that [the claimant's]\nimpairment(s) is not severe, unless the evidence otherwise indicates that there is more\nthan a minimal limitation in [her] ability to do basic work activities.\u201d Hess, 931 F.3d at\n202 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(d)(1), 416.920a(d)(1) (citation omitted)).\n\n\u201cAt step three, if the ALJ has found that a mental impairment is severe, he \u2018then\ndetermine[s] if it meets or is equivalent in severity to a listed mental disorder.\u201d Hess,\n931 F.3d at 202 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(d)(2), 416.920a(d}(2) and citing 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(a)(4)(iii) (explaining that, at step three, the ALJ\ndetermines whether the claimant has \u201can impairment(s) that meets or equals\u2019 a listed\nimpairment). \u201cThat analysis is done \u2018by comparing the medical findings about [the\nclaimant's] impairment(s) and the rating of the degree of functional limitation to the\ncriteria of the appropriate listed mental disorder.\u201d Hess, 931 F.3d at 203 (quoting 20\nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(d)(2), 416.920a(d)(2)). As explained by the Third Circuit, \u201cthe\n\nclaimant may have the equivalent of a listed impairment if, inter alia, he has at least two\n8\n\nof \u20181. Marked restriction of activities of daily living; or 2. Marked difficulties in maintaining\nsocial functioning; or 3. Marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or\npace; or 4. Repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration/.]\u201d\nHess, 931 F.3d at 203 (quoting 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1).\n\n\u201c[T]o complete steps four and five of the disability analysis, if the ALJ has found\nthat the claimant does not have a listed impairment or its equivalent, the ALJ \u2018will then\nassess [the claimant's mental RFC].\u201d Hess, 931 F.3d at 203 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n404.1520a(d)(3), 416.920a(d)(3) and citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv)-(v),\n416.920(a)(4)(iv)-(v) (providing that, at steps four and five, the ALJ considers the\nclaimant\u2019s RFC)).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPaitsel filed her Complaint pro se, and therefore, the Court must liberally\nconstrue her pleadings, and \u201capply the applicable law, irrespective of whether she has\nmentioned it by name.\u201d Holley v. Department of Veteran Affairs, 165 F.3d 244, 247-48\n(3d Cir. 1999); see also Leventry v. Astrue, 2009 WL 3045675 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 22,\n\n2009) (applying same in the context of a social security appeal).?\n\n2 | note Paitsel\u2019s argument that there is something wrong with the transcript of the\ntestimony at the hearing. (D.I. 19 at 5-6). | read the entire transcript (D.1. 8 at 48-83)\nand it appears to be a typical transcript where there is \u201ctalking over\u201d from time to time.\nThus, when Paitsel complains about the transcript showing a question being answered\nwith \u201cfive to ten pounds,\u201d the answer makes perfect sense if the two preceding\nquestions and answers are also considered. (/d. at 69-70). As for \u201cput on an Adderall,\u201d it\nseems apparent that that is a transcription error, not an omission. Whatever Paitsel\nactually said there, it is irrelevant to the disability issues.\n\n9\nThe ALJ found Paitsel had the following severe impairments: chronic pain\nsyndrome; lumbar degenerative disc disease; bipolar disorder; depression; post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder; and anxiety. (D.1. 8 at 25).\nHe also determined that her rheumatoid arthritis and blurry vision/vision disorder were\nnot medically determinable impairments due to a lack of objective evidence. (/d.).\n\nPaitsel argues that the ALJ erred when he did not consider the VE\u2019s responses of\n\u201cthat would preclude all work\u201d when responding to questions posed by her attorney.\nShe argues that all the scenarios posed by her attorney's hypotheticals \u201care exactly her\nlimitations.\u201d (D.I. 14 at 4). To support her position Paitsel relies upon an October 3,\n2018 health assessment form and a February 3, 2020 mental impairment questionnaire,\nboth completed by Dr. Louis Papa, her treating psychiatrist. (D.I. 8 at 490-497, 558-\n563). Conversely, the Commissioner contends that the ALJ properly relied upon the\ntestimony of the VE that jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy that\nPlaintiff can perform.\n\nThe ALJ posed the following hypothetical question to the VE:\n\n[I]f you consider a hypothetical individual of the claimant\u2019s age, education,\n\nand the past work that you just indicated. However, assume that this\n\nindividual would be limited to a range of light work. They cannot be\n\nexposed to hazards defined as climbing ropes, ladders, using dangerous\n\nmoving machinery or being exposed to unprotect heights. The individual\n\ncould frequently balance, stoop, kneel, and crouch, and can occasionally\n\nclimb ramps and stairs or crawl. This individual can occasionally be\n\nexposed to vibration, extreme heat, extreme cold, wetness, humidity,\n\nfumes, odors, dust, gases, and poor ventilation. This individual would be\n\nlimited to simple, routine, and repetitive work, but not at a production pace.\nThis individual could have no more than incidental and infrequent contact\n\n3 Paitsel\u2019s past work included general clerk, report clerk, claims clerk and data entry\nclerk. (/d. at 78).\n10\nwith the general public, can occasionally interact with coworkers and\n\nsupervisors, but cannot perform tasks that would require them to work in\n\ntandem with coworkers in order to complete job responsibilities. This\n\nindividual would be able to make simple work decisions in a stable work\n\nenvironment defined as very little change in work setting or work process.\n\nWould an individual with these limitations be able to perform any of the\n\nclaimant's past relevant work, either as she performed it or as it\u2019s\n\ngenerally performed?\n\n(D.I. 8 at 79). The VE responded the hypothetical person could not. (/d.). The ALJ\nthen asked if there was other work at the light level of exertion that someone with these\nlimitations could perform. (/d.). The VE responded, \u201cyes,\u201d at the light level of exertion,\nand she provided a sampling of positions such as routing clerk, router, and tabber;\npositions that exist in large numbers in the national economy. (/d. at 79-80).\n\nPaitsel\u2019s counsel then posed multiple questions to the VE and asked what the\nimpact would be on the ability to sustain employment with an individual who: (1) would\nbe off task twenty percent of the time during an eight-hour workday; (2) was not able to\nrespond appropriately to changes in a routine work setting; (3) would twenty-five\npercent of the day have difficulties getting along with coworkers or peers without\ndistracting them or exhibiting behavioral strain; (4) forty percent of the day was unable\nto accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticisms from their supervisors; and\n(5) was going to be absent more than four days per month due to their health problems.\n(Id. at 81-82). In each instance, the VE answered the limitation would \u201cpreclude work\u201d.\n(Id.).\n\nIn his decision, the ALJ found that Paitsel:\n\n(1) has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b), except she cannot be exposed\n\nto hazards, defined as climbing ropes, ladders, or scaffolds, using\ndangerous moving machinery, or being exposed to unprotected heights.\n\n11\n\nShe can frequently balance, stoop, kneel, and crouch; occasionally climb\nramps and stairs, and crawl; and occasionally be exposed to vibration,\nextreme heat, extreme cold, wetness, humidity, fumes, odors, dust, gases,\nand poor ventilation.\n\n(2) is limited to simple, routine, and repetitive work, but not at a production\n\npace, and that she can have no more than incidental and infrequent\n\ncontact with the general public.\n\n(3) can occasionally interact with coworkers and supervisors, but cannot\n\nnot perform tasks that would require her to work in tandem with coworkers\n\nto complete job responsibilities, and she can make simple work decisions\n\nin a stable work environment, defined as very little change in the work\n\nsetting or work processes.\n\n(4) is unable to perform any past relevant work, as actually or generally\n\nperformed, and that considering Paitsel\u2019s age, education, work\n\nexperience, and residual functional capacity, there are jobs that exist in in\n\nsignificant numbers that she can perform such as routing clerk, router, and\n\ntabber.\n(Id. at 31, 37).4\n\nPaitsel seems to argue that the ALJ's residual functional capacity assessment is\nflawed because his hypothetical did not consider all of the impairments and symptoms\nthat caused her inability to sustain work. \u201cA hypothetical question must reflect all of a\nclaimant\u2019s impairments that are supported by the record; otherwise the question is\ndeficient and the expert's answer to it cannot be considered substantial evidence.\u201d\nChrupcala v. Heckler, 829 F.2d 1269, 1276 (3d Cir. 1987). An ALJ does not have to\ninclude every alleged impairment, but only \u201ca claimant\u2019s credibly established limitations.\u201d\n\nRutherford, 399 F.3d at 554. \u201cLimitations that are medically supported but are also\n\n4 In Paitsel\u2019s Reply Brief, she suggests that her recent analysis of job postings is\ninconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding. (D.I. 19 at 7-8). Paitsel cannot attack the finding\nabout the number and types of jobs that exist that she can do by providing the results of\nrecent internet searches.\n\n12\ncontradicted by other evidence in the record may or may not be found credible-the ALJ\ncan choose to credit portions of the existing evidence but cannot reject evidence for no\nreason or for the wrong reason.\u201d /d. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe ALJ found the opinion of Dr. Papa not persuasive as \u201coverly extreme\u201d and\nnot supported by the overall medical evidence or consistent with the record as a whole\nthat demonstrates Paitsel has moderate limitations. (D.I. 8 at 36). The ALJ found that\n\u201cthe degree of limitation expressed by Dr. Papa [/.e., marked] is not consistent with the\ntreatment records or his own mental status exams of the claimant, which indicated\nanxiety and irritability, but little other abnormalities on exam.\u201d (/d. at 36, citing id. at\n558-563, 584-612).\n\nThe ALJ is only required to include limitations found in the residual functional\ncapacity assessment in the hypothetical question. See /zzo v. Commissioner of Soc.\nSec., 186 F. App\u2019x 280, 287 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding that the ALJ did not err in failing to\ninclude in his hypothetical questions to the vocational expert \u201cspecific reference[s] to\n[the claimant's] functional loss, mental limitations, and subjective complaints of pain and\nfatigue,\u201d where the ALJ had already discredited those alleged impairments, excluding\nthem from his RFC determination); Russo v. Commissioner of Soc. Sec., 2014 WL\n6991987, at *11 (D.N.J. Dec. 10, 2014) (where \u201can ALJ has appropriately rejected a\nlimitation, that limitation need not be conveyed to the vocational expert.\u201d). In addition,\n\u201cwhere a limitation is supported by medical evidence but is opposed by other evidence\nin the record, the ALJ has the discretion to choose whether to include the limitation in\n\nthe hypothetical.\u201d Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 615 (3d Cir. 2014).\n\n13\nHere, the ALJ found the opinions of Dr. Papa not persuasive. (D.I. 8 at 36).\nThus, the evidence the ALJ analyzed did not support the limitations posed to the VE\nduring examination by Paitsel\u2019s attorney. As a consequence, the answers to those\nquestions relied upon an infirm foundation. Therefore, the ALJ was not required to\naccept the VE\u2019s testimony that no work was available that Paitsel could perform.\n\nPaitsel also argues the ALJ erred in finding that her impairments do not meet or\nequal the requirements of the listing of impairments for musculoskeletal, respiratory,\nand mental impairments. She believes she meets the criteria of Appendix 1 to subpart\nP of Part 404 \u2014 Listing of Impairments - Musculoskeletal System (1.00 and 101.00);\nRespiratory Disorders (3.00 and 103.00); Mental Disorders (12.00 and 112.00); and/or\nPart A 1.00 Musculoskeletal System (3.00), Respiratory Disorders (12.00) and Mental\nDisorder. (D.I. 14 at 4). Paitsel does not explain why she believes she meets the\nlisting requirements or why the ALJ erred in his finding.\n\nAt step three, the ALJ is required to determine whether any of a claimant's\nimpairments, alone or in combination with other impairments, meet or are medically\nequivalent to one of the impairments enumerated in the List of Impairments. While\nPaitsel believes she meets the requirements for listing of impairments for the\nmusculoskeletal system, respiratory disorders, and mental disorder, she does not\nprovide an explanation of how she meets or equals all the requirements of any Listing.\nInstead, Paitsel states in a conclusory manner that she believes she meets the listing\nrequirements. See also Sullivan v. Zebley, 493 U.S. 521, 530 (\u201cFor a claimant to show\nthat his impairment matches a listing, it must meet all of the specified medical criteria.\u201d).\n\nPaitsel cannot meet the criteria of a listing based upon her belief. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n14\n\n404.1525(d); 416.925(d) (\u201c[!]Jmpairment(s) cannot meet the criteria of a listing based\nonly on a diagnosis. To meet the requirements of a listing, [plaintiff] must have a\nmedically determinable impairment(s) that satisfies all of the criteria of the listing.\u201d).\n\nHere, the ALJ thoroughly and correctly evaluated all of Paitsel\u2019s physical and\nmental impairments and found that she does not have an impairment or a combination\nof impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed\nimpairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(d),\n404.1525, 404.1526, 416.920(d) and 416.926. (D.I. 8 at 26-27). The ALJ justifiably\nrelied upon Paitsel\u2019s medical records in finding that her rheumatoid arthritis and blurry\nvision/vision disorder were not medically determinable impairments due to a lack of\nobjective evidence. (/d. at 25-26). He considered all of Paitsel\u2019s physical impairments\nindividually and in combination, and found that the record did not establish the medical\nsigns, symptoms, laboratory findings or degree of functional limitation required to meet\nor equal the criteria of any listed impairment. (/d. at 27). As noted, the ALJ thoroughly\nreviewed Paitsel\u2019s records and provided ample reasoning in finding she did not meet the\nlisting requires for musculoskeletal system (i.e., 1.00) and for disorders of the spine (i.e.,\n1.04).\n\nWith respect to the mental listings, the ALJ found that Paitsel had moderate\nlimitations in the four areas of mental functioning for Listings 12.03, 12.06, and 12.25.\n(Id. at 27-31). To satisfy the criteria of Paragraph B, a claimant's mental disorder must\nresult in an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation of one or a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation of two of the four areas of\nmental functioning. 20 CFR Part 404, Subpt. P, App\u2019x 1 \u00a7 12.00. Paitsel did not meet\n\nthe listing requirements. The ALJ also considered whether Paragraph C criteria were\n15\n\nsatisfied and found that the evidence failed to establish the presence of Paragraph C\ncriteria as there was no evidence Paitsel\u2019s mental disorder was \u201cserious and persistent\u201d\nand evidence of marginal adjustment (i.e., she had minimal capacity to adapt to\nchanges in her environment or to demands that were not already part of her daily life).\n(Id. at 31).\n\nSimilar to the physical impairments, the ALJ provided a thorough analysis of\nPaitsel\u2019s mental impairments and the mental health records that indicate she responded\nand functioned well when on her medication, that she maintained mostly normal mental\nstatus examinations except for agitation and an anxious mood when in treatment,\nthere was no change in mental status findings or prescribed medication even when\nunder increased stress, and she had good relationships with her spouse and children.\nFinally, as discussed above, the ALJ did not find Dr. Papa\u2019s opinion persuasive as it\nwas \u201coverly extreme\u201d and not supported by the overall medical evidence or consistent\nwith the record as a whole. (/d. at 36). The ALJ found persuasive the opinion of state\nagency psychologist Dianne Bingham, Ph.D. who reviewed the treatment evidence, the\nconsultative physician's report and Paitsel\u2019s written statements and determined that\nPaitsel had no more than moderate limitations in her mental function, was stable when\ntaking her medications regularly, and was capable of \u201csimple routine work in a low\nsocial contact work environment.\u201d (/d. at 36, 85-93).\n\nThe ALJ's conclusion that Paitsel does not have an extreme impairment in one of\nthe foregoing categories or marked impairments in two of the foregoing categories is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence of record. Thus, the Court cannot conclude that\n\n16\n\nPaitsel\u2019s impairments meet or medically equal the severity of any listed mental\nimpairment.\n\nThe final responsibility for determining a claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity is\n\nreserved to the Commissioner. See Breen v. Commissioner of Soc. Sec., 504 F. App\u2019x\n96 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing 20 C.F.R \u00a7 404.1546(c)). The substantial evidence of record\nsupports the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ALJ thoroughly analyzed the medical evidence and\n\nconsidered the medical opinions in determining the effects of Paitsel\u2019s condition in\n\nrelation to her ability to perform work. The ALJ appropriately relied upon the testimony\nof the VE. In addition, the record supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that found that Paitsel\ndoes not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meet or medically\nequal the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P,\nAppendix 1 (20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(d), 404.1525, 404.1526, 416.920(d) and 416.926).\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s ruling\nand finding that Paitsel is not disabled. ,\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will: (1) deny Paitsel\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment; and (2) grant the Commissioner's cross-motion for summary\njudgment.\n\nA separate order will be entered.\n\n17\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nSUSAN PAITSEL,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 21-610-RGA\n\nKILOLO KIJAKAZI, Acting\nCommissioner of Social Security, :\n\nDefendant.\n\npb ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this Wi) day of August, 2022,\n\nThe Court having considered Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (D.|. 12)\nand Defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment (D.|. 18), as well as the papers\nfiled in connection therewith,\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1.
