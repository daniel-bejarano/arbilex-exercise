Civil Action No. 21-461-GBW \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPending before this Court is Defendants ' Partial Motion to Dismiss Second Amended \nComplaint for Patent Infringement and Stay Patent Claims Pending Inter Partes Review \nProceedings (D.I. 99), Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint (D.I. 111), \nand Rakuten, Inc.' s Renewed Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint for Patent \nInfringement Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) (D.I. 132). The Court heard oral argument on the \nabove pending motions on December 13, 2022. For the reasons below, Defendants' Partial Motion \nto Dismiss Second Amended Complaint for Patent Infringement and Stay Patent Claims Pending \nInter Partes Review Proceedings (D.I. 99) is DENIED-IN-PART and GRANTED-IN-PART; \nPlaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint (D.1. 111) is DENIED; and \nRakuten, Inc.' s Renewed Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint for Patent Infringement \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) (D.I. 132) is DENIED. \n1 I. BACKGROUND1 \nOn March 29, 2021, Plaintiff International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\") filed \nits Complaint alleging Rakuten USA, Inc., Rakuten Commerce , LLC, Ebates Inc. d/b/a Rakuten \n(\"Ebates Inc.\") and Rakuten, Inc.2 (\"Rakuten Japan\") infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,072,849 (the \n'\"849 patent\"), 7,631,346 (the '\"346 patent\"), 6,785,676 (the '\"676 patent\"), and 7,543,234 (the \n\"'234 patent\"). D.I. 1. On May 19, 2021, Rakuten USA, Inc., Rakuten Commerce , LLC, and \nEbates Inc. filed its first Motion to Dismiss. D .I. 13. IBM did not respond to the Motion to Dismiss \nand instead, on June 23, 2021, IBM filed its First Amended Complaint in which it dropped Rakuten \nUSA, Inc. and Rakuten Commerce , LLC and added Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba \nRakuten Rewards (\"Ebates Performance Marketing \"). D.I. 18. Rakuten Japan then filed a Motion \nto Dismiss the First Amended Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction . D.I. 31. The Court \ndenied Rakuten's Motion to Dismiss without prejudice \"to renew upon completion of jurisdictional \ndiscovery. \" D.I. 63. \nEbates Performance Marketing also moved to dismiss Count Six of the First Amended \nComplaint, arguing that the '443 patent was invalid. D.I. 60. IBM then filed its Second Amended \nComplaint to cite to a previously served expert report in a co-pending litigation , which opines the \n'443 patent is inventive and unconventional. D.I. 70 ,r 81. Rakuten filed a Partial Motion to \nDismiss Count Five of IBM's Second Amended Complaint but eventually withdrew the motion. \nD.I. 82; D.I. 98. \nOn April 25, 2022, Ebates Performance Marketing moved to dismiss Counts One, Three, \nand Five ofIBM's Second Amended Complaint as barred by collateral estoppel and moved to stay \n1 The Court writes for the benefit of the parties and assumes familiarity with the issues in this case. \n2 On April 1, 2021, Rakuten, Inc. changed its name to Rakuten Group, Inc. D.I. 33 ,r 5. \n2 proceedings with respect to the '346 and '234 patents in view of inter partes review (\"IPR\") \nproceedings (the \"Motion to Dismiss and Stay\"). D.I. 99. On July 15, 2022, Rakuten Japanjoined \nEbates Performance Marketing's Motion to Dismiss and Stay. D.I. 134. Briefing regarding the \nMotion to Dismiss and Stay is complete. See D.I. 100, D.I. 115, D.I. 126. \nOn May 23, 2022, IBM requested leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. D.I. 111. \nLetter briefing regarding IBM's motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint is complete. \nSee D.I. 112, D.I. 114, D.I. 117. \nOn July 15, 2022, Rakuten Japan filed a Renewed Motion to Dismiss IBM's Second \nAmended Complaint for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(2) (the \"Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction\"). D.I. 132.3 Briefing \nregarding Rakuten Japan's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction is complete. See \nD.I. 133, D.I. 150, D.I. 166. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \na. Personal Jurisdiction Under Rule 12(b)(2) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) requires the Court to dismiss any case in which \nit lacks personal jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2); E.J DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Rhodia \nFiber & Resin Intermediates, 197 F.R.D. 112, 119 (D. Del. 2000). The determination of whether \nthe court has personal jurisdiction over a party requires a two-part analysis. E.J DuPont de \n3 Rakuten Japan noted the following in its Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction: \n\"On February 16, 2022, the Court granted IBM's Unopposed Motion for Leave to File a Second \nAmended Complaint. (D.I. 68). None of the changes between the [First Amended Complaint] \n[(\"]F ACD\"] and the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") are directed at curing the jurisdictional \ndeficiencies of the FAC. Accordingly, Rakuten Japan is terming this motion as a 'renewed' motion \nto dismiss even though it is the first time Rakuten Japan is filing a motion seeking to dismiss the \nSAC.\" D.I. 132. \n3 Nemours, 197 F.R.D. at 119. First, the court must determine whether a defendant's actions fall \nwithin the scope of a state's long-arm statute. Id. Second, the court must determine whether the \nexercise of jurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. Id. \"The \nDelaware long-arm statute, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104( c ), is to be broadly construed to confer jurisdiction \nto the maximum extent possible under the Due Process Clause.\" Kabbaj v. Simpson, 547 F. App'x \n84, 86 n.6 (3d Cir. 2013) (citing LaNuova D & B, Sp.A. v. Bowe Co., 513 A.2d 764, 768 (Del. \n1986)); see also Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAlliance Pharma SA, 623 F.3d 147, 155 (3d \nCir. 2010); RMG Media, LLC v. iBoats, Inc., No. 20-290-RGA , 2021 WL 1227730, at *2 (D. Del. \nMar. 31, 2021) (citing AstraZeneca AB v. Mylan, 72 F. Supp. 3d 549,552 (D. Del. Nov. 5, 2014)). \nIn other words, the general two-part analysis of personal jurisdiction-( 1) whether a defendant 's \nactions fall within the scope of a state's long-arm statute; and (2) whether the exercise of \njurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution--collapses into a single \ninquiry of whether a court's exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with Due Process. See id. \nConstitutional due process is satisfied if \"sufficient minimum contacts exist between the \ndefendant and the forum state to satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\" \nTriStrata Tech., Inc. v. Emu/gen Labs., Inc., 537 F. Supp. 2d 635, 641 (D. Del. 2008); see also \nInt'! Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. 310,316 \n(1945). \"In undertaking this 'minimum contacts' analysis, the Supreme Court has focused on the \nnature and extent of 'the defendant's relationship to the forum State.\"' RMG Media, 2021 WL \n1227730, at *2 (quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., San Francisco Cty., \n137 S.Ct. 1773, 1779 (2017)). The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that \"defendant's \nconduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being \n4 haled into court there.\" TriStrata Tech., 537 F. Supp. 2d at 641 (citing World-Wide Volkswagen \nCorp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286,297 (1980)). \n\"The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the defendants are properly subject to \nthe court's jurisdiction.\" Nespresso USA, Inc. v. Ethical Coffee Co. SA, 263 F. Supp. 3d 498, 502 \n(D. Del. 2017). If a plaintiff makes \"factual allegations [that] suggest the possible existence of \nrequisite contacts between the defendant and the forum state with 'reasonable particularity ,\"' the \nCourt should order jurisdictional discovery. Commissariat A L 'Energie Atomique v. Chi Mei \nOptoelectronics Corp., 395 F.3d 1315, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2005); see also Mellon Bank (East) PSFS, \nNat'! Ass'n v. Farino, 960 F.2d 1217, 1223 (3rd Cir. 1992). However, \"[a]fter discovery has begun, \nthe plaintiff must sustain [its] burden by establishing jurisdictional facts through sworn affidavits \nor other competent evidence.\" Philips Electronics North America Corp. v. Contee Corp., No. 2-\n123-KAJ, 2004 WL 503602, at *3 (D. Del. Mar. 11, 2004) (citing Time Share Vacation Club v. \nAtlantic Resorts, Ltd, 735 F.2d 61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984)) (internal citations omitted). \nb. Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \nSuch a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, 342 (3d \nCir. 2022) ( quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) ( citing Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\"' Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458,462 (3d Cir. 2021) \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). But the Court will \"'disregard legal conclusions and recitals of \n5 the elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory statements.'\" Princeton Univ., 30 \nF.4th at 342 (quoting Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2016)). Under Rule \n12(b )( 6), the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and view those facts \nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Fed. Trade Comm 'n v. Abb Vie Inc, 976 F.3d 327, \n351 (3d Cir. 2020). \n'\"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. \nLitig., 804 F.3d 633, 638 (3d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). \"A motion to dismiss [under Rule \n12(b)(6)] 'may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, \nand viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' \nMcCrone v. Acme Markets, 561 F. App'x 169, 172 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997)). \nc. Collateral Estoppel \nCollateral estoppel (i.e., issue preclusion) precludes parties from relitigating an issue that \nthey previously had a full and fair opportunity to litigate. See Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. \n147, 153 (1979). Regional circuit law governs the general procedural question of whether \ncollateral estoppel applies. See ArcelorMittal At/antique et Lorraine v. AK Steel Corp., 908 F.3d \n1267, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \"However, for any aspects that may have special or unique \napplication to patent cases, Federal Circuit precedent is applicable. \" Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Zenni \nOptical Inc., 713 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). \nUnder Third Circuit law, collateral estoppel applies when \"(1) the identical issue [was] \npreviously adjudicated; (2) the issue (was] actually litigated; (3) the previous determination of the \nissue [was] necessary to the decision; and (4) the party being precluded from relitigating the issue \n6 [was] fully represented in the prior action.\" Stone v. Johnson, 608 F. App'x 126, 127 (3d Cir. \n2015); Jean Alexander Cosmetics , Inc. v. L 'Orea! USA, Inc., 458 F.3d 244, 249 (3d Cir. 2006). \n\"The Third Circuit also considers whether the party being precluded had a full and fair opportunity \nto litigate the issue in question in the prior action, and whether the issue was determined by a final \nand valid judgment.\" Sound View Innovation s, LLC v. Walmart Inc., No. 19-660-CFC-CJB , 2019 \nWL 70_67056, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 23, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, No. 19-660-\nCFC-CJB , 2020 WL 136864 (D. Del. Jan. 13, 2020) (citing Free Speech Coal, Inc. v. Attorney \nGen. of US., 677 F.3d 519, 541 (3d Cir. 2012); Jean Alexander, 458 F.3d at 249). \"The party \nseeking to effectuate an estoppel has the burden of demonstrating the propriety of its application .\" \nSuppan v. Dadonna, 203 F.3d 228,233 (3d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). \nd. Motion to Stay \nA court has discretionary authority to grant a motion to stay. See Dentsply Int 'l Inc. v. Kerr \nMfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990). Courts generally consider three factors to \ndetermine whether a stay is appropriate : (1) whether granting the stay will simplify the issues for \ntrial; (2) the status of the litigation, particularly whether discovery is complete and a trial date has \nbeen set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to suffer undue prejudice from any \ndelay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage . See Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco \nHoldings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS , 2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing \nEthicon LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., C.A. No. 17-871-LPS , 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. \nMar. 20, 2019)). Courts sometimes also consider a fourth factor-\"whether a stay, or the denial \nthereof, will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court\"-when deciding \nwhether to stay a case pending a covered business method review (\"CBM\"). Brit. Telecomm s. \nPLC v. IAC/InterActiveCorp ., 2019 WL 4740156, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 27, 2019). \"While the four-\n7 factor test that Congress enacted for stays in CBM proceedings does not expressly extend to IPR \ncases, the policy considerations that apply in the two contexts are similar, and the Federal Circuit \nhas held that the fourth factor set forth in the CBM statute may properly be applied to stays in IPR \ncases as well.\" Id. at * 3 ( citation omitted). \ne. Motion for Leave to Amend \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 provides that, apart from amendments as a matter of \ncourse, \"a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the \ncourt's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2). \"The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies within the discretion of the court.\" \nCompagrzie des Grands Hotels d'Afrique SA v. Starwood Cap. Grp. Glob. I LLC, No. 18-654-SB\u00ad\nSRF, 2021 WL 6883231, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 10, 2021) (citations omitted). \n\"Leave to amend must generally be granted unless equitable considerations render it \notherwise unjust.\" Arthur v. Maersk, Inc., 434 F.3d 196, 204 (3d Cir. 2006); see also Foman v. \nDavis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to the \namendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Arco, 921 F .2d 484, 486-87 (3d Cir. 1990). In the absence \nof undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the amendment \nshould be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non-moving party. See \nFoman, 371 U.S. at 182. An amendment is futile if it \"would fail to state a claim upon which relief \ncould be granted.\" In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997) \n( citation omitted). \"The standard for assessing futility is the 'same standard for legal sufficiency \nas applies under [Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] Rule 12(b)(6).\"' Great W Mining & Min. Co. \nv. Fox Rothschild, LLP, 615 F.3d 159, 175 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Shane v. Fauver, 213 F.3d 113, \n115 (3d Cir. 2000)). \n8 III. DISCUSSION \na. Personal Jurisdiction Under Rule 12(b )(2) \nThe parties dispute whether the Court has personal jurisdiction over Rakuten Japan. For \nthe reasons discussed below, the Court finds personal jurisdiction over Rakuten Japan is proper \nand denies Rakuten Japan's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction (D.I. 132). The \nCourt agrees with IBM's assertion that Rakuten Japan \"targeted\" this District by assigning three \npatents to Ebates Performance Marketing and having Ebates Performance Marketing file \npermissive patent infringement counterclaims in this District. \nThe Court will first provide a history of how Ebates Performance Marketing acquired the \ncounterclaim patents asserted in this action. Rakuten Japan is a Japanese corporation , with its \nprincipal place of business in Setagaya , Tokyo, Japan. D.I. 70 ,r 16. Rakuten Japan is \"the ultimate \nparent company to Ebates Performance Marketin g[.]\" Id. In July 2015, IBM informed Rakuten \nJapan that its entities were infringing certain IBM patents and asked Rakuten Japan if it would be \nwilling to enter into a licensing agreement. See D.I. 70 ,r,r 8, 126. Rakuten Japan declined. Id. \nFrom November 2016 to December 2020, Rakuten Japan acquired the '861, '968, and '960 patents \nfrom various companies . D.I. 150 at 11 (citing D.I. 151-5, Ex. 33; D.I. 151-6, Exs. 34-35, 38-40). \nOn March 29, 2021, IBM brought suit against Rakuten Japan and other Rakuten entities. D.I. 1. \nOn September 3, 2021, Rakuten Japan assigned the '861, '968, and '960 patents to Ebates \nPerformance Marketing . D.I. 150 at 12 (citing D.I. 151-5, Ex. 30 at 1). Four days later, on \nSeptember 7, 2021, Ebates Performance Marketing brought permissive patent infringement \ncounterclaims against IBM on those three patents in this District. D.I. 150 at 12 (citing D.I. 26). \nThe timing of Rakuten Japan 's transfer of the '861, '968, and '960 patents to Ebates \nPerformance Marketing and the lack of any alternative explanation for the transfer of these patents \n9 permits the Court to make a reasonable inference that Rakuten Japan intentionally assigned the \ncounterclaim patents to Ebates Performance Marketing with the intent that Ebates Performance \nMarketing would assert those patents against IBM in this action. In other words, Rakuten Japan \nused Ebates Performance Marketing to assert permissive counterclaims in this District and, thus, \npurposefully availed itself to this District. 4 \nUnder the Constitution , '\" [ s ]pecific jurisdiction is invoked when the cause of action arises \nfrom the defendant's forum related activities such that the defendant should reasonably anticipate \nbeing haled into court there.\"' Decker v. Dyson, 165 F. App'x 951, 953 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting \nVetrotex Certainteed Corp. v. Consol. Fiber Glass Products, 75 F.3d 147, 151 (3d Cir. 1996)). \n\"This has been interpreted to mean that the plaintiff must establish that the defendant has had \n'minimum contacts ' with the forum state and that the exercise of jurisdiction would comport with \n'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"' Decker, 165 F. App'x at 953 (quoting \nInt'! Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310,316 (1945)). Minimum contacts can be defined as \n\"'some act by which the defendant purposefull y avails itself of the privilege of conducting \nactivities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\"' Toys \"R\" \n4 In effect, Ebates Performance Marketing is acting as Rakuten Japan's agent. In Delaware , \"a \ndefendant company may be subject to personal jurisdiction in Delaware by virtue of the court's \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendant company's affiliate\" under the agency theory. Cephalon , \nInc. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 629 F. Supp. 2d 338,348 (D. Del. 2009). \"'[T]he court may attribute \nthe actions of a subsidiary company to its parent where the subsidiary acts on the parent's behalf \nor at the parent's direction.\"' Id (quoting C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Guidant Corp., 997 F. Supp. 556, \n559 (D. Del. 1998)). \"This theory does not treat the parent and subsidiary as one entity, but rather \nattributes specific acts to the parent because of the parent's authorization of those acts.\" Id; see \nalso Applied Biosystems , Inc. v. Cruachem , Ltd, 772 F. Supp. 1458, 1470 (D. Del. 1991) (under \nthe agency theory, \"only the precise conduct shown to be instigated by the parent is attributed to \nthe parent\"). Rakuten Japan is subject to personal jurisdiction in Delaware because Ebates \nPerformance Marketing appears to be acting on Rakuten Japan's behalf or at its direction when it \nasserted the permissive counterclaims in this action. \n10 Us, Inc. v. Step Two, SA., 318 F.3d 446, 451 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. \nSuperior Ct., 480 U.S. 102, 109 (1987)). \nHere, Rakuten Japan has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities \nwithin the forum State (Delaware). Rakuten Japan acquired property-the '861, '968, and '960 \npatents-and assigned them to its subsidiary-Ebates Performance Marketing, which is a \nDelaware corporation. D.I. 70 ~ 17. Rakuten Japan intentionally assigned those patents to Ebates \nPerformance Marketing with the intent to assert those patents as permissive counterclaims. Lastly, \nRakuten Japan used Ebates Performance Marketing to assert those patents in this action in \nDelaware. The Court finds Rakuten Japan's conduct sufficient to establish that it has minimum \ncontacts with this forum. \nThe Court also considered the following facts when deciding Rakuten Japan's Motion to \nDismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction . Rakuten Japan was \"involve[ d]\" in authenticating users \non the accused website. D.I. 150 at 7 (citing D.I. 151-1, Ex. 1 at 169:12-17 (\"Q. Okay. And the \ndistinction that I'm understanding from this -and I want to see if we're on the same page -is that \nbefore December 2021, there was involvement of rID [Rakuten ID] in authenticating users through \nthe legacy ID systems? A. Right. Involvement , yes.\")).5 Also, on www.rakuten.com's privacy \npolicy page, it states that \"[a]s long as you do not connect to another Rakuten service, your \nidentifiers ( usemame, email address, encrypted password, first name, last name and address) are \nshared only with our parent company, Rakuten Group, Inc. [Rakuten Japan], for the purposes of \noperating our authentication service.\" D.I. 46-1, Ex. 1 (emphasis added). Rakuten Japan also \nmade sales to customers in Delaware and shipped product there. D.I. 150 at 12 (citing D.I. 151-1, \n5 The \"rill\" system refers to Rakuten Japan's system, while the \"legacy ID system\" refers to Ebates \nPerformance Marketing's system. D.I. 150 at 7 n.4. \n11 Ex. 1 at 89:11-90:1 , 92:24-93:5, 94:16-24, 95:19-96:3; Ex. 2; Ex. 3); see also D.I. 133 at 9. \nRakuten Japan must approve Ebates Performance Marketing 's line items that cost over 300 million \nyen. D.I. 151-1, Ex. 10 at 64:24-65:5. Lastly, there is evidence that Rakuten Japan licenses \ncontracts with other Delaware companies on behalf of Ebates Performance Marketing and there is \nevidence that these license agreements relate to the accused instrumentalities in this case. See D.I. \n151-1, Ex. 1 at 225:12-21, 226:2-227:9, Ex. 8, Ex. 9, Ex. 10 at 79:18-21. \nThus, the Court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over Rakuten Japan, and its finding \ncomports with fair play and substantial justice under the Due Process Clause. For the reasons \nstated above, Rakuten Japan's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction is denied. \nb. Motion to Dismiss \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court finds collateral estoppel bars IBM's \ninfringement claims with respect to the '443 and '676 patents, but not with respect to the '849 \npatent. Thus, the Court grants Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counts Three and Five of IBM's \nSecond Amended Complaint and denies Defendants ' Motion to Dismiss Count One of IBM's \nSecond Amended Complaint (D.I. 99). \ni. The '443 Patent \nDefendants argue collateral estoppel bars IBM's infringement claims with respect to the \n'443 and '676 patents. D.I. 100 at 1-3, 13-16. Defendants argue that the asserted claims of the \n'443 and '676 patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. D.I. 100 at 13. Defendants point out that \nthe identical issues of invalidity were previously litigated and, thus, collateral estoppel bars IBMs \ninfringement claims for the '443 and the '676 patents. Id; see Int'! Bus. Machines Corp. v. Zillow \nGrp., Inc., No. 2-20-1130-TSZ, 2022 WL 704137, at *13 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 9, 2022) (the \"Zillow \n12 Order\"); Chewy, Inc. v. Int'! Bus.

Apr. 11, 2022) (the \"Chewy Order\"). \nOn April 11, 2022, Judge Rak.off of the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York held claims 13 and 15-17 of the '443 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n101.

On March 9, 2022, Judge Zilly of the United States District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Washington held that all claims of the '67 6 patent are invalid under 3 5 U.S. C. \u00a7 101. \nZillow Order at * 13. Judgment has been entered in favor of Zill ow with respect to the '646 patent. \nInt 'l Bus. Machines Corp. v. Zillow Grp., Inc., No. 2-20-1130-TSZ, D.I. 69 at 1-2 (Apr. 15, 2022). \nBoth the Zillow and Chewy cases are on appeal and pending before the Federal Circuit. See Int'! \nBus. Machines Corp. v. Zillow Grp., Inc., No. 22-1861 (Fed. Cir.); Chewy, Inc. v. Int'! Business \nMachines Corp., No. 2022-1756 (Fed. Cir.). \n1. Whether the previous determination was necessary to the \ndecision \nThe parties do not appear to dispute this element of collateral estoppel. See D .I. 100 at 16, \nD.I. 115 at 15-17, D.I. 126 at 2-3. For example, Judge Rak.offs determination that the '443 patent \nwas invalid under \u00a7 101 was necessary to his decision to grant Chewy's motion for summary \njudgment. Chewy Order at* 17 (\"Thus, the Court finds that the asserted claims of the '443 patent \nare invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Accordingly , the Court grants Chewy's motion for summary \njudgment of invalidity with regard to the '443 patent.\"). Likewise , Judge Zilly's determination \nthat the '67 6 patent was invalid under \u00a7 101 was necessary to his decision to grant Zillow' s motion \nto dismiss. Zillow Order at *13 (\"The '676 Patent is not valid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, and IBM's \nsecond count of patent infringement, [] is DISMISSED as failing to state a claim upon which relief \n13 can be granted.\") . Thus, the Court finds Defendants have shown the first element of collateral \nestoppel. \n2. Whether the identical issue was previously litigated \nIn this action, Defendants argue that the asserted claims of the '443 and '676 patents are \ninvalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. D.I. 100 at 13. In the Chewy case, Judge Rakoff found that claims \n13 and 15 through 17 of the '443 patent were \"invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.\" Chewy Order at \n* 17; see also id. at * 15-16. In this action, IBM alleges that Defendants infringe claims 1 through \n20 of the '443 patent. D.I.701267. Although the patent claims at issue in the Chewy case are \nnot identical to the asserted claims in this action, \"[i]t is well established that patent claims need \nnot be identical for collateral estoppel to apply.\" Google LLC v. Hammond Dev. Int'!, Inc., 2022 \nWL 17491972, at *3 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citing Soverain Software LLC v. Victoria's Secret Direct \nBrand Mgmt., LLC, 778 F.3d 1311, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2015)).6 \"Rather, collateral estoppel requires \nthat the issues of patentability be identical. \" Id. (citing Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps S., LLC, \n735 F.3d 1333, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2013)). \"If the differences between the unadjudicated patent claims \nand adjudicated patent claims do not materially alter the question of invalidity , collateral estoppel \napplies.\" Ohio Willow Wood, 735 F.3d at 1342. \nHere, the Court finds that the difference between the unadjudicated patent claims and \nadjudicated patent claims do not materially alter the question of invalidity . Judge Rakoff's \ndetermination that claims 13 and 15 through 1 7 of the '44 3 patent were invalid under \u00a7 101 equally \napplies to the other claims in the patent. In IBM's Second Amended Complaint , it alleges several \ninventive concepts of the '443 patent. D.I.701168-82 . For example, IBM alleges the '443 patent \nuses \"a computer-specific technique of 'batch processing \"' \"to improve the delivery of \n6 IBM does not provide any substantive arguments regarding this point. See generally D.I. 115. \n14 advertisements over the internet,\" \"a computer-specific technique of caching,\" the use of an \nidentifier for a user, and the use of a \"repository\" to store information used in associating search \nresults with advertisements. Id. However , the inventive concepts cited in IBM's Second Amended \nComplaint were aspects of the invention that were recited in the claims that were held invalid by \nJudge Rak off in the Chewy case. See Chewy Order at * 15-17. For example, Judge Rak off found \nthe use of a \"repository\" in the claims did not recite an inventive concept. Chewy Order at * 16 \n(\"But using a repository -which the specification defines as 'a server or wide area network,' Patent \n'443 at 6:27-29-to store the information used in associating search results with advertisements is \nnot an inventive concept. Rather, it merely encapsulates the conventional concept of storing \nadvertisement in a means compatible with the patent's abstract advertisement targeting approach. \" \n(citation omitted)) . Thus, collateral estoppel applies to the remaining claims in the '443 patent. \nSee Ohio Willow Wood, 735 F.3d at 1342. \nIBM asserts that Defendants infringe claim 14 of the '676 patent in its Second Amended \nComplaint. D.I. 70 ,r,r 210, 212. In the Zillow case, Judge Zilly specifically found that claim 14 \nof the '676 patent was \"not valid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.\" Zillow Order at *13; see also id. at *10-\n12. Thus, the identical issue of whether claim 14 of the '676 patent was invalid was previously \nadjudicated in the Zillow case. For the above reasons, the Court finds that Defendants have shown \nthe second element of collateral estoppel. \n3. Whether the issue was actually decided on the merits and the \ndecision was final and valid \nThe issue of whether the '443 and '676 patents are invalid under\u00a7 101 was decided on the \nmerits and the decision was final and valid. Both Judge Zilly and Judge Rakoff provide several \npages of analysis regarding the issue of invalidity and judgment has been entered in favor of \ndefendants based on Judge Zilly's and Judge Rakoff's resolution of the issue. See Chewy, Inc. v. \n15 Int'! Bus. Machines Corp., No. 21-1319 (JSR), D.I. 184 at 1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2022); Int'! Bus. \nMachines Corp. v. Zillow Grp., Inc., No. 2-20-1130-TSZ , D.I. 69 at 1-2 (Apr. 15, 2022). Both \ncases are subject to pending appeals. \nIBM argues that, because the Chewy and Zillow cases are subject to appeals, '\"although \nnot dispositive on the question of finality, D [it] weighs against the application of issue \npreclusion. \"' D.I. 115 at 15 (quoting Glen v. Trip Advisor LLC, 529 F. Supp. 3d 316,326 (D. Del. \n2021) (citing Sound View, 2019 WL 7067056, at *4)). \nHowever, \"the law is well settled that the pendency of an appeal has no effect on the finality \nor binding effect of a trial court's holding.\" Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. v. Mylan Pharms., Inc., 170 \nF.3d 1373, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted); Galderma Lab'ys Inc. v. Amneal Pharms., \nLLC, 921 F. Supp. 2d 278, 281 (D. Del. 2012) (same); Biogen Int'! GmbH v.

Sept. 22, 2020), appeal dismissed, No. 2021-1078 , 2022 WL 16548075 (Fed. \nCir. Oct. 31, 2022) (\"[the] judgment is no less preclusive because it was rendered by a district \ncourt rather than the Federal Circuit and the judgment's preclusive effect is in no way diminished \nbecause it is presently on appeal or because this case -where preclusion is sought -has already \nproceeded through trial.\"); DietGoal Innovations LLC v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 70 F. Supp. \n3d 808, 812 (E.D. Tex. 2014) (Bryson, J. sitting by designation) (\"the collateral estoppel effect of \na prior district court decision is not affected by the fact that an appeal has been taken from the \ndecision.\"); Huron Holding Corporation v. Lincoln Mine Operating Co., 312 U.S. 183, 189 (1941) \n(\"[I]n the federal courts the general rule has long been recognized that while appeal with proper \nsupersedeas stays execution of the judgment , it does not-until and unless reversed--<letract from \nits decisiveness and finality.\"). But see Sound View, 2019 WL 7067056, at *3 (finding a previous \n16 decision by a different court finding the asserted patent invalid under \u00a7 101 is not \"sufficiently \nfirm to be accorded conclusive effect.\") (citation omitted). \nThus, the fact that the Chewy and Zillow cases are subject to pending appeals has no effect \non the finality or binding effect of the Chewy and Zillow district court's respective holdings. For \nall these reasons, Defendants have shown the third element of collateral estoppel. \n4. Whether IBM was adequately represented in the previous \naction \nThe parties do not appear to dispute this element. See D.I. 100 at 16; D.I. 115 at 15-17. \nThere is no doubt that IBM was fully and adequatel y represented in the prior actions. In both the \nZillow and Chewy cases, IBM was represented by the same outside counsel as in this action\u00ad\nDesmarais LLP. D.I. 100 at 16. IBM, therefore , was adequately represented in the previous \nactions. Thus, the Court finds Defendants have shown the fourth element of collateral estoppel. \nIn response to Defendant 's Motion to Dismiss Counts Three and Five of IBM's Second \nAmended Complaint as barred by collateral estoppel, IBM requests the Court to stay proceedings \nrelated to the '443 and '676 patents pending the resolution of IBM's appeals. D.I. 115 at 15-17. \nThe Court will not stay proceedings related to the '443 and '676 patents. Defendants have \nestablished all of the requirements of collateral estoppel with respect to the '443 and '676 patents \nand a 'judge cannot permit relitigation because of equitable considerations .\" Mississippi Chem. \nCorp. v. Swift Agr. Chemicals Corp., 717 F.2d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1983); see also Biogen, 487 \nF. Supp. 3d at 268 (expressing \"doubts that [the district court] has discretion to decline to apply \ncollateral estoppel for equitable reasons in a case like this when all the requirements are otherwise \nmet.\"). \n17 In sum, the Court finds collateral estoppel bars IBM's infringement claims with respect to \nthe '443 and '676 patents. \nii. The '849 Patent \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count \nOne of IBM's Second Amended Complaint as barred by collateral estoppel. \nOn April 12, 2022, Judge Rakoff granted Chewy's summary judgment motion that the \nChewy accused products do not infringe claims 1-2, 14, and 18 of the '849 patent because the \naccused products did not meet the \"selectively storing\" limitation. Chewy Order at *7-9. Judge \nRakoff construed the term \"selectively storing\" to require that the \"advertising objects be 'pre\u00ad\nfetched' in the sense that they are retrieved before the user has requested the page in connection \nwith which they are to appear.\" Id. at *8. Chewy's accused products delivered \"user \nadvertisements based on a set of targeting criteria specific to the user built from information \ncollected about that user, such as his or her past history of interacting with the site or the user's \ndemographics.\" Id. at *9. Thus, Judge Rakoff found Chewy's accused products did not meet the \n\"selectively storing\" limitation. \nDefendants contend that now IBM \"accuses Ebates Performance Marketing of allegedly \npracticing the 'selectively storing' limitation of asserted claim 1 [of the '849 patent] by setting \ncache control parameters that dictate which objects are stored and for how long.\" D.l. 100 at 14 \n(citing D.I. 70 ,r,r 150, 152-53). Defendants argue that IBM is collaterally estopped from making \nthis argument because this identical issue was previously litigated. D .I. 100 at 14; see also Chewy \nOrder at *7-9. Defendants contend Judge Rakoff \"held that retrieving and storing content from a \npage requested by the user ( e.g., by setting cache control parameters that dictate when and for how \nlong objects are stored) is insufficient to practice the limitation.\" D.I. 100 at 14 (citation omitted). \n18 Thus, Defendants argue, because IBM's theory of infringement action was already rejected by \nJudge Rak:off in the Chewy case, IBM is collaterally estopped from arguing Ebates Performance \nMarketing infringes the '849 patent. D.I. 100 at 15. \nIBM responds that Defendants have failed to meet its burden that the accused products in \nthis case are essentially the same as the Chewy accused products. D.I. 115 at 9-10. \"A primary \nissue in a collateral estoppel analysis with respect to non-infringement is whether the accused \nproduct is the same.\" ArcelorMittal At/antique et Lorraine v. AK Steel Corp., 908 F.3d 1267, 1273 \n(Fed. Cir. 2018). Defensive collateral estoppel of non-infringement applies in the \"limited \ncircumstances[ ] where it is shown that a close identity exists between the relevant features of the \naccused device and the device previously determined to be [ non-]infringing\" such that they are \n\"essentially the same.\" Id. at 1274 (citing Yingbin-Nature (Guangdong) Wood Indus. Co. v. Int'! \nTrade Comm 'n, 535 F.3d 1322, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \"Accused devices are 'essentially the same' \nwhere the differences between them are merely 'colorable ' or 'unrelated to the limitations in the \nclaim of the patent.\"' Id. ( citation omitted). The proponent of issue preclusion \"bears the burden \nof showing that the accused devices are essentially the same as those in the prior litigation. \" Id. \n(citing In re Katz Interactive Call Processing Patent Litig., 639 F.3d 1303, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). \nHere, Defendants bear the burden of showing that the accused products in this case are \n\"essentially the same\" as the Chewy accused products and that the difference are merely \n\"colorable\" or \"unrelated to the limitations \" of the claims of the '849 patent. Ak Steel Corp., 908 \nF. 3d at 1274. As noted by IBM, Defendants are essentially \"asking this Court to short circuit the \ntypical infringement analysis at the very beginning of the case and conclusively decide that none \nof the Rakuten Accused Products infringe the '849 patent--even though no court has analyzed \nthose products.\" D .I. 115 at 9. The Court finds that Defendants have not met their burden. \n19 First, Defendants and Chewy are unrelated companies . See D.I. 115 at 9. Second, \nDefendants ' accused website-www.rakuten.com -looks and functions differently than Chewy's \naccused website-www .chewy.com. Id. Third, the products were developed independentl y and \nuse different source code. Id. For example, Defendant s' website and mobile application use the \nReact library and Glide framework . D.I. 115 at 11 (citing D.I. 111-3 at 45, 54). Neither the React \nlibrary nor the Glide framework were at issue in the Chewy case. See generally Chewy Order. \nThe one similarity Defendants point out between the accused products in this case and Chewy's \naccused products is the use of cache control parameters. D.I. 100 at 14. However , Defendants d id \nnot explain how or why the cache control parameter s used in the accused products in this case and \nChewy's accused products are \"essentiall y the same.\" \nIn response, Defendants cite to several cases in which courts found collateral estoppel \napplied to different accused products sharing the same relevant functionality . See D.I. 126 at 5-\n10. Defendants , however, never explained how the accused product in this case are \"essentially \nthe same.\" For example , Defendants argue: \nAnd, while IBM may argue that Ebates Performance Marketing 's accused \ninstrumentalities are not identical to Chewy's accused instrumentalities , the Federal \nCircuit and district courts have repeatedly applied collateral estoppel to \ninfringement arguments so long as the accused devices in both cases share the same \nrelevant functionality. See, e.g., ArcelorMittal, 908 F.3d at 1273 (\"Accused devices \nare 'essentially the same' where the differences between them are merely \n'colorable ' or 'unrelated to the limitations in the claim of the patent.\"'); Yufa, 629 \nF. App'x at 985-87; EON Corp, 2015 WL 4914984, at *7-9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 17, \n2015); Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Maersk Contractors USA, \nInc., 617 F.3d 1296, 1307-08, 1311-12 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Galderma , 921 F. Supp. \n2d at 281-82. \nAccordingly , the identical issues regarding the '676, '443, and '849 patents were \npreviously adjudicated. \nD.I. 100 at 15. \n20 As evidenced above, Defendants merely provide conclusionary statements that the accused \nproducts in this case are \"essentially the same\" as the Chewy accused products. See id; see also \nD.I. 126. Defendants failed to provide any specifics or analysis to show how the products are \nessentially the same.7 For the reasons stated above, the Court denies Defendants' Motion to \nDismiss Count One of IBM's Second Amended Complaint. \nc. Motion for Leave to Amend \nIBM requests the Court grants its leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. D.I. 111; see \nalso D.I. 112, 117. According to IBM, the Third Amended Complaint \"does not expand the scope \nof the litigation, but instead incorporates IBM's timely served Initial Infringement Contentions \nand succinctly provides important context for those contentions, which IBM believes will moot \nRak.uten's Third Partial Motion to Dismiss.\" D.I. 112 at 1. IBM does not propose to amend any \nof its allegations regarding the '676 and '443 patents. See, e.g., D.I. 111-7,r,r 66-74, 82-101. The \nmajority of IBM's proposed amendments relate to the '849 patent. See D.I. 111-7,r,r 149, 151, \n178-96. IBM explains that its Third Amended Complaint \"demonstrates that (1) the accused \nproducts are not the same as in prior cases [], (2) IBM is asserting claims that Rakuten did not \naddress in its motion to dismiss[], and (3) the Chewy summary judgment decision was inconsistent \n7 At oral argument, Defendants ' counsel made new arguments regarding why the Chewy accused \nproducts were essentially the same as the accused products in this case. As these arguments were \nnot made in Defendants' briefing, it is waived. See Horatio Washington Depot Techs. LLC v. \nTOLMAR , Inc., No. 17-1086-LPS, 2018 WL 5669168, at *7 (D. Del. Nov. 1, 2018), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 17-1086-LPS-CJB , 2019 WL 1276028 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2019) \n(citing Johnson-Braswell v. Cape Henlopen Sch. Dist., No. 14-1089-RGA, 2015 WL 5724365, at \n*12 n.9 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2015); L-3 Commc'ns Corp. v. Sony Corp., No. 10-734-RGA, 2014 WL \n4674815, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 12, 2014) (noting that an argument raised for the first time during \noral argument is waived)). \n21 with prior decisions in this District [].\" D.I. 117 at 2 ( citations omitted). For the reasons discussed \nbelow, the Court denies IBM's request for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. \nAs discussed above, the Court finds IBM is collaterally estopped from asserting the '443 \nand '676 patents. IBM's proposed Third Amended Complaint would be futile because IBM \ncontinues to assert infringement of two patents-the '443 and '676 patents-that have already \nbeen held invalid by other district courts. See D.I. 111-1 ,r,r 14, 226-53, 283-323; see also D.I. 114 \nat 3-5. Under Rule 15(a)(2), the \"Court must deny leave to amend if such an amendment would \nbe futile.\" Wilson v. Taylor, 466 F. Supp. 2d 567,575 (D. Del. 2006) (citing Lorenz v. CSX Corp., \n1 F.3d 1406, 1414 (3d Cir. 1993). Thus, IBM's request for leave to file its Third Amended \nComplaint (D.I. 111) is denied. \nd. Motion to Stay \nDefendants also move to stay litigation relating to the '234 and '346 patents pending their \nrespective IPR proceedings at the PTAB. D.I. 100 at 16-19. IBM opposes the motion. D.I. 115 \nat 17-20. The PT AB instituted IPRs for both patents. See Ebates Performance Marketing , Inc. \nd/b/a/ Rakuten Rewards v. International Business Machines Corp., No. IPR2022-00646 , Paper 10 \n(Oct. 25, 2022); Ebates Performance Marketing , Inc. d/b/a/ Rakuten Rewards v. International \nBusiness Machines Corp., No. IPR2022-00133 , Paper No. 9 (June 1, 2022). On balance, the Court \nfinds the stay factors weigh in favor of entering a stay pending the issuance of final written \ndecisions in the IPR proceedings related to the '234 and '346 patents. \nThe first factor-whether granting the stay will simplify the issues for trial-is neutral. If \nthe PTAB invalidates the '234 and '346 patents, then the patents would be removed from the case. \nSee D.I. 100 at 17. If the patents survive, simplification will result because estoppel would limit \nthe prior art available to Rakuten during the remainder of discovery and trial. See id IBM notes, \n22 however, that if the '234 and '346 patents are stayed, IBM's '849 patent would nevertheless \nprogress, and Defendants asserted counterclaims of infringement in this case would also progress. \nD.I. 115 at 18. Both parties make valid arguments and, thus, the first factor is neutral. \nThe second factor-the stage of the litigation-weighs in favor of a stay because \"the most \nburdensome stages of the cases--completing fact discovery , preparing expert reports, filing and \nresponding to pretrial motions, preparing for trial, going through the trial process, and engaging in \npost-trial motions practice-all lie in the future.\" IOENGINE, LLC v. PayPal Holdings , Inc., No. \n18-452-WCB, 2019 WL 3943058, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2019). In this case, fact discovery is \nongoing, expert discovery has not yet begun, and the Markman hearing has not occurred. \"[T]he \nbulk of the expenses that the parties would incur ... is still in the future.\" Id. (internal citations \nomitted). \nThe third factor-whether a stay would cause non-movant to suffer undue prejudice from \nany delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage-similarly weighs in favor of a \nstay. The parties are not direct competitors . D.I. 100 at 19; D.I. 115 at 20. Thus, IBM \"will not \nsuffer any loss of market share or erosion of goodwill due to a stay.\" IOENGINE, 2019 WL \n3943058, at *6. \nFinally, the fourth factor-whether a stay will reduce the burden of litigation-weighs in \nfavor of a stay for the reasons discussed above in the context of the second factor. \nThus, the Court grants Defendants ' Motion to Stay Proceedings for the '234 and '346 \npatents (D.I. 99). \n23 IV. CONCLUSION \nthat: Therefore, at Wilmington this 22nd day of December 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \n1. Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss Second A.mended Complaint for Patent \nInfringement and Stay Patent Claims Pending Inter Partes Review Proceedings (D.I. \n99) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART . The Court grants Defendants ' \nMotion to Dismiss Counts Three and Five of Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint \nand denies Defendants ' Motion to Dismiss Count One of Plaintiff's Second Amended \nComplaint. The litigation is stayed with respect to the '234 and '346 patents pending \nthe issuance of final written decisions in the IPR proceedings.
