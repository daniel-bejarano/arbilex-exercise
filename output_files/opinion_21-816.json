Debtors failed to repay that loan, and foreclosure proceedings were \ninitiated. Debtors filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 9, 2016 \nafter refinancing attempts failed. The Debtors thereafter filed the Adversary \nProceeding against Lender Appellees. Lender Appellees are five of the six \ndefendants in the Adversary Proceeding. 4 \nOn March 18, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order converting the \nDebtors' chapter 11 cases to chapter 7 cases (the \"Conversion Order\"). (RA520-\n522). The same day, the Office of the United States Trustee for the District of \nDelaware_ (\"UST\") appointed Don Beskrone, Esq. as the Chapter 7 Trustee for the \nDebtors' bankruptcy estates. (See B.D.I. 720). \nAppellant Rubin & Rubin, P.A. is a fictitious entity or trade name under \nwhich brothers Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin and their law firms operate. Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. is former counsel to the Debtors in the above-captioned bankruptcy \ncases and in the Adversary Proceeding. \nB. Debtors' Retention of Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \nOn December 20, 2016, Debtors filed an application to retain and employ \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. to serve as special counsel under \u00a7 3 2 7 ( e) to, among other \n4 Wells Fargo, N.A., in its capacity as Trustee for the Registered Holders of Comm \n2006-CS Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates; Berkadia Commercial \nMortgage, LLC (\"Berkadia\"); LNR Partners, LLC; Little Rock-400 West Capitol \nTrust; and Taconic Capital Advisors L.P. The sixth defendant is Somera Road, Inc. \n(\"Somera\"). \n2 things, advise Debtors regarding the foreclosure action and refinancing efforts, \n\"including the retention and management of experts for such services[.]\" (LA0045-\nLA0072) (\"Retention Application\"). In disclosing the \"principal attorneys and \nparalegals proposed to represent the Debtors,\" the Retention Application disclosed I. \nMark Rubin and Guy Rubin. (RR0 10). I. Mark Rubin, a partner at the law firm of \nRubin and Rubin, P.A., filed a verified statement in support of the Retention \nApplication. (RR020-026). The Retention Application provided, among other \nthings, that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. had not shared or agreed to share its compensation \n\"with any party or person, other than with the shareholders, counsel and associates \nof Rubin and Rubin.\" (LA0056 at ,r 32). Attorneys Mark and Guy Rubin filed \nmultiple sworn statements in support of the Retention Application repeating that \nsame averment. (See LA0070 at ,r 13; LA0612 at ,r 12.g). \nOn March 1, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving Rubin & \nRubin's retention. (LA0073-LA0076). Throughout the Bankruptcy Proceedings, \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. filed fee petitions in the name of \"Rubin & Rubin, P.A.,\" and \nthe Bankruptcy Court's related orders allowed compensation to \"Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A.\" (See LA0077-LA0188; LA0335-LA0378; LA0189-LA0248; LA0257-\nLA0331; LA03 79-LA0431; LA0432-LA0480; LA0249-LA0252; LA0253-LA0256; \nLA0332-LA0334; LA0481-LA0485). Rubin & Rubin, P.A. attorneys Mark and \nGuy Rubin also sought and obtained admission pro hac vice in the bankruptcy \nproceedings. (LA0042; LA0043; LA0044). In those pro hac vice motions, Mark \n3 and Guy Rubin signed certifications identifying their law firm as \"RUBIN AND \nRUBIN, P.A.\" (LA0042; LA0043; LA0044). \nC. Fee-Shifting Order \n1. The Show Cause Motion and Hearing \nOn June 19, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court held a status conference to address, \namong other things, certain disclosures made by Mark Rubin during his May 2019 \ndeposition concerning the entity which had filed the Retention Application-\"Rubin \n& Rubin, P.A.\" Specifically, Mark Rubin testified that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. was a \nfictitious name under which Mark and Guy Rubin and their law firms operated in \ntheir representation of the Debtors. (See LA0560). This fact was not disclosed in \nthe Retention Application, however. (See LA0045-LA0072). The Bankruptcy \nCourt therefore asked the parties to brief the \"serious issue\" of \"what representations \nwere made to the Court regarding the retention of Rubin & Rubin.\" (LA0506-\nLA0507 at 20:25-21 :5). \nA few days later, on June 25, 2019, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. filed its Application \nfor Registration of Fictitious Name with the Florida Secretary of State, which \nindicated that the owners of the fictitious name \"Rubin & Rubin, P.A.\" are Rubin \nLaw Associates, P.A. and I. Mark Rubin, P.A. {T A000 1; see also RR204 1 10). \nThe application was signed by I. Mark Rubin for IMRPA (presum~bly, I. Mark \nRubin, P.A.). (TA000l). \nOn July 1, 2019, Lender Appellees and Somera filed a Motion for Rule to \n4 Show Cause (\"Show Cause Motion\"), seeking an order for a rule to show cause why \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. should not be disqualified from serving as counsel to Debtors \nand required to disgorge its fees in connection with its failure to disclose the fee\u00ad\nsharing arrangement between I. Mark Rubin, P.A. and Guy Rubin's law firm, Rubin \nLaw Associates, P.A. (LA0541-LA0546; LA0547-LA0574). The Show Cause \nMotion further argued that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. had improperly split fees between \nI. Mark Rubin, P.A., Rubin Law Associates, P.A., and any related \"Rubin & Rubin\" \nlaw firm or attorney operating before the Bankruptcy Court under the \"Rubin & \nRubin\" trade name, in violation of the Bankruptcy Code and Rules. (LA0541-\nLA0546; LA0554, LA0568-LA0570). \nOn July 12, 2019, I. Mark Rubin filed a supplemental declaration stating that \nthe Retention Application inadvertently used \"and\" instead of\"&\" in referring to the \nname of the law firm-thus, the law firm of Rubin & Rubin, P.A. was incorrectly \nreferred to as Rubin and Rubin, P.A. (RR202 ,r 3). I. Mark Rubin further averred \nthat he works with Guy Rubin \"under the trade name Rubin & Rubin as well as \nunder the registered trade name Rubin & Rubin, P.A.\" (RR204 ,r 9). On July 22, \n2019, Guy Rubin filed a declaration stating that he is of counsel to the law firm of \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. (RR214 ,r 1). On August 23, 2019, I. Mark Rubin filed a \nsecond supplemental declaration attesting that (i) he is the sole owner and president \nof I. Mark Rubin, P.A., a law firm practicing under the fictitious name Rubin & \nRubin, P.A.; (ii) Guy Rubin is the sole owner and president of Rubin Law \n5 Associates, P.A.; (iii) the names Rubin & Rubin, P.A. and Rubin & Rubin are \nfictitious names, used respectively, by I. Mark Rubin, P.A. and Rubin Law \nAssociates, P.A., both professional associations organized under the laws of the \nState of Florida; and (iv) I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin operate under the umbrella \nof Rubin & Rubin as a partnership of their respective professional associations. \n{TA0002-0003 ). \nMark and Guy Rubin also filed declarations in support of Debtors' response \nto the Show Cause Motion in which they averred that they had not improperly \nshared fees because Rubin Law Associates, P.A. was \"of counsel\" to Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. (LA0596-LA0607; LA0608-LA0614). In other words, to avoid any \nfinding of improper fee-sharing, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. took the position that the \nattorneys and law firms acting as counsel to the Debtors operated together as a \nsingle law firm under the \"Rubin & Rubin\" trade name for purposes of the \nbankruptcy proceedings. Rubin & Rubin, P.A.'s response to the Show Cause \nMotion, and attorneys Mark and Guy Rubin's sworn statements in connection with \nthe same, confirmed that: \n\u2022 \"Mark and Guy Rubin have worked together under the Rubin & Rubin name \nfor approximately thirty years.\" {LA0581 ). \n\u2022 \"[F]or its entire life span Rubin Law Associates, P.A. has continuously \nassociated, and worked jointly, with I. Mark Rubin, P.A., and together the two \nhave jointly represented clients in hundreds of cases .... The two have held \nthemselves out as a partnership -and not as individual entities -for the past \nthirty years under the Rubin & Rubin banner.\" (Id.) \n6 \u2022 \"On its website, Rubin & Rubin, P.A., lists Guy and Mark as each being \nmembers of the firm .... As far as the public is concerned, they are both \n'Rubin & Rubin, P.A.\"' (Id.) \n\u2022 \"I [Guy Rubin] am 'of counsel to the law firm of Rubin & Rubin, P.A.\" and \n\"regularly associate with Rubin & Rubin on TIC cases,\" and Mark and Guy \nRubin's joint practice on these Bankruptcy Proceedings is a ''functional \nreality.\" (LA0609-LA0612 at ,r,r 2, 10-12 (emphasis added)). \n\u2022 \"In representing the Debtors in this matter both pre-and post-petition, Rubin \n& Rubin, P.A. has acted as a single law firm, which it is.\" (LA0604 at ,r 25 \n( emphasis added)). \n\u2022 Mark and Guy Rubin share the Rubin & Rubin office space, paralegals, a \nwebsite (which identifies Mark and Guy Rubin as both being members of the \nRubin & Rubin law firm), and an email extension and see and/or \ncommunicate with each other multiple times per day to discuss cases. \n{LA0600-LA0601at114; LA0610-LA0612119, 12; see also LA0581). \n\u2022 In cases where RLA represents clients who have retained Rubin & Rubin, \n\"Guy and his firm have acted in an 'of counsel' capacity to Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A. That is precisely the case here.\" (LA0599 at ,I 9 (emphasis added); see \nalso LA0581, LA0589, LA0591). \nThe Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Show Cause Motion on July 23, 2019 \n(\"Show Cause Hearing\"). (See LA0615-LA0678 (\"7/23/2019 Tr.\")). One of the \nDebtors' attorneys, Eric D. Freed, stated to the Court at this hearing that: \n\"[t]hroughout the course of this representation Rubin & Rubin has functioned as a \nsingle law firm. It is a single law firm.\" (Id. at 26:13-15). \n2. The Fee-Shifting Order \nOn August 9, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (LA0679-\nLA0686) finding that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. had admitted to providing the \n7 Bankruptcy Court with \"inaccurate information\" in its Retention Application and \nthat Rubin & Rubin, P.A.' s disclosures filed in support of its retention were \n\"defective\" {LA0682-LA0683). However, the Bankruptcy Court found that no \nimpermissible fee-sharing occurred between I. Mark Rubin, P.A. and Rubin Law \nAssociates, P.A. (See LA0685-LA0686). The Bankruptcy Court relied on Mark \nand Guy's repeated sworn statements and found that \"the two firms operating as \nRubin & Rubin are for all intents and purposes a partnership\" with Mark and Guy \nRubin \"operating under the [Rubin & Rubin] umbrella.\" (Id.) The Bankruptcy \nCourt therefore ordered Rubin & Rubin, P.A. to correct its Retention Application \ndisclosures \"to provide full and accurate information\" and to \"pay the Defendants' \nattorneys' fees and costs in bringing [the Show Cause] Motion\" (the \"Fee-Shifting \nSanction\"). (Id.) \nOn August 23, 2019, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. filed a motion for reconsideration \nof the Fee Shifting Sanction (LA0687-LA0708) (\"Reconsideration Motion\"), \narguing that the Fee-Shifting Sanction was not authorized because of a \"lack of due \nprocess provided\" and that the Bankruptcy Court was not authorized to assess the \nFee-Shifting Sanction pursuant to its inherent authority absent a finding of bad faith \nor deliberate misconduct. (LA0690-LA0695). Rubin & Rubin, P.A. did not \nchallenge the Bankruptcy Court's ruling that Mark and Guy Rubin, and their law \nfirms, had operated jointly under the \"Rubin & Rubin umbrella\" (which is not \nsurprising, because Mark and Guy Rubin advocated for that very ruling). (See id.) \n8 Following briefing on the Reconsideration Motion {LA0709-LA0732; \nLA0733-LA0738), the Bankruptcy Court partially granted Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \nrelief on October 19, 2019 {LA0739-LA0746), acknowledging that it could not \nimpose the Fee-Shifting Sanctions pursuant to its inherent authority absent a finding \nof bad faith or deliberate misconduct. However, the Bankruptcy Court imposed the \nsame Fee-Shifting Sanction against Rubin & Rubin, P.A. under \u00a7 105 of the \nBankruptcy Code ( and, in the alternative, under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy \nProcedure 9011). {LA0739-LA0746). The Bankruptcy Court also rejected Rubin & \nRubin, P.A.'s argument that it was not afforded due process, noting that \"[e]very \nissue relevant to the Court's imposition of sanctions was addressed in the [Show \nCause Motion] briefing and at the July 23rd hearing,\" and Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \n\"had ample notice and opportunity to be heard on the issues relevant to the \nsanctions.\" (LA0743-LA0744). \nOn October 23, 2019, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. filed a motion for clarification of \nthe Reconsideration Order (Adv. D.I. 322) (\"Clarification Motion\"), in which its \nsole request was that the Bankruptcy Court permit Rubin & Rubin, P.A. to pay the \nFee-Shifting Sanction after the final disposition of the Adversary Proceeding. On \nSeptember 4, 2020, at the close of the Adversary Proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court \nentered an order (LA0020) (\"Fee-Shifting Order\"), directing Rubin & Rubin, P.A. to \npay the Fee-Shifting Sanction \"within thirty days from the entry of this {Fee\u00ad\nShifting Order}.\" (Id. (emphasis in original)). Rubin & Rubin, P.A. filed an appeal \n9 of the Fee-Shifting Order on September 18, 2020. (Civ. Nos. 20-1260 (CFC), 20-\n1261 (CFC), 20-1262 (CFC), 20-1266 (CFC), and 20-1267 (CFC) (together, \"Prior \nAppeals\")). Rubin & Rubin, P.A. did not seek a stay of the Fee-Shifting Order \npending the Prior Appeals. Rubin & Rubin, P.A. ignored the Fee-Shifting Order \nand did not pay. \nD. Disqualification Order \nOn January 30, 2020, the UST filed a Motion to Revoke or Terminate \nRetention of Rubin and Rubin, P.A. and Disallow Fees and Expenses of Rubin and \nRubin, P.A. and Seth Denison (LA0753-LA0790) (\"Disqualification Motion\"). The \nUST argued that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. violated the Bankruptcy Rules and Code by, \namong other things: ( 1) failing to disclose multiple fee-sharing agreements with a \nthird-party broker, Mr. Seth Denison ( \"Denison Fee-Sharing Agreements\"); (2) \nfiling false and materially deficient sworn statements concerning the existence of \nany fee-sharing agreements; and (3) partially performing one of the Denison Fee\u00ad\nSharing Agreements from the Debtors' debtor-in-possession financing account \nwithout notice or court approval. (Id.) The UST also argued that Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A.' s retention should be revoked or terminated and that Rubin & Rubin, P.A.' s \nfees and expenses should be disallowed. (Id.) \nLender-Appellees field a joinder and reply in support of the Disqualification \nMotion (\"Joinder\") setting forth certain additional bases for the relief sought in the \nDisqualification Motion. (LA0791-LA0817; LA0844-LA0870). The parties, \n10 including Appellant, had the opportunity to and did file lengthy briefs addressing the \nDisqualification Motion and the Joinder. (LA0818-LA0832; LA0833-LA0843; \nLA0871-LA0891; LA0892-LA0959). \nThe Disqualification Motion and Joinder argued that both Mark and Guy \nRubin (and their associated law firms) should be held jointly liable for the violations \naddressed in the Disqualification Motion and Joinder. In the Joinder, Lender \nAppellees argued that Guy Rubin should not be permitted to distance himself and \nhis firm from Mark Rubin and his firm in connection with the Disqualification \nMotion and the issues raised therein. (LA0801-LA0803 at ,r,r 30-33). Lender \nAppellees based this argument on the fact that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. had, in \nconnection with the Show Cause Motion, submitted briefing and sworn statements \nconfirming that Mark and Guy Rubin and their law firms were retained jointly and \noperated jointly in the bankruptcy proceedings under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. trade \nname. (Id.) \nIn its opposition, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. responded to this argument by \naffirmatively representing that it was not arguing that the individuals and/or law \nfirms operating as Rubin & Rubin, P.A. (including Mark and Guy Rubin and their \nindividual law firms) should be assessed separately for purposes of the \nDisqualification Motion and/or Order. (LA0881 at ,r 24 (\"the Lender Defendants \nspeculate -again -that Rubin & Rubin will respond to the Motion and the Joinders \nby attempting to separate the firm. No such 'tactic' has been deployed in response \n11 to the Motion, or in response to the Joinders. . . . If any cause exists for the Court to \nimpose any remedy upon one or more counsel, or the firm as a whole, or to revoke \nthe pro hac vice privilege to appear before this Court, Rubin & Rubin is confident \nthis Court will appropriately assess responsibility where it belongs .... \nAccordingly, there is no need to further respond to this portion of the Joinder\") \n( emphasis added). Rubin & Rubin, P.A. therefore conceded that all firms and \nindividuals operating under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. trade name would be subject to \nany order on the Disqualification Motion. (See id.) \nOn July 29 and 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court held a two-day evidentiary \nhearing on the Disqualification Motion (LA0960-LA1326; LA1327-LA1525) \n(\"Disqualification Hearing\"). On September 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered \nthe Disqualification Order finding, among other things, that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \nviolated the Bankruptcy Rules and Bankruptcy Code by, among other things, \nmaking false and/or materially deficient disclosures to the court, entering into and \npartially performing a post-petition fee-sharing agreement with Mr. Denison, and \nfiling false declarations in connection with its retention as counsel to Debtors. \n(LA0040-LA0041 ). Based on these findings, the court disqualified Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A. from acting as counsel to the Debtors; ordered Appellant to, within 30 days \n(i.e., on or before October 4, 2020), disgorge all fees and expenses paid or to be \npaid to it in connection with its representation of the Debtors; and ordered Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. to refund, within 30 days (i.e., on or before October 4, 2020), the \n12 Debtors for amounts paid to Mr. Denison in partial satisfaction of its improper fee \nsharing agreement in the amount of $11,400 (\"Denison Refund\"). (LA0041 ). \nOn September 18, 2020, as part of the Prior Appeals, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \nappealed the Disqualification Order. (See LA1526-LA1552; LA1553-LA1579). \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. did not seek a stay of the Disqualification Order pending the \nappeal. Rubin & Rubin, P.A. ignored the Disqualification Order and did not pay. \nE. Contempt Order \nMore than seven months later, on April 28, 2021, Lender Appellees filed a \nMotion for a Rule to Show Cause Why Rubin & Rubin Should Not Be Ordered to \nComply Immediately With Two Court Orders It Has Violated Or, If It Does Not So \nComply, Be Held in Contempt of Court (LA1580-LA1618) (\"Contempt Motion\") \ndue to Rubin & Rubin's failure to comply with the payments required under the Fee\u00ad\nShifting Order and Disqualification Order ( collectively the \"Prior Orders\"). Lender \nAppellees requested that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. be ordered to show cause why it \nshould not be ordered to immediately comply with the Prior Orders, or if it does not \nso comply, be held in contempt of court for its violation of the Prior Orders. \n(LA1580-LA1618). Consistent with the Prior Orders, the proposed form of \nContempt Order made clear that Rubin & Rubin, P.A., referred to therein as \"Rubin \n& Rubin,\" \"includes I. Mark Rubin, P.A., Rubin Law Associates, P.A., Guy Bennett \nRubin, P.A., I. Mark Rubin, Guy Rubin, and any other law firm or individual \noperating under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. trade name.\" (LA 15 81 at n. 1.) \n13 Rubin & Rubin, P.A. received notice of the Contempt Motion and filed a \nresponse thereto {LA1619-LA1685), and Lender Appellees filed a reply {LA1686-\nLA1698). In its response to the Contempt Motion, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. did not \ndispute that it had failed to comply with both of the Prior Orders. Rather, Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. argued that: ( 1) the relief requested in the Contempt Motion was \nprecluded by the divestiture rule; (2) the requisite elements for contempt had not \nbeen met; and (3) Lender Appellees lacked standing. (Id.) Rubin & Rubin, P.A.' s \ndivestiture rule argument relied on a novel assertion that the meaning of the term \n\"Rubin & Rubin, P.A.,\" as used in the Prior Orders, was ambiguous. Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. further argued that the Contempt Motion sought to improperly \"expand \nthe scope of liability\" under the Prior Orders \"from Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \"-a \nfictitious trade name-\"to I. Mark and Guy Rubin individually and to any firm or \nindividual associated with them.\" {LA1626 at ,I 26(b)). Appellant would later argue \nthis was improper as \"[i ]t was Rubin & Rubin, P.A. that was retained [by the \nDebtors] and not the attorneys individually.\" {LA0004-0019 (\"5/25/21 Tr.\") at \n15 :24-16:2). Thus, Rubin & Rubin, P.A.' s divestiture argument included a separate \nargument that the Bankruptcy Court had not previously ruled that the words \"Rubin \n& Rubin, P.A.\" encompass Mark and Guy Rubin and their respective law firms\u00ad\nwhich the Bankruptcy Court had already ruled at Mark and Guy Rubin's request. \nOn May 25, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Contempt \nMotion. At the hearing, counsel admitted that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. had failed to \n14 pay the funds required by the Prior Orders, but put forth no evidence as to its failure \nto comply. (Id. at 16:17-22). Rubin & Rubin, P.A. took the position that the \nContempt Motion requested only an order directing Rubin & Rubin, P.A. to show \ncause for its noncompliance, and that a second substantive or evidentiary hearing \nwas required. (Id. at 17:23-19:9). The Bankruptcy Court disagreed, stating that the \nContempt Motion sought \"a rule to show cause why Rubin & Rubin should not be \nordered to immediately comply with those orders, and if they do not do so, to hold \nthem in contempt of court.\" (Id. at 29:5-15). \nThe Bankruptcy Court rejected as \"completely frivolous\" Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A.' s argument that the Lender Appellees did not have standing to bring the \nContempt Motion. (Id. at 31 :20-23). The court also rejected any argument that its \nPrior Orders were ambiguous because they apply to \"Rubin & Rubin, P.A.,\" stating: \n\"Mark and Guy Rubin and their individual law firms operate and operated \nthroughout this case under the fictitious trade name Rubin & Rubin, P.A.\" (Id. at \n29:24-30:4). The Bankruptcy Court found that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. did not seek \nany clarification prior to the Contempt Motion \"because they know perfectly well \nwhat the [Prior Orders] mean[].\" (Id. at 30:20-31: 1 ). Accordingly, the Bankruptcy \nCourt ruled that the Prior Orders \"can and will be enforced as written.\" (Id. at 31 :6-\n18). \nOn May 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Contempt Order \nmemorializing its ruling at the Contempt Hearing. The Contempt Order found \n15 Rubin & Rubin, P.A. to be in contempt of court and ordered: ( 1) Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A. to pay the amounts due pursuant to the Prior Orders by 4 P .M. prevailing \neastern time on June 3, 2021 (\"Deadline\"); and (2) should Rubin & Rubin, P.A. fail \nto do so, to pay the sum of $1,000 per day to the Debtors' estates until the Contempt \nOrder is fully and finally satisfied. (LA0002). \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. did not comply with the Contempt Order by the \nDeadline or anytime thereafter. On June 3, 2021, the Chapter 7 Trustee received a \nletter from Guy Bennett Rubin of Rubin Law Associates, P.A. d/b/a Rubin & Rubin \nand a check in the amount of$10,648.73-a small fraction of the Disgorged Fees\u00ad\n\"representing all funds that were received from Rubin & Rubin, P.A. and traceable \nto fee applications approved by the Bankruptcy Court and paid by the Debtors in \nconnection with legal services performed by Rubin Law Associates, P.A.\" \n{TA0052-0053). The letter purports to submit the funds to the Trustee \"to be held in \ntrust\" pending the appeals of the Prior Orders-a remedy which the Prior Orders \nneither permit nor require. (LAI 709-LAl 710). \nOn June 3, 2021, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. commenced a timely appeal of the \nContempt Order. {LA1699-LA1705). On June 8, 2021, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. filed \nits Stay Motion arguing that its compliance with the Contempt Order should be \nstayed pending appeal on the basis of irreparable harm, including its own possible \nbankruptcy. On September 27, 2021, the appeal of the Contempt Order was fully \nbriefed. (D.I. 25, 27, 32, 33). \n16 F. The Opinion and Order Affirming the Prior Orders \nTwo days later, on September 29, 2021, this Court issued an Order and \naccompanying Opinion affirming the Prior Orders. In re NNN Capitol Center 16 \nLLC, et al., 632 B.R. 243 (D. Del. 2021) (\"Opinion\"). \nII. Standard of Review \nThe bankruptcy court's legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and its \nfactual findings are reviewed for clear error. In re Marvel Entm 't Grp., Inc., 140 \nF.3d 463, 470 (3d Cir. 1998). A finding is clearly erroneous if it either is \ncompletely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of \ncredibility or bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data. \nFellheimer, Eichen & Braverman, P.C. v. Charter Techs., Inc., 57 F.3d 1215, 1223 \n(3d Cir. 1995). \"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the \nfactfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson v. City of \nBessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985). \nA court abuses its discretion where its decision \"rests upon a clearly \nerroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law, or an improper application of \nlaw to fact.\" Marvel, 140 F.3d at 470 (internal quotation omitted). \"Under the \ndeferential abuse of discretion standard,\" a decision can only be reversed if\"no \nreasonable person would adopt the [bankruptcy] court's view.\" In re VistaCare \nGrp., LLC, 678 F .3d 218, 232 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation omitted). \n17 III. DISCUSSION \nA. The Bankruptcy Court Had Jurisdiction to Enter the Contempt \nOrder \nThe Bankruptcy Court held that the divestiture rule did not apply to the \nContempt Motion because that motion merely sought to enforce the Bankruptcy \nCourt's Prior Orders as written. (Id. at 31 :6-13 ). The Court agrees. \n\"The correct statement of the Divestiture Rule is that so long as the lower \ncourt is not altering the appealed order, the lower court retains jurisdiction to \nenforce it.\" In re Wash. Mut. Inc., 461 B.R. 200,219 (Bankr. D. Del. 2011) vacated \nin part on other grounds, 2012 WL 1563880 (Bankr. D. Del. Feb. 24, 2012)); In re \nCampanile, 2019 WL 968095, at *2 (Bankr. D.N.J. Feb. 25, 2019) (confirming that \nunder the divestiture rule, \"a bankruptcy court retains authority to consider a \nrequest\" and to \"enforce\" the \"appealed order\" \"while an appeal is pending so long \nas it is not altering the appealed order\"); In re Sabine Oil & Gas Corp., 548 B.R. \n674, 679-80 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2016) (confirming that the divestiture rule does not \npreclude a bankruptcy court from enforcing its orders but instead is only implicated \nwhen the bankruptcy court \"tamper[ s ]\" in some way with the appealed order). \n1. The Divestiture Rule Does Not Apply \nThe sole basis for Appellant's divestiture rule argument is that Footnote 1 of \nthe Contempt Order defining \"Rubin & Rubin\" somehow \"expanded the scope\" of \nthe Prior Orders. (D.I. 25 at 17-28). Both of the Prior Orders unambiguously \n18 provide that they apply to \"Rubin & Rubin.\" Footnote 1 of the Contempt Order \ndefines \"Rubin & Rubin, P.A.\" as \"I. Mark Rubin, P.A., Rubin Law Associates, \nP.A., Guy Bennett Rubin, P.A., I. Mark Rubin, Guy Rubin, and any other law firm \nor individual operating under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. trade name.\" (LA0002). \nIn 2019-before the Prior Orders were entered-the Bankruptcy Court \naccepted Mark and Guy Rubin's arguments and sworn averments that \"Rubin & \nRubin\" encompasses both Mark and Guy Rubin and their affiliated law firms. \n(LA0685-LA0686). That ruling was law of the case when the Prior Orders were \nentered and during the Contempt Hearing. See In re AmeriServe Food Distribution, \nInc., 315 B.R. 24, 36 (Bankr. D. Del. 2004). Indeed, in the initial Fee-Shifting \nOrder (LA0679-LA0686), the Bankruptcy Court made clear findings as to what \nindividuals and/or entities operated under the fictional name Rubin & Rubin, P.A.: \nGiven the unusual nature of the facts in this case, the [Bankruptcy] \nCourt is tasked with making a determination on the relationship \nbetween the attorneys and entities under the Rubin & Rubin umbrella. \nAfter a review of the record, the [Bankruptcy] Court has determined \nthat the primary attorneys operating under the umbrella are Guy \nRubin and I. Mark Rubin, and their respective individually owned \nfirms, Rubin Law Associates, P.A. and I. Mark Rubin, P.A. \n(LA0685) ( emphasis added). Thus, the footnote in Contempt Order-that \"Rubin & \nRubin\" included Mark and Guy Rubin and the other affiliated law firms and \nindividuals operating under the \"Rubin & Rubin\" tradename---<loes not in any way \nalter the meaning of either of the Prior Orders. The Bankruptcy Court merely used a \n19 definition that was consistent with a prior ruling it had made as to what \"Rubin & \nRubin\" encompassed (at Mark and Guy Rubin's urging). \nThe record compels these findings and the scope of the Contempt Order. \nWhile Appellant now claims that I. Mark Rubin, P.A. is the only entity that operates \nunder the trade name Rubin & Rubin, P.A. (D.I. 25 at 28), the pleadings and sworn \ndeclarations submitted in the bankruptcy cases tell a very different story and support \nthe Bankruptcy Court's prior determination: \n\u2022 The Retention Application listed I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin as principal \nattorneys of Rubin & Rubin, P.A. (RR0l0). \n\u2022 Guy Rubin submitted a sworn declaration that he is of counsel to Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. (RR214). \n\u2022 Mark Rubin submitted a sworn declaration that he and Guy Rubin work \ntogether under the trade name Rubin & Rubin as well as under the registered \ntrade name Rubin & Rubin, P.A. (RR204 ,I 9). \n\u2022 Mark Rubin submitted a sworn declaration that the names Rubin & Rubin, \nP.A. and Rubin & Rubin are fictitious names, used respectively, by I. Mark \nRubin, P.A. and Rubin Law Associates, P.A., both professional associations \norganized under the laws of the State of Florida. (TA000313). \n\u2022 Mark Rubin submitted a sworn declaration that I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin \nare practicing attorneys and operate under the umbrella of Rubin & Rubin as a \npartnership of their respective professional associations. (TA0003 1 4 ). \n\u2022 Rubin & Rubin, P.A. filed an Application for Registration of Fictitious Name \nwith the Florida Secretary of State, which indicated that the owners of the \nfictitious name are Rubin Law Associates, P.A. and I. Mark Rubin, P.A. \n(TA000l). \n20 Thus, it is clear from the record that I. Mark Rubin, P.A., Rubin Law Associates, \nP.A. and their owners -I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin, respectively -are the entities \nand individuals behind Rubin & Rubin. \nMoreover, as the Chapter 7 Trustee correctly points out (D.I. 29 at 13), these \nare the very individuals and entities who charged the Debtors' estates and received \nthe payments that are subject to the Prior Orders. The record reflects that I. Mark \nRubin and Guy Rubin both billed the bankruptcy estates on behalf of Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. as special corporate and litigation counsel to the Debtors. (See, e.g., \nB.D.I. 185 (first interim fee application of Rubin & Rubin, P.A.). In fact, Rubin \nLaw Associates, P.A. received some of the money that was paid by the Debtors to \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. (D.I. 25 at 30 n.7 (acknowledging that the initial wire from \nthe Debtors went to Rubin & Rubin, P.A., but then Rubin & Rubin, P.A. issued a \ncheck to Rubin Law Associates, P.A.). Following entry of the Contempt Order, Guy \nRubin of Rubin Law Associates, P.A. d/b/a Rubin & Rubin returned money to the \nTrustee that it received from Rubin & Rubin, P.A. (paid by the Debtors) in \nconnection with legal services performed by Rubin Law Associates, P.A. (TA0052-\n0053). Because I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin are the sole owners and presidents of \nI. Mark Rubin, P.A. and Rubin Law Associates, P.A., respectively, it only follows \nthat the money paid by the Debtors ultimately went to those individuals. (See \nT A0002 ,r,r 1, 2; see also LA0685 (\"The [Bankruptcy] Court concludes that the two \nfirms operating as Rubin & Rubin are for all intents and purposes a partnership, with \n21 fee sharing among its partners, I. Mark Rubin, P.A. and Rubin Law Associates, \nP.A.\"). As such, Rubin & Rubin, P .A-as well as the individuals and entities \nbehind Rubin & Rubin, P.A.-should be required to pay the Fee-Shifting Sanction \nas well as the fees they previously received from the Debtors, either directly or \nindirectly, and that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. was ordered to disgorge under the \nDisqualification Order. That is precisely the relief the Contempt Order directed\u00ad\nrelief in line with prior determinations of the Bankruptcy Court and consistent with \ndisclosures made by Rubin & Rubin, P.A. in the bankruptcy cases. The fact that the \nPrior Orders did not include some kind of clarifying footnote does not change the \nresult. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court rejects Appellant's argument that Footnote \n1 of the Contempt Order expanded the scope of liability set forth in the Prior Orders. \n2. Appellant's Remaining Arguments Lack Merit \nAppellant argues that it was factual error for the Bankruptcy Court to \nconclude that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. is a fictitious entity. (D.I. 25 at 25). As an \ninitial matter, the Court agrees with Lender Appellees that this an incredible \nargument for Appellant to make given its specific and repeated representations to \nthe Bankruptcy Court that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. is a fictitious entity comprised of \nseparate law firms. (See LA0581; LA0589; LA0591; LA0599 at ,I 9; LA0600-\nLA0601 at ,I 14; LA0604 at ,f 25; LA0609-LA0612 at ,r,r 2, 10-12; LA0622 at \n26:13-15; TA000l-0002). In addition to Mark and Guy Rubin's many sworn \n22 averments, Appellant's counsel conceded during the Contempt Hearing that (1) \nRubin & Rubin is a fictitious name comprised of separate law firms; and (2) Guy \nand Mark Rubin had advocated before the Bankruptcy Court for a finding that they \nboth operated jointly under the Rubin & Rubin tradename. (LA008 at 13:11-14:4, \n15:15-17). It would not be \"reversible error\" for the Bankruptcy Court to adopt \nRubin & Rubin, P.A.' s stated positions. In any event, because there was no factual \nfinding by the Bankruptcy Court in the Contempt Order that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \nis a fictitious entity, there can be no factual error for this Court to revisit, let alone \nconsider on appeal. \nAppellant also asserts that the Bankruptcy Court \"previously acknowledged\" \nthat Guy Rubin's law firms, Rubin Law Associates, P.A. and Guy Bennett Rubin \nP.A. are \"legally distinct from I. Mark Rubin, P.A.\" (D.I. 25 at 28). Appellant \nappears to make this assertion to support its position that Rubin Law Associates, \nP .A, and Guy Bennett Rubin P.A. are not included under the so-called \"Rubin & \nRubin umbrella.\" (Id.) Appellant's assertion is misleading. The Bankruptcy Court \nruled that, although Mark and Guy Rubin's individual law firms (including Rubin \nLaw Associates, P.A. and I. Mark Rubin, P.A.) were distinct, they all operated \nunder the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. tradename in their representation of the Debtors. \n(LA0685-LA0686). \nAppellant further argues that Footnote 1 in the Contempt Order \"pierced the \ncorporate veil of all distinct legal entities operating under the 'Rubin & Rubin \n23 umbrella' and imposed personal liability on all 'individual( s) operating under the \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. trade name.\"' (D.I. 25 at 23 (emphasis in original); see also id \nat 26-29). But Footnote 1 merely made clear that which the Bankruptcy Court had \nalready found years prior. I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin shared office space and \nco-owned the furniture, equipment and office supplies in their shared space. \n(RR216). They both used the website www.RubinandRubin.com and the domain \nname@RubinandRubin.com for their email addresses. (RR205-206). The fictitious \nname Rubin & Rubin, P.A. is owned by both Rubin Law Associates, P.A. and I. \nMark Rubin, P.A., who, in tum, are solely owned by Guy Rubin and I. Mark Rubin, \nrespectively. {TA0002-0003 ,r,r 1-3; TA0052-0053). I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin \nadmitted to working together under the trade name Rubin & Rubin, P.A. (RR204 ,r \n9; see also RR2 I 3 ,r 2). Accordingly, there was a complete lack of corporate \nseparateness. As such, this is not a situation where the court sua sponte pierced the \ncorporate veil to disregard the existence of a corporation to make the individual \nprincipals liable for the debts of the corporation. See Trustees of Nat'/ Elevator \nIndus. Pension, Health Benefit and Educ. Funds v. Lutyk, 332 F.3d 188, 192 (3d Cir. \n2003). Rather, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. and I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin are \nessentially one and the same. (See, e.g., D.I. 25 at 25 (referencing deposition \ntestimony ofl. Mark Rubin where he stated that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \"does not \nexist as a separate entity but is merely a trade name\")). \n24 Appellant asserts that the Bankruptcy Court \"through judicial fiat, pierced the \ncorporate veil\" of the firms operating under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. trade name. \nBut as stated above, the Prior Orders always applied to the individuals and law firms \nthat chose to and did operate in the bankruptcy proceedings under the Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. trade name, and this argument is nothing more than an attempt to \nrelitigate the Prior Orders, which is not proper during a contempt proceeding-much \nless in an appeal of a contempt proceeding. See Harris v. City of Phi/a., 41 F.3d \n1333, 1337 (3d Cir. 1995) (the validity of an underlying order is \"not open to \ncollateral attack in a contempt proceeding for violating it\"). Moreover, Rubin & \nRubin, P.A. is a trade name, not a corporate entity. Accordingly, there was no \n\"corporate veil\" to be pierced. (Id.) \nAppellant insists that the inclusion of \"any other law firm or individual \noperating under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. trade name\" in Footnote 1 of \nthe Contempt Order \"impermissibly expanded the scope of liability over entities \nand individuals that have not appeared before [the Bankruptcy Court], that never \nrendered services to the Debtors, never participated in any of the acts and \nomissions forming the basis for the sanctions, and over which [the Bankruptcy \nCourt] has no jurisdiction.\" (D.I. 25 at 29) ( emphasis added). Reading \"operating \nunder\" as broadly as possible, Appellant apparently believes this language \neffectively imposes joint and several liability on all counsel, associates, paralegals \n25 and secretaries of the respective firms. (Id.) That is not the case. The language \nsays \"operating under\"-not employed by or associated with. Given the shell game \nplayed by Rubin & Rubin, P.A. throughout the bankruptcy cases, this catch-all \nlanguage was intended to capture any other individuals or entities (in addition to I. \nMark Rubin, P.A., Rubin Law Associates, P.A., I. Mark Rubin and Guy Rubin) that \nmay have received funds from the Debtors ( either directly or indirectly through \nRubin & Rubin, P.A.) in connection with legal services provided to the Debtors. \nFinally, Appellant continues to argue that only Rubin & Rubin, P.A. received \nfunds from the Debtors. (D.1. 25 at 3, 29 n.6, 30). While Rubin & Rubin, P.A. may \nbe the only \"entity\" that received funds directly from the Debtors, we know from I. \nMark Rubin's sworn testimony that it is a fictitious entity. Thus, Appellant's \nargument does not paint the entire picture. And making clear that disgorgement \napplies to all falling under the Rubin & Rubin, P.A. umbrella is consistent with the \nstatutory remedies available to the Chapter 7 Trustee under Chapter 5 of the \nBankruptcy Code to recover property of the estate. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542 (setting \nforth affirmative obligation to turnover property of the estate),\u00a7 550 (setting forth \nremedy to recover property of the estate). \nB. The Contempt Order Did Not Violate Due Process \nSection 105 of the Bankruptcy Code gives bankruptcy courts authority to find \nparties in civil contempt. See In re Vaso Active Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 514 B.R. \n416,421 (Bankr. D. Del. 2014); In re Cont'! Airlines, Inc., 236 B.R. 318,331 \n26 (Bankr. D. Del. 1999) ajfd sub nom. In re Cont'! Airlines, 2000 WL 1425751 (D. \nDel. Sept. 12, 2000) ajfd sub nom. In re Cont'! Airlines, Inc., 219 F.3d 226 (3d Cir. \n2002). To establish that a party is liable for civil contempt, a plaintiff must establish \nthree elements by clear and convincing evidence: (i) a valid order of the court \nexisted, (ii) the defendant had knowledge of the order, and (iii) the defendant \ndisobeyed the order. Vaso Active Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 51 B.R. at 422. All of the \nelements were met, and Appellant does not allege otherwise.5 Rather, Appellant \nasserts it was not afforded an opportunity to present defenses to its non-compliance \nwith the Prior Orders. (D.I. 25 at 31 ). This argument is belied by the record. \nThe record reflects that counsel for Rubin & Rubin, P.A. received adequate \nnotice of the Contempt Motion by CM/ECF notification, electronic mail, and first \nclass mail. Appellant had an opportunity to respond and filed a written objection \nwith the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, counsel for Rubin & Rubin, P.A. appeared \nat the hearing on the Contempt Motion. Thus, Appellant had multiple opportunities \nto present evidence and defenses in support of its noncompliance, but chose not to \ndo so. Instead, Appellant twice made a deliberate and strategic choice to address \n5 Appellant also argued below that the Prior Orders were somehow ambiguous. \nBecause Appellant abandoned that argument on appeal, it is waived. See \nPrometheus Radio Project v. Fed. Commc 'ns Comm 'n, 824 F.3d 33, 53 (3d Cir. \n2016) (an argument not raised in an appellant's opening brief is waived). In any \nevent, the Sanctions Orders were clear and unambiguous for all the reasons set forth \nabove. \n27 only why no order to show cause should issue-once in its written response and \nagain at the hearing. (See D.I. 25 at 32). \nAppellant seeks to shift blame to the Lender Appellees and the Bankruptcy \nCourt. (D.I. 25 at 32-35). While Lender Appellees were required to submit a \nproposed form of order with the Contempt Motion, the Bankruptcy Court was not \nhamstrung to the relief sought in the proposed form of order, and the court routinely \nenters orders different from the proposed orders submitted with motions. Even so, \nthe Contempt Motion stated that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \"should be required to \ncomply immediately with [the Prior Orders] or be held in contempt,\" which is \nexactly the relief the Bankruptcy Court fashioned. \nAppellant cites no Third Circuit authority requiring a two-step process for a \nrule to show cause. (See D.I. 25 at 33-34). Indeed, the Bankruptcy Court routinely \nenters contempt orders in connection with motions for a rule to show cause. See, \ne.g., In re Vaso Active Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 514 B.R. at 418 (entering an order \nfinding defendant in contempt for violating prior court order after plaintiff filed \nmotion for a rule to show cause); see also U.S. S.E. C. v. Hyatt, 621 F .3d 687, 690-\n91 (7th Cir. 2010) {\"In certain limited circumstances, a district court may treat a \nshow-cause motion as a motion for an order on the merits of the alleged contempt \nwhere doing so would not cause prejudice-that is, when it would not violate the \nalleged contemner' s right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.\") ( citing 5 \nWRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE\u00a7 1195 (3d ed. 2004) (\"[A] \n28 request for a show cause order usually will be entertained and treated as a motion, if \ndoing so will not prejudice the opposing parties.\" ( emphasis added)). While some \ncourts have employed a two-step process, it is not always required. (See D.I. 25 at \n33-34 (citing non-binding case from Middle District of Pennsylvania where court \n\"may\" exercise its contempt power after a two-step process). In any event, a two\u00ad\nstep process was unnecessary here. \nAppellant asserts that the first step should have been a hearing on whether \nRubin & Rubin, P.A. complied with the Prior Orders. (D.I. 25 at 34). But it is \nundisputed that it did not. Even counsel for Rubin & Rubin, P.A. has admitted its \nnoncompliance. (See 5/25/21 Tr. at 16:17-22). Thus, the supposed first step in the \ntwo-step process was unnecessary. \nThe second step, according to Appellant, should then have been a contempt \nhearing at which Rubin & Rubin, P.A. could have presented defenses regarding its \ninability to comply with the Prior Orders. (D.I. 25 at 35). But when questioned by \nthe Court, Appellant's counsel could not cite a single defense Rubin & Rubin, P.A. \nintended to raise-including inability to pay-nor explain what issue would require \na second, evidentiary hearing. (See 5/25/21 Tr. at 26:2-10 (counsel to Appellant \nstating that there are various defenses to a rule to show cause, including \"inability to \npay,\" but \"I'm not saying we're going to raise those defenses because I haven't \ndiscussed those with my client ... \"). So the supposed second step in the two-step \nprocess may have proved unnecessary as well. In light of the Bankruptcy Court's \n29 rejection of Appellant's arguments that Lender Appellees lacked standing, that the \nPrior Orders were somehow ambiguous, and that the proposed Contempt Order \nexceeded the scope of the Prior Orders, and, given that Appellant's counsel could \npropose no other defense that required a subsequent evidentiary hearing, the Court \nfinds no abuse of discretion in the entry of the Contempt Order. \nWhile a complete financial inability to comply with an order may be a \ndefense to a charge of civil contempt, Rubin & Rubin, P.A. bears the burden of \nproducing evidence of its inability to comply with the Prior Orders. Egn,otovich v. \nGreenfield Twp. Sewer Auth., 378 F. App'x 121, 123-24 (3d Cir. 2010). Appellant \nsuggested no such evidence in either its written response or at the May 25, 2021 \nhearing. Moreover, the only \"evidence\" offered by Appellant to date ( albeit, \nbelatedly) is a four paragraph, conclusory declaration that it is \"incapable of \ncomplying with [the Contempt Order].\" {TA0130-0131). Even if Appellant had the \nforesight to present this defense in connection with the Contempt Motion, it would \nhave fallen far short of its burden. See Maries L. Offs., LLC v. Mireskandari, 704 F. \nApp'x 171, 178 (3d Cir. 2017) (noting that a \"mere assertion of inability\" does not \nsuffice to support a defense to contempt). Appellant's claims of lack of due process \nring hollow. \nC. The Stay Motion Is Denied As Moot \nOn June 8, 2021, Appellant filed the Stay Motion, arguing that its compliance \nwith the Contempt Order should be stayed pending its appeal on the basis of \n30 irreparable harm: \"Absent a stay pending appeal, Rubin [& Rubin], and all \nindividuals and entities operating under its umbrella, will be faced with a harsh \n$1,000 per diem fine for non-compliance with the Order and, potentially, \nbankruptcy.\" (See D.I. 4 at 7). The Stay Motion was not filed as an emergency \nmotion, did not request expedited consideration, was inadvertently overlooked, and \ncame to the Court's attention again only in the course of deciding this appeal. (See \nid.) Regardless of the merits of that motion, Appellant promptly sought relief \nfollowing entry of the Contempt Order by filing the Stay Motion, and it should not \nbear the consequences of the Court's delay in considering the relief requested. \nAccordingly, while the Contempt Order will be affirmed, and the Stay Motion will \nbe denied as moot, the Court holds that Rubin & Rubin, P.A. will not be responsible \nfor the Contempt Order's $1,000 per day sanction solely with respect to that portion \nof the sanction that otherwise would be attributable to the period between June 8, \n2021-the filing date of the Stay Motion-through the date of entry of the Order \naccompanying this Opinion. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will affirm the Contempt Order in \npart and deny the Stay Motion as moot. The Court will issue an Order consistent \nwith this Opinion. \n31 "}
