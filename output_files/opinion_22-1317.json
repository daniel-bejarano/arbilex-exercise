PARKER,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1317- RGA  \n      : WARDEN ROBERT MAY,  et al.,  :  \n      :   Defendant s.   : \n \n Lance L. Parker, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center , Smyrna, Delaware .   \nPro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n                    \n December  20, 2022  \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Lance L. Parker,  an inmate  at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in \nSmyrna , Delaware,  filed this action pursuant to  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.   (D.I. 3).  He appears \npro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 6 ).  Plaintiff \nrequests counsel.  (D.I. 5).  The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(a).  \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff was injured on April 25, 2022 while playing \nbasketball.  (D .I. 3 at 5).  He asked , and was denied, medical attention by  unnamed \nDepartment of Correction security staff .  (D.I. 3 at 5).  Plaintiff submitted a sick call slip  \nand, using another inmate\u2019s wheelchair, was wheeled to \u201c medical \u201d on April 27, 2022  \n(Id.).  The same day, Plaintiff was taken to the emergency room at Kent General  \nHospital and provided an air boot.  ( Id.)  The hospital was going to provide Plaintiff a \nwheelchair and crutches but DOC staff  indicated that Plaintiff  would be provided the \nitems upon return to JTVCC.  ( Id.).  Kent General physicians told Plaintiff to follow -up \nwith two or three specialists and to take certain pain medication.  ( Id. at 6).  DOC \nsecurity staff took Plaintiff to a physician whom they chose and did not follow the \nphysici an\u2019s recommendations.  ( Id.). \n When Plaintiff  returned to JTVCC , \u201cnothing was provided [except ] generic over -\nthe-counter pain meds & 2 ace bandages.\u201d  ( Id.). He did not begin physical therap y until 2 \n two months after his injury.  (D.I. 7).  Nor did Pla intiff receive crutches until he was \nprovided them on June 29, 2022 during physical therapy.   (Id. at 6).   Plaintiff has \nsubmitted sick call slips and grievances and, as of October 6, 2022, has yet to see a \nneurologist as recommended by multiple physicians .  (Id. at 6, 8 )   In addition, Plaintiff  \nhas not received  the \u201cproper, recommended, or useful pain and nerve medication\u201d , and \nhe does not have proper  braces and support devices.  ( Id. at 6 -7).   Plaintiff spoke twice \nto Defendant Robert May,  JTVCC Warden, about pain and \u201cnot getting the proper \nanything & not seeing the specialists.\u201d  ( Id. at 8). \n Centurion medical staff constantly told DOC and JTVCC staff that Plaintiff \nneeded access to a handicap accessible shower .  (Id. at 7).  Instead, DOC staff moved \nPlaintiff away from the handicap accessible shower , which resulted in Plaintiff slipping in \nthe regular  shower.  ( Id.).  Eventually Captain Willie Burton moved Plaintiff back to the \nhandicap accessible shower .  (Id.). \n On August 22, 2022, Plaintiff submitted sick call slips for mental health care.  \n(Id.).  He saw mental health on August 27, 2022.  ( Id. at 8).   \n Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  \n(Id. at 9). \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or  seeks monetary \nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 3 \n 452 (3d Cir. 2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) .  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 8 9, 93 \n(2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at 94.    \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims  for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant P laintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 4 \n (2007).  A plai ntiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to t he assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016).  Elem ents are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id.  \nDISCUSSION \n Eleventh Amendment Immunity.  The DOC and JTVCC are named \ndefendant s.  The DOC is an agency of the State of Delaware and JTVCC falls under the \numbrella of the DOC.  The Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution \nprotects an unconsenting state or state agency from a suit brought in federal court by one of its own c itizens, regardless of the relief sought.  See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. \nFlorida, 517 U.S. 44, 54  (1996); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. \n89 (1984); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974).  Hence, as an agency of the State 5 \n of Delaware,  the D OC, as well as JTVCC,  are entitled to immunity under the Eleventh \nAmendment.  See, e.g., Evans v. Ford, 2004 WL 2009362, *4 (D. Del. Aug. 25, 2004) . \n The DOC and JTVCC are immune from suit and, therefore, they  will be \ndismissed.     \n Medical Claims.  Plaintiff\u2019s claims rest upon delay or denial of medical care and \nthe type of treatment provided him.   Plaintiff raises claims under the Eighth Amendment \nand negligence under Delaware law.  \n To the extent Plaintiff r aises negligence claim s under state law, in Delaware, \nmedical malpractice is governed by the Delaware Health Care Negligence Insurance \nand Litigation Act.  See 18 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 6801- 6865.  When a party alleges medical \nnegligence, Delaware law requires the par ty to produce an affidavit of merit with expert \nmedical testimony detailing: (1) the applicable standard of care, (2) the alleged deviation from that standard, and (3) the causal link between the deviation and the alleged injury.   Bonesmo v. Nemours Foundation , 253 F. Supp. 2d 801, 804 (D. Del. 2003) (quoting \nGreen v. Weiner , 766 A.2d 492, 494- 95 (Del. 2001)) ( cleaned up); 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853.  \nBecause Plaintiff alleges medical negligence, at the time he filed the Complaint he was required to submit an affidavit of merit as to each defendant signed by an expert \nwitness.  See  18 Del. C. \u00a76853(a)(1).  Plaintiff failed to accompany the C omplaint with \nan affidavit of merit as required by 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(1).  Accordingly, all medical \nnegligence claims  will be  dismissed.  \n As to the medical claims under the Eight h Amendment, a  prison official \u2019s \n\u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\u201d is a kind of cruel and 6 \n unusual punishment \u201cproscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 \nU.S. 97, 104 (1976).  See also Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) (when a prison \ndeprives a prisoner of adequate medical care, courts have a responsibility to remedy \nthe resulting Eighth Amendment violation); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 \n(1994) (under the Eighth Amendment , prisons officials must ensure inmates receive \nadequate medical care).  \nIn order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege (i) a serious \nmedical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate \nindifference to that need.  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier , 182 \nF.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999).  A prison official is deliberately indifferent if the official  \nknows that a prisoner faces a substantial risk of serious harm and fails to take \nreasonable steps to avoid the harm.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 837.  A \u201cprison \nofficial may manifest deliberate indifference by intentionally denying or delaying access \nto medical care.\u201d  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. at 104- 05.  A \u201c failure to provide adequate \ncare . . . [that] was deliberate, and motivated by non- medical  factors \u201d is actionable \nunder the Eighth Amendment, but \u201d inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in \nmedical judgment \u201d is not.  Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll , 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993).   \n In addition, a prisoner does not have the right to choose a specifi c form of \nmedical treatment .  Lasko v. Watts , 373 F. App\u2019 x 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) ( citing  \nHarrison v. Barkley , 219 F.3d 132, 138- 140 (2d Cir. 2000)).  An inmate\u2019 s claims against \nmembers of a prison medical department are not viable under \u00a7 1983 where the inmate \nreceives continuing care, but believes that more should be done by way of diagnosis 7 \n and treatment and maintains that options available to medical personnel  were not \npursued on the inmate \u2019s behalf.  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. at 107.  In addition, \nallegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a constitutional \nviolation.  See White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108- 09 (3d Cir. 1990); see als o \nDaniels v. Williams , 474 U.S. 327, 332- 34 (1986) .    \n When a plaintiff relies upon a theory of respondeat superior to hold a corporation \nsuch as Defendant Centurion liable, the plaintiff  must allege a policy or custom that \ndemonstrates such deliberate indifference.  Sample v. Diecks , 885 F.2d 1099, 1110 (3d \nCir. 1989); Miller v. Correctional Med. Sys., Inc ., 802 F. Supp. 1126, 1132 (D. Del. \n1992).   In order to establish that C enturion is directly liable for the alleged constitutional \nviolations, Plaintiff  \u201cmust provide evidence that there was a relevant [C enturion] policy \nor custom, and that the policy caused the constitutional violations plaintiff alleges]. \u201d  \nNatale v. Camden County Corr. Facility , 318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003) .   \n As pled, the allegat ions fail to state cognizable medical needs claims  under the \nEighth Amendment .  Plaintiff has received medical care.  He alleges that he was injured \nand two days later he was taken to the prison infirmary and then the hospital for \ntreatment .  He was seen for follow -up by a physician as recommended, but not a \nphysician to his liking.   He receives pain medication, albeit not that recommended by \nthe hospital.  He received physical therapy and crutches.  And he has received mental \nhealth care  \n Plaintiff  complained to Warden May about his care.  The Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit has concluded, however, that prison administrators cannot be deliberately 8 \n indifferent \u201csimply because they failed to respond directly to the medical complaints of a \nprisoner  who was already being treated by the prison doctor. \u201d  Durmer v. O \u2019Carroll, 991 \nF.2d at 69.  \u201cIf a prisoner is under the care of medical experts . . . a non- medical prison \nofficial will generally be justified in believing that the prisoner is in capable ha nds\u201d  \nSpruill v. Gillis , 372 F.3d 218, 236 (3d Cir. 2004) (discussing Durmer, 991 F.2d at 69).  \n\u201c[A]bsent a reason to believe (or actual knowledge) that prison doctors or their \nassistants are mistreating (or not treating) a prisoner, a non- medical prison official . . . \nwill not be chargeable with the Eighth Amendment scienter requirement of deliberate \nindifference. \u201d  Id. at 236.   Hence, the claim against Warden May fails.  \n Plain tiff has not alleged there was a relevant C enturion policy or custom, and that \nthe policy caused the constitutional violation s plaintiff  claims.   Therefore, the claim \nagainst Centurion fails.   Plaintiff alleges that DOC staff, JTVCC staff, and Centurion \nstaff violated his rights but does not name the individuals responsible for the \nwrongdoing.  With more facts, perhaps he could state claim s against them.  Finally, \nPlaintiff alleges that to date he has not been seen by a neurologist.  This could possibly \nstate a claim if alleged with more supporting facts.  \n The \u00a7 1983 claims will be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which relief  \ncan be granted and for naming defendants who are immune from suit .  Because it is \npossible that Plaintiff may be able to state cognizable claims  against defendants who \nare not immune from suit , he will be given leave to amend.  \n  Request for Counsel .  Plaintiff requests counsel.  (D.I.  5).  Plaintiff  states that \ncounsel  is necessary since  certain evidence cannot be obtained because he is 9 \n incarcerated, he is taking mental health medications,  he is deemed seriously mentally \nill, he has \u201c so many mental health illnesses that [ he does ] not understand & cannot \ngrasp the talk or language of civil law ,\u201d and he does not \u201c have the knowledge or \nresources of counsel. \u201d  (D.I. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7 ).  Plaintiff also seeks counsel on the grounds \nthat he is limited in his ability to present the case considering his education, literacy, \nexperience, and incarceration, the legal issues are complex, he does not have the \nability to pursue an investigation, h e does not have the ability to retain counsel on his \nown behalf, and t he case will  require credibility determinations and/or expert testimony .  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2 -6).   \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2) provides , \u201cThe court must appoint a \nguardian ad li tem - or issue another appropriate order -  to protect a minor or \nincompetent person who is unrepresented in an action. \u201d  The United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit has determined that the district court has a responsibility to \ninquire sua sponte under Rule 17(c)(2) whether a pro se litigant is incompetent to \nlitigate his action and is, therefore, entitled to either appointment of a guardian ad litem \nor other measures to protect his rights.  See Powell v. Symons , 680 F.3d 301, 307 (3d \nCir. 2012).   \nThe Court considers whether Rule 17(c) applies \u201c [i]f a court [is] presented with \nevidence from an appropriate court of record or a relevant public agency indicating that the party had been adjudicated incompetent, or if the court receive[s] verifiable evidence \nfrom a mental health professional demonstrating that the party is being or has been \ntreated for mental illness of the type that would render him or her legally incompetent. \u201d  10 \n Powell, 680 F.3d at 307.  The court \u201c need not inquire sua sponte into a pro se plaintiff \u2019s \nmental competence based on a litigant \u2019s bizarre behavior alone, even if such behavior \nmay suggest mental incapacity. \u201d  Id.  The decision whether to appoint a guardian ad \nlitem rests with the sound discretion of the district court.   Id.  \nIn the instant action,  Plaintiff  makes bald allegations of mental illness .  He  has \nnot submitted any verifiable evidence of incompetence to this C ourt.  Thus, this Court \nhas no duty to conduct a sua sponte determination of competency under Rule 17(c)(2).   \nNevertheless, in the interests of justice, the Court wil l reconsider should Plaintiff submit \nevidence sufficient to show that he lacks mental competence.   \nA pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis  has no constitutional or statutory \nright to representation by counsel. 0F1  See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 192 (3d \nCir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147, 153 (3d Cir. 1993).  However, representation \nby counsel may be appropriate under certain circums tances, after a finding that a \nplaintiff =s claim has arguable merit in fact and law.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155.   After passing \nthis threshold inquiry, the court should consider a number of factors when assessing a \nrequest for counsel.  Factors to be considered by a court in deciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the merits of the plaintiff \u2019s claim; \n(2) the plaintiff \u2019s ability to present his or her case considering his or her education, \nliteracy, experience, and the restraints placed upon him or her by incarceration; (3) the \n \n1See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa , 490 U.S. 296 \n(1989) ( \u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7  1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an \nunwilling attorney to represent an indigent civ il litigant, the operative word in the statute \nbeing \u201crequest. \u201d). 11 \n complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to which factual investigation is required \nand the plaintiff \u2019s ability to pursue such investigation; (5) the plaintiff \u2019s capacity to retain \ncounsel on his or her own behalf; and (6) the degree to which the case turns on \ncredibility determinations or expert testimony.  See Montgomery v. Pinchak , 294 F.3d \n492, 498- 99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155- 56.  The list is not exhaustive, nor is \nany one f actor determinative.  Tabron, 6 F.3d at 157.   \n After reviewing Plaintiff\u2019s  request, the C ourt concludes that the case is not so \nfactually or legally complex that requesting an attorney is warranted.  To date, the filings \nin this case demonstrate Plaintiff\u2019s  ability to articulate his claims and represent himself.  \nMoreover, at this time there i s not an operative complaint, all claims having been \ndismissed.  Thus, in these circumstances, the Court will deny without prejudice to renew Plaintiff \u2019s request for counsel.   \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will : (1) deny  without prejudice to renew  \nPlaintiff\u2019s  request for counsel; ( 2) dismiss  the Delaware Department of Correction and \nJames T. Vaughn Correctional Center as  immune from suit; and (3) dismiss the \nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C . \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) & (iii) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1)  \n& (2).   \nPlaintiff will be given leave to amend.  \n An appropriate O rder will be entered.
