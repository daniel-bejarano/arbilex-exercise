December 13, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware OPINION \n11 This patent infringement case arises out of separate filings of Abbreviated \nNew Drug Applications (ANDAs) by Defendant Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. \nand by Defendants Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex) with the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to market generic versions \nof Plaintiff Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.' s Hetlioz\u00ae drug product. \nHetlioz\u00ae is the only FDA-approved drug indicated for the treatment ofNon-\n24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a circadian rhythm sleep disorder suffered by \nindividuals whose biological clocks do not synchronize to a 24-hour day. Vanda \nsells Hetlioz\u00ae in 20 milligram tasimelteon capsules. \nVanda has asserted four patents. It alleges that, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 271(e)(2)(A), Defendants' ANDA submissions to the FDA constitute \ninfringement of claim 3 of U.S. Patent No. RE46,604 (the RE604 patent), claim 14 \nof U.S. Patent No 10,149,829 (the #829 patent), claim 4 of U.S. Patent No. \n9,730,910 (the #910 patent), and claim 5 of U.S. Patent No. 10,376,487 (the #487 \npatent). \nDefendants have stipulated to infringement of claim 5 of the #487 patent. \nThey otherwise deny infringement and assert in their defense that the asserted \npatent claims are invalid. I held a four-day bench trial, and, as required by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 52(a)(l), I have set forth separately below my findings of fact and \nconclusions of law. \nI. THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nThe ANDA procedures out of which this case arises were established by \nFDA regulations promulgated pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq., and specifically by the so-called Hatch\u00ad\nWaxman Amendments to the FDCA. Justice Kagan provided in Caraco \nPharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo NordiskAIS, 566 U.S. 399 (2012), this \nhelpful summary of the provisions of the Amendments and the FDA regulations \nthat bear on this case: \nThe FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and \nlabeling of prescription drugs under a complex statutory \nscheme. To begin at the beginning: When a brand \nmanufacturer wishes to market a novel drug, it must \nsubmit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for \napproval. The NDA must include, among other things, a \nstatement of the drug's components, scientific data \nshowing that the drug is safe and effective, and proposed \nlabeling describing the uses for which the drug may be \nmarketed. The FDA may approve a brand-name drug for \nmultiple methods of use-either to treat different \nconditions or to treat the same condition in different \nways. \nOnce the FDA has approved a brand \nmanufacturer's drug, another company may seek \npermission to market a generic version pursuant to \nlegislation known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. \n2 Those amendments allow a generic competitor to file an \nabbreviated new drug application (ANDA) piggy\u00ad\nbacking on the brand's NDA. Rather than providing \nindependent evidence of safety and efficacy, the typical \nANDA shows that the generic drug has the same active \ningredients as, and is biologically equivalent to, the \nbrand-name drug. As we have previously recognized, \nthis process is designed to speed the introduction of low\u00ad\ncost generic drugs to market. \nBecause the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug \nthat would infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA's \napproval depends on the scope and duration of the \npatents covering the brand-name drug. Those patents \ncome in different varieties. One type protects the drug \ncompound itself. Another kind ... gives the brand \nmanufacturer exclusive rights over a particular method of \nusing the drug. In some circumstances, a brand \nmanufacturer may hold such a method-of-use patent even \nafter its patent on the drug compound has expired. \nTo facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon \nas patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and \nFDA regulations direct brand manufacturers to file \ninformation about their patents. The statute mandates \nthat a brand submit in its NDA the patent number and the \nexpiration date of any patent which claims the drug for \nwhich the brand submitted the NDA or which claims a \nmethod of using such drug. And the regulations issued \nunder that statute require that, once an ND A is approved, \nthe brand provide a description of any method-of-use \npatent it holds. That description is known as a use code, \nand the brand submits it on FDA Form 3542 .... [T]he \nFDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the use \ncodes that brand manufacturers supply. It simply \npublishes the codes, along with the corresponding patent \nnumbers and expiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued \nvolume called the Orange Book (less colorfully but more \nofficially denominated Approved Drug Products With \nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations). \n3 After consulting the Orange Book, a company \nfiling an ANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed \ngeneric drug will not infringe the brand's patents. When \nno patents are listed in the Orange Book or all listed \npatents have expired ( or will expire prior to the AND A's \napproval), the generic manufacturer simply certifies to \nthat effect. Otherwise, the applicant has two possible \nways to obtain approval. \n* * * * \n[One of those ways] is to file a so-called paragraph \nIV certification, which states that a listed patent \"is \ninvalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, \nor sale of the generic drug.\" 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A generic manufacturer will \ntypically take this path in either of two situations: if it \nwants to market the drug for all uses, rather than carving \nout those still allegedly under patent; or if it discovers, as \ndescribed above, that any carve-out label it is willing to \nadopt cannot avoid the brand's use code. Filing a \nparagraph IV certification means provoking litigation. \nThe patent statute treats such a filing as itself an act of \ninfringement, which gives the brand an immediate right \nto sue [under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27l(e)(2)(A)]. Assuming the \nbrand does so, the FDA generally may not approve the \nANDA until 30 months pass or the court finds the patent \ninvalid or not infringed. Accordingly, the paragraph IV \nprocess is likely to keep the generic drug off the market \nfor a lengthy period, but may eventually enable the \ngeneric company to market its drug for all approved uses. \n566 U.S. at 404-08 (irrelevant citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n4 II.

DTX \n397 at 1-2. I found at trial and confirm here that Dr. Emens was very credible. As \nI stated at the conclusion of the trial: \n[H]is mannerism while testifying, his directness and lack \nof hesitation. He does not appear to have any source of \nbias. And so, I found his testimony to be compelling. \nAnd ... that's a factual finding that I'm making. And \nI'm making it today because I have had many days \nwatching these witnesses, all of whom are very, very \nimpressive, but his testimony in particular stuck out to \nme. \nTr. at 1258:2-10. \n18) Dr. David Greenblatt is a Professor in the Department of Immunology \nat the Tufts University School ofMedicine. DTX 398 at 1. \nC. Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) \n19) Circadian rhythms are internal physiological and behavioral patterns \nthat are regulated by an endogenous pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic \n8 nuclei (SCN) of the human brain. Tr. at 705:23-706:9 (Emens); PTX 815 at 17; \nPTX 002 at 1-2. \n20) In most people, including most blind people, the period generated by \nthe SCN is slightly longer than 24 hours. Tr. at 1182:25-1183:8 (Czeisler); JTX \n145 at 2. \n21) Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (Non-24), also called free-running \ndisorder, is a circadian rhythm disorder occurring in individuals whose 24-hour \nbiological clock is no longer synchronized (i.e., entrained) to the 24-hour day. \nPTX 005; Tr. at 115:17-116:5 (Polymeropoulos); PTX 002 at 1; PTX 815 at 17; \nJTX 084 at 3. \n22) Doctors and other experts who study sleep disorders, refer to this lack \nof synchronization as a lack of entrainment, and they use \"entrainment\" and \n\"synchronization\" (and \"entrain\" and \"synchronize\") interchangeably when \ndiscussing Non-24. See, e.g., PTX 005 at 1. \n23) Approximately 55 to 70 percent of totally blind individuals (i.e., \nthose lacking conscious light perception) suffer from Non-24. \n24) The symptoms ofNon-24 are sleep disturbance-i.e., decreased and \npoor nighttime sleep and increased daytime sleep-and lack of daytime alertness. \nPTX 005 at 1; Tr. at 496:18-25, 528:20-529:7 (Winkelman); Tr. at 214:12-215:11 \n(Combs). \n9 25) Sleep disturbance is the main reason why patients suffering from Non-\n24 seek treatment from a doctor. Tr. at 496:18-25 (Winkelman); see also PTX 815 \nat 17 (tasimelteon clinical report noting that \"[p Joor quality or quantity of sleep \nand excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from Non-24 are common complaints\" \nof patients). \n26) Lack of entrainment is the only known cause ofNon-24. Tr. at \n212:4-10 (Combs); Tr. at 524:15-17 (Winkelman); PTX 005. \nD. The Goals of Non-24 Treatment \n27) When treating a patient, doctors can choose to address the patient's \nsymptoms, the cause of the patient's illness, or both the symptoms and the cause. \nTr. at 496:14-498:5 (Winkelman). As Dr. Winkelman credibly testified: \n[Y]ou can treat the underlying cause or you can treat the \nsymptoms. In medicine, we understand this distinction \nwith patients every day .... \" \nTr. at 496: 14-17 (Winkelman). \n28) Entrainment can be a goal ofNon-24 treatment. Tr. at 116:6-117:1 \n(Polymeropoulos); Tr. at 212:4-10 (Combs); Tr. at 529:15-20 (Winkelman); PTX \n815 at 17. \n29) Limiting sleep disturbances so as to increase nighttime sleep and \ndecrease daytime sleep can also be a goal ofNon-24 treatment. Tr. at 496: 18-25, \n498:9-16, 499:8-10 (Winkelman); JTX 084 at 3, 9. \n10 30) Vanda argues, but it did not establish by a preponderance of the \nevidence, that \"[t]he goal in treating individuals with Non-24 is to synchronize \ntheir circadian clock with the external light-dark cycle.\" D.I. 312 ~ 38 (emphasis \nadded). Vanda cites in support of this argument the testimony of three witnesses \n(Drs. Combs, Winkelman, and Polymeropoulos) and a sentence from a clinical \nstudy report for tasimelteon (PTX 815). But that record evidence does not \nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that entrainment is necessarily the \nonly goal ofNon-24 treatment. \n31) Dr. Combs, for example, testified only that entrainment can be a goal \nin treating individuals with Non-24, see Tr. at 212:9-10 (Combs) (\"to treat Non-\n24, a goal would be to entraining the patient\"), and when pressed on cross\u00ad\nexamination he acknowledged that tasimelteon can also be used to increase \nnighttime sleep and reduce daytime sleep: \nQ .... [D]o you agree that in addition to entraining a \nNon-24 patient, that tasimelteon can also increase total \nsleep time per day and reduce total naptime per day? \nA. When patients are most symptomatic, I absolutely \nagree. \nTr. at 242:10-15 (Combs). \n32) Dr. Winkelman similarly testified that entrainment can be a goal of \nNon-24 treatment but that treating sleep disturbances is also a goal. See Tr. at \n496:18-25, 498:9-16, 499:8-10 (Winkelman). \n11 33) Dr. Polymeropoulos testified that \"we knew that a goal, the goal, of a \nsuccessful treatment Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder that would be accepted by \nexperts would have been the demonstration of entrainment of the 24-hour circadian \nrhythm.\" Tr. at 212:4-10 (Polymeropoulos). I find it telling that he first stated, \"a \ngoal,\" before he corrected himself and said, \"the goal.\" And I also discount Dr. \nPolymeropoulos's testimony because of what I observed to be a self-serving \ndemeanor on the stand and because he is a named inventor with a financial interest \nin the outcome of this litigation. \n34) The sentence in the clinical study Vanda relies on reads: \"The \nultimate goal in treating individuals with Non-24 is to synchronize their circadian \nclock with the 24-hour day so that all of their physiology and behavior is aligned \nappropriately with the 24-hour social day.\" PTX 815 at 17. But as Dr. Winkelman \ncredibly testified, the ultimate goal in a treatment is not necessarily or always the \ngoal of the treatment regimen. Indeed, the word \"ultimate\" makes clear that there \nare other goals, as \"ultimate\" is a relative term that describes \"the best or most \nextreme of its kind.\" See Ultimate, MERRIAM-WEBSTER.COM, \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ultimate (last visited Dec. 12, 2022). \n35) Finally, the cited clinical study itself undermines Vanda's argument \nthat the sole goal ofNon-24 treatment is entrainment. The study identifies \n\"secondary objectives\" ofNon-24 treatment that include increased nighttime sleep \n12 in the lower quartile of nights (LQ-nTST) and decreased daytime sleep in the upper \nquartile of days (UQ-dTSD). PTX 815 at 9; Tr. at 508:3-13, 508:19-509:3 \n(Winkelman). \nE. Defendants' ANDAs and Drug Labels \n36) Tasimelteon is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Vanda's \nHetlioz\u00ae drug product and in each of Defendants' ANDA products. D.I. 287, Ex. \n1 ,-[ 106. \n37) Teva filed ANDA No. 211601 with the FDA seeking approval for the \ncommercial manufacture, use, and sale of tasimelteon prior to the expiration of the \nasserted patents. D.I. 287 at 44-45. \n38) Teva's ANDA contains a certification pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355G)(2)(a)(vii)(IV) alleging that each of the asserted claims is invalid and will \nnot be infringed by Teva's ANDA Product. D.I. 287 at 44. \n39) Teva delivered letters to Vanda notifying Vanda ofTeva's Paragraph \nIV certifications. D.I. 287 at 44-46. \n40) Apotex filed ANDA No. 211607 with the FDA seeking approval for \nthe commercial manufacture, use, and sale of tasimelteon prior to the expiration of \nthe asserted patents. D.I. 287 at 46-47. \n41) Apotex's ANDA contains a Paragraph IV Certification alleging that \neach of the asserted claims is invalid, and that, except for claim 5 of the #487 \n13 patent, Apotex's ANDA Product will not infringe the asserted patents. D.I. 287 at \n47. \n42) Apotex delivered letters to Vanda notifying Vanda of Apotex's \nParagraph IV certifications. D.I. 287 at 46-49. \n43) A drug label contains instructions for prescribers about how to use a \nmedication. Tr. at 211:18-21 (Combs). The intended audience for a drug label is \nwhoever is prescribing the medication, which in the case of tasimelteon would be \nprimarily sleep medicine physicians. Tr. at 211 :22-24 (Combs). \n44) The language in Defendants' proposed labeling for each of their \nrespective proposed ANDA products is essentially the same in all relevant respects \nto Vanda's FDA-approved Hetlioz\u00ae drug labeling. D.I. 287, Ex. 1197. \n45) Defendants' proposed labels for tasimelteon are, in all relevant ways, \nthe same as the parts of Vanda's Hetlioz\u00ae label directed to the treatment ofNon-\n24, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions. D.I. 287, Ex. 1 197. \n46) Each of Defendants' ANDA products contains 20 milligrams of \ntasimelteon. D.I. 287, Ex. 1 199. \n47) Each of Defendants' labels recommends that 20 milligrams of \ntasimelteon be administered one hour before bedtime, at the same time every night. \nD.I. 287, Ex. 11100; JTX 030 at 2; JTX 033 at 3. \n14 48) The intended audience for Teva's proposed label is prescribers such as \nphysicians. Tr. at 304:7-16 (DeCicco). Teva expects prescribers of its generic \ntasimelteon product to \"follow what's in the labeling.\" Tr. at 304:17-21 \n(DeCicco). \n49) The intended audience for Apotex's proposed label is prescribers. Tr. \nat 307:11-14 (Singh). The purpose of Apotex's proposed label \"is to guide the \nphysicians and to know more about the product and the molecule.\" Tr. at 307: 11-\n14 (Singh). Apotex expects prescribers to follow the information in Apotex's label \nwhen prescribing tasimelteon and understands that \"the dosage regime is as per the \nlabeling that is approved for the brand and that is what we have to follow.\" Tr. at \n307:15-19, 308:1-8 (Singh). \n50) Defendants' labels for each of their proposed drugs state that they are \n\"indicated for the treatment ofNon-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) in \nadults.\" JTX 030 at 2; JTX 033 at 3. \n51) Defendants' labels do not use the words \"entrain,\" \"entrainment,\" \n\"synchronize,\" \"synchronization,\" or \"synchronizing.\" \n52) I find credible Dr. Winkelman's testimony that defendants' labels \"do \nnot encourage, recommend, require or promote the use of defendants' products as a \nmethod specifically here for entraining a patient.\" Tr. at 495 :21-24 (Winkelman). \n15 53) Vanda argues that section 1 of Defendants' labels promotes and \nencourages treating Non-24 by entraining because that section \"states that \ntasimelteon is indicated for the treatment ofNon-24.\" D.I. 311 at 21. But as noted \nabove, although entrainment can be a goal-and indeed the ultimate goal-ofNon-\n24 treatment, it is not necessarily the only goal of such treatment. \n54) Vanda also argues that sections 2.2 and 2.4 encourage and promote \nthe treatment ofNon-24 by entrainment. D.I. 311 at 22. Section 2.2 instructs \nprescribers to administer 20mg of tasimelteon one hour before bedtime at the same \ntime every night. JTX 030 at 2; JTX 033 at 3. Section 2.4 instructs that a patient \nwho cannot take tasimelteon at the same time on a given night should skip that \nday's dose rather than take it too early or too late. JTX 030 at 2; JTX 033 at 3. A \nprescriber, however, would understand that tasimelteon induces sleepiness and for \nthat reason might want the patient to take tasimelteon near bedtime every night for \nits soporific effect and not for entrainment. Tr. at 1210:24-1211:6 (Czeisler). \nThus, I find that sections 2.2 and 2.4 do not necessarily imply that a prescriber \nshould use tasimelteon to entrain the patient. \n55) Vanda also argues that section 14.1 and Table 3 ofDefendants' labels \nteach and promote the use oftasimelteon to treat Non-24 through entrainment \nbecause they \"describe[] the results seen in patients in Vanda's SET and RESET \nclinical trials.\" D.I. 311 at 23. The description of those results, however, makes \n16 no mention of entrainment endpoints; instead it reports two sleep-measure \n\"efficacy endpoints\" for \"duration and timing of nighttime sleep and daytime naps \n... based on [1] the 25% of nights with the least nighttime sleep, and [2] the 25% \nof days with the most daytime nap time.\" JTX 030 at 8-9; JTX 033 at 10-11; Tr. \nat 500:11-501: 1 (Winkelman). These endpoints measure the drug's effect on \nsymptoms of Non-24-i.e., insufficient nighttime sleep and increased daytime \nsleep. Tr. at499:3-22, 500:11-501:1, 501:9-14, 503:3-504:25 (Winkelman). \n56) I found credible Dr. Winkelman's testimony that if the intent of \nDefendants' labels were to induce the treatment ofNon-24 by entrainment, one \nwould expect the clinical studies reported in Defendants' labels to include \nentrainment endpoints such as biomarkers for \"melatonin ... or cortisol or some \nhormone that could represent entrainment.\" Tr. at 501:18-22 (Winkelman). \n57) Accordingly, I find that Vanda failed to prove by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that Defendants' ANDA labels instruct, recommend, encourage, \nteach, or promote the use of Defendants' tasimelteon drug products to treat Non-24 \nby entraining a patient to a 24-hours sleep-wake cycle. \n17 F. The Asserted Patents \n1.

The Artisan of Ordinary Skill \n70) Initially, the parties offered competing but similar definitions of the \nartisan of ordinary skill to whom the asserted patents are directed. Defendants' \nartisan called for a higher level of education and more experience in conducting \nclinical trials than Vanda's artisan. Compare D.I. 287 at 601-02 (Vanda's \ndefinition) with D.I. 287 at 612 (Defendants' definition). \n71) Before trial, however, the parties stipulated that \"[e]ach Party's expert \nis qualified as an expert in the relevant field\" and that \"[:t]or the purposes of the \ninfringement and invalidity analysis\" of the patents asserted at trial \"each expert's \nopinion would be the same using either definition of a person of ordinary skill in \nthe art.\" D.I. 298 ,-r,-r 1, 4. Accordingly, I make no finding of fact with respect to \nthe artisan of ordinary skill. \nH. Knowledge of an Artisan of Ordinary Skill as of January 26, 2012 \n1. Exogenous Melatonin Could Effectively Entrain Blind \nPeople with Non-24 \n72) As early as 2000, it was well known among artisans of ordinary skill \nthat exogenous melatonin was a drug that could entrain blind patients with Non-24 \nto a normal 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. Tr. at 709:18-22 (Emens). \n21 73) Skilled artisans, moreover, knew the mechanism by which exogenous \nmelatonin achieved entrainment. Tr. at 709:23-25 (Emens). \n7 4) Exogenous melatonin is a melatonin agonist that binds to the \nmelatonin 1 and melatonin 2 receptors, often referred to as the MTl and MT2 \nreceptors. Tr. at 710:1-3 (Emens). \n75) Skilled artisans knew that exogenous melatonin's binding affinities \nfor these receptors were what gave the drug its ability to reset or \"phase shift\" a \nperson's circadian rhythm and thereby entrain them to a normal 24-hour cycle. Tr. \nat 710:1-3 (Emens). \n76) By 2007, the use of melatonin to treat Non-24 was formally \nrecommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. DTX 03 7 at 11; see \nTr. at 722:20-723:22 (Emens). \n77) Prior art described the \"[d]aily administration of exogenous melatonin \n[a]s the current treatment of choice for this so-called 'non-24 h sleep/wake \ndisorder.\"' DTX 039 at 1. \n2. Tasimelteon is a Melatonin Agonist with Similar Properties \nto Exogenous Melatonin \n78) As of January 26, 2012, skilled artisans knew that tasimelteon is a \nmelatonin agonist with similar properties to exogenous melatonin. \n79) Early animal studies oftasimelteon concluded that tasimelteon was \"a \nnovel melatonin receptor agonist that may be a useful treatment for sleep disorders \n22 that result from disruption of circadian rhythms\" in humans. JTX 091 at 1; Tr. at \n725:5-726:11 (Emens). \n80) By 2007, Vanda filed an international patent application (the #244 \nPublication) directed to administering tasimelteon to treat circadian rhythm \ndisorders and sleep disorders. DTX 041. \n81) The #244 Publication describes tasimelteon as a \"specific and potent \nagonist of the MTl[] and MT2[] melatonin receptors\" in the human brain and as a \ncompound that \"demonstrates potent chronobiotic activity\" in the human body. \nDTX 041 at 2; see Tr. at 727:15-19 (Emens). \n82) Other prior-art references concluded that (1) tasimelteon was like \nexogenous melatonin in that both had similar binding affinities for the MTl and \nMT2 receptors and could phase-shift a person's circadian rhythm and (2) \ntasimelteon could therefore potentially entrain patients suffering from circadian \nrhythm sleep disorders. See DTX O 16 at 1 (\"Tasimelteon ... is a melatonin \nreceptor agonist. Because of the high density of melatonin receptors in the \ncircadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonergic actions can phase\u00ad\nshift circadian rhythms and promote sleep.\"); DTX 020 at 6 (\"[T]asimelteon has \nhigh affinity for both the MTl and MT2 receptors, both in ranges similar to that of \nmelatonin. Therefore, tasimelteon should be especially well suited for treatment of \n23 CRSDs [ circadian rhythm sleep disorders]. . . . Tasimelteon has already \ndemonstrated its circadian phase-resetting effects.\"). \n83) Vanda's CEO wrote in a 2009 article that \"a phase-shifting drug, such \nas tasimelteon, has therapeutic potential for circadian rhythm sleep disorders.\" Tr. \nat 175:7-10 (Polymeropoulos). \n3. 20 mg Dosage of Tasimelteon \n84) A skilled artisan would have known in January 2012 that Vanda \nsought international patent protection in 2007 for orally administering 20 \nmilligrams oftasimelteon, once a day, 0.5 to 1.5 hours before bedtime. DTX 041 \nat 25-26; Tr. at 726:12-728:6 (Emens). \n85) As of 2010, a person of ordinary skill in the art would also have \nknown from the prior art that Vanda had initiated a phase III clinical trial for \ntasimelteon in which totally blind subjects with Non-24 were being administered \nthe drug in 20 milligram doses. DTX 020 at 6; Tr. at 797:3-12, 799:8-15 (Emens). \n4. Potential Drug-Drug Interactions \n86) Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play an important role in a \nperson's metabolism of drugs. Tr. at 1041 :1-25 (Greenblatt). A skilled artisan \nwould have known as of January 2012 that six to eight CYP enzymes are \nresponsible for the metabolism of nearly 90 percent of all drugs. Tr. at 1031: 18-25 \n24 (Greenblatt); Tr. at 1147:7-13, 1147:25-1148:5 (Parkinson); see also JTX 095 at \n1; DTX 009 at 2. \n87) \"Drug-drug interaction\" refers to the situation where two drugs are \ngiven together and one of them alters the metabolism of the other.\" Tr. at 1041:4-\n5 (Greenblatt). \n88) A skilled artisan would have been aware in January 2012 of the \nFDA's requirements for in vitro testing of all new drugs to identify enzymes, \nincluding CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, that contribute to a drug's metabolism. Tr. at \n1032:23-1033:3, 1033:14-22 (Greenblatt); Tr. at 1148:6-11 (Parkinson). \n89) Drugs that reduce another drug's metabolism and increase that drug's \nplasma concentrations are known as \"CYP inhibitors.\" Tr. at 1041 :3-15 \n(Greenblatt). \n90) It was common knowledge as of January 2012 that fluvoxamine was \nan inhibitor, if not the strongest inhibitor, of CYP1A2. Tr. at 1043:3-9 \n(Greenblatt); Tr. at 1149:3-7 (Parkinson). \n91) Drugs that induce the expression of CYP enzymes and cause \nincreased metabolism and decreased plasma concentrations of another drug are \ncalled \"CYP inducers.\" Tr. at 1041 :3-22, 1042:9-23 (Greenblatt); see also DTX \n024 at 3; DTX 009 at 4-5; JTX 095 at 3. \n25 92) It was common knowledge as of January 2012 that rifampicin (i.e., \nrifampin) was the strongest inducer ofCYP3A4. Tr. at 1043:10-17 (Greenblatt); \nTr. at 1148: 18-22 (Parkinson). Rifampin and rifampicin are synonyms. See Tr. at \n39:25-40:1; Tr. at 158:6-10 (Polymeropoulos). \n93) A skilled artisan would have been aware in January 2012 that one can \npredict possible drug-drug interactions for any new drug, even before the drug \nreaches the clinical phase of development. Tr. at 1149:8-1150:14 (Parkinson); see \nalso DTX 009 at 7. \nI \n94) A skilled artisan would have been aware in January 2012 of the prior \nFDA approval of ramelteon and that tasimelteon and ramelteon bind to the same \nmelatonin receptors (MTl and MT2) and have similar half lives in the body. Tr. at \n1035:7-18, 1037:5-18, 1040:6-19 (Greenblatt); see also DTX 016 at 3; JTX 035 \nat 1, 3. \n95) Further, a skilled artisan would have looked to ramelteon as relevant \nto understanding possible drug-drug interactions for tasimelteon because ramelteon \nand tasimelteon are structurally similar, as both drugs have a dihydrobenzofuran \nstructure and a propanamide residue. Tr. at 1040:6-22 (Greenblatt); DTX 016 at \n4-5. \n26 96) A skilled artisan would have known that ramelteon is metabolized by \nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Tr. at 1038:25-1039:13, 1040:6-24 (Greenblatt); Tr. at \n1156:6-10 (Parkinson); see also JTX 093 at 4; JTX 035 at 2, 10. \n97) A skilled artisan also would have known that ramelteon' s in vivo \nmetabolism resulted in large drug-drug interactions with fluvoxamine (CYP1A2 \ninhibitor) and rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer). \n98) A skilled artisan would have known in January 2012 that ramelteon \nunderwent a 100-fold increase in blood plasma levels when it was co-administered \nwith the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine. Tr. at 1043:18-1045:12, 1116:24-\n1117:13 (Greenblatt); see also DTX 028 at 9; JTX 093 at 4. A skilled artisan \nwould have known that any drug-drug interaction resulting in a five-fold change in \nblood plasma levels is considered \"large\" by FDA standards, and therefore a \nskilled artisan would have viewed the ramelteon-fluvoxamine drug-drug \ninteraction as a \"huge interaction\" and clearly significant. Tr. at 1045: 15-23 \n(Greenblatt). \n99) A skilled artisan also would have known in January 2012 that \nramelteon undergoes an 80 percent decrease in blood plasma levels when it is co\u00ad\nadministered with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampin. Tr. at 1046:5-21 (Greenblatt); \nsee also JTX 035 at 10. \n27 100) Further, a skilled artisan would have been aware in January 2012 that \nthese well-known drug-drug interactions for ramelteon are reflected in its FDA\u00ad\napproved label, which discloses that ramelteon and fluvoxamine should not be co\u00ad\nadministered. Tr. at 1045:24-1046:3, 1116:24-1117:13 (Greenblatt); JTX 035 at \n8, 10; JTX 093 at 4. A skilled artisan would also have known at the time that co\u00ad\nadministration of ramelteon with rifampin decreases ramelteon's exposure and thus \nits efficacy. Tr. at 1046:5-1047:5, 1116:24-1117:13 (Greenblatt); see also JTX \n035 at 10; JTX 093 at 4. \nI. Prior Art \n1. Hack \n101) Hack is a scientific article titled \"The Effects of Low-Dose 0.5-mg \nMelatonin on the Free-Running Circadian Rhythms of Blind Subjects.\" JTX 146. \n102) Hack was published in 2003 and therefore qualifies as prior art to the \nasserted patents. JTX 146; Tr. at 718:24-719:15 (Emens). \n103) Hack discloses a study in which low dosages of exogenous melatonin \nadministered to blind patients with Non-24 resulted in successful entrainment to \n24-hour sleep-wake cycles. JTX 146 at 1; Tr. at 719:16-20, 804:8-20 (Emens). \n104) Hack further discloses that these patients slept an average of 6.6 hours \nper night, with a standard deviation of 1.1 hours. JTX 146 at 6; Tr. at 804:21-\n28 805:5 (Emens). Thus, Hack teaches that some of these patients slept between 7 \nand 9 hours. \n105) Hack explains that \"[t]he aim of developing melatonin treatment \nregimens to entrain the underlying circadian oscillator is to optimally treat the \nclinical 'non-24-h sleep-wake disorder' condition that develops as a result of \nmisalignment of the circadian system with the social 24-h day.\" JTX 146 at 8. \n106) Hack states that \"several recent studies have reexamined the ability of \nmelatonin to entrain free-running rhythms in totally blind people and found that \nentrainment could be achieved following daily oral melatonin treatment\" with \ndoses including 5, 10, and 0.5 milligrams of melatonin. JTX 146 at 2. \n107) Hack also states that \"[p]revious studies have shown that chronic \nusage of melatonin is necessary for free-running blind people to remain entrained \nto the 24-h day.\" JTX 146 at 2. \n108) Hack concludes \"that a daily dose of 0.5 mg melatonin is effective at \nentraining the free-running circadian systems in most of the blind subjects studied\" \nand that\"[ o ]ptimal treatment with melatonin for this non-24-h sleep disorder \nshould correct the underlying circadian disorder (to entrain the sleep-wake cycle).\" \nJTX 146 at 1. \n109) An artisan of ordinary skill would have understood from Hack in \nJanuary 2012 that exogenous melatonin can be administered to entrain a patient \n29 with Non-24 to a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle where the patient sleeps for \napproximately seven to nine hours. Tr. at 803:8-16 (Emens). \n2. Lankford \n110) Lankford, titled \"Tasimelteon for Insomnia,\" is a prior art scientific \narticle published in 2011. DTX 020.1 As its title suggests, Lankford discloses the \nuse oftasimelteon to treat insomnia. Tr. at 798:24-799:2 (Emens). \n111) Lankford discloses that tasimelteon \"has high affinity for both the \nMTl and MT2 receptors, both in ranges similar to that of melatonin\" with \"already \ndemonstrated ... circadian phase-resetting effects\" in the clinical trial setting. \nDTX 020 at 6. \n112) Lankford concludes that tasimelteon should therefore \"be especially \nwell suited for treatment of' circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRDs). DTX 020 \nat 6. \n1 Vanda argued for the first time, and only in cursory fashion, in its post-trial brief \nthat Lankford \"is not even prior art\" \"because it represents Vanda's own work and \nwas published in May of 2011, less than a year before the priority date of the \nRE604 Patent.\" D .I. 31 7 at 16. Vanda cited no facts to support this assertion and \nit did not object at trial or before trial to the introduction of Lankford into evidence \nor to Dr. Emens's reliance on Lankford as prior art. Vanda forfeited its right to \nargue that Lankford does not constitute prior art by not raising it in timely fashion, \nby failing to object to Lankford's admission at trial, and by the passing manner in \nwhich it raised the argument in its post-trial brief. \n30 113) Lankford discloses several clinical studies in which 20 and 50 \nmilligram doses of tasimelteon were administered to healthy volunteers and \npatients with insomnia 30 minutes before bedtime. DTX 020 at 5. \n114) Lankford also disclosed the existence of Vanda's clinical trial for \nHetlioz\u00ae, which it described as \"an ongoing Phase III trial oftasimelteon in blind \npeople with no light perception and with non-24 h[our] sleep-wake disorder\" that \nis \"designed to assess the effectiveness of 20 mg [ of] tasimelteon.\" DTX 020 at 6; \nTr. at 799:8-15 (Emens). \n115) Because a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that \nNon-24 was a type of circadian rhythm disorder and that one way of \"treating\" a \ncircadian rhythm disorder was entraining the patient with a melatonin agonist to \nphase shift, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand Lankford as \nteaching or suggesting that tasimelteon could likely entrain blind patients with \nNon-24. Tr. at 803:17-804:7 (Emens). \n3. Hardeland \n116) Hardeland is a 2009 prior art reference titled \"Tasimelteon, a \nmelatonin agonist for the treatment of insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep \ndisorders.\" DTX 016; Tr. at 729:21-730:2 (Emens). \n117) Hardeland discloses that \"[t]he chronobiotic effects of melatonin are \npredominantly exerted through its binding to the G-protein-coupled melatonin \n31 receptors,\" MTl and MT2, which Hardeland says are \"located in the \nsuprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which acts as the circadian pacemaker.\" DTX 016 \nat 1. \n118) Hardeland further discloses that \" [ m ]elatonin has been used to treat \nvarious circadian and sleep disorders\" and that \"[s]uch treatments are particularly \nsuccessful if the primary objective is to readjust the circadian phase.\" DTX 016 at \n2. \n119) Hardeland describes tasimelteon as \"a melatonin receptor agonist'' and \n\"an investigational melatonergic drug\" that is \"being developed for the treatment \nof insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders and depression.\" DTX 016 at 1-2. \n120) Hardeland states that \"current knowledge indicates that tasimelteon is \nsuitable for phase-shifting the circadian clock.\" DTX 016 at 8. \n121) Hardeland states that tasimelteon \"may be useful in the treatment of \nsleep disturbances related to circadian rhythm sleep disorders\" or \"other types of \nentrainment difficulties\" and observes that \"[t]hese properties are expected from a \nmelatonergic drug\" and have \"also [been] observed with melatonin.\" DTX 016 at \n7. \n122) Hardeland discloses Vanda's Phase III clinical trial in which \ntasimelteon was administered 30 minutes before bedtime in dosages of 20, 50, and \n100 milligrams. DTX 016 at 6. \n32 123) Hardeland further discloses that tasimelteon and ramelteon have \n\"structural similarity ... as [both] compounds share the dihydrobenzofuran \nstructure and the propanamide residue\" DTX 0 16 at 3-4. \n124) Harde land states that \" [a] study using microsomes that overexpress \nspecific CYP isoenzymes suggested that tasimelteon was primarily metabolized by \nthe CYP1A2 ... isoenzyme[] .... \" DTX 016 at 4. \n125) Hardeland also discloses that \"tasimelteon is metabolized by the CYP \nisoenzyme[] 1A2\" and that because of that phenomenon \"coadministration of any \ndrug that inhibits [this] isoenzyme[] should be regarded with caution.\" DTX 016 \nat 6. \n126) An artisan of ordinary skill would have understood from Hardeland as \nof January 2012 that tasimelteon acts as a melatonin agonist receptor that can \nphase shift the circadian clock and, through that mechanism, can treat by \nentrainment circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Tr. at 730: 17-19, 811 :24-812:9 \n(Emens). \n12 7) A skilled artisan would also have understood from Hardeland in \nJanuary 2012 that \"[e]ffective doses oftasimelteon were in th[e] 20-to 50-\nmilligram range\" 30 minutes before bedtime. Tr. at 812:18-813:9 (Emens). \n33 4. Pandi-Perumal \n128) Pandi-Perumal is a 2011 prior art reference titled \"Pharmacotherapy \nof Insomnia with Ramelteon: Safety, Efficacy and Clinical Applications.\" JTX \n093. \n129) Pandi-Perumal discloses the use of ramelteon, a melatonin receptor \nagonist, for the treatment of insomnia. JTX 093 at 1-2. \n130) Pandi-Perumal discloses that potential off-label uses of ramelteon \ninclude treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders. JTX 093 at 1. \n131) Pandi-Perumal teaches that ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist \nthat specifically acts through the MTl and MT2 melatonin receptors. JTX 093 at \n1-2. \n132) Pandi-Perumal reports that ramelteon was developed in part to have a \nmelatonin receptor agonist with a longer half-life than melatonin, which has an \napproximately 30-minute half-life. JTX 093 at 3. \n13 3) Pandi-Perumal discloses that the half-life of circulating ramelteon is \none to two hours, depending on the dose. JTX 093 at 3. \n134) Pandi-Perumal teaches that ramelteon is metabolized by CYP1A2, \nCYP2C19, and CYP3A4. JTX 093 at 4; Tr. at 1038:25-1039:13 (Greenblatt). \nAccording to Pandi-Perumal, \"[i]n view of the fact that ramelteon is mainly \n34 metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2Cl9, drugs that inhibit these enzymes can \nconsiderably increase the levels of the agonist.'' JTX 093 at 4. \n135) Pandi-Perumal expressly warns that \"ramelteon should not be used in \ncombination with fluvoxamine [or] ciprofloxacin.\" JTX 093 at 4. \n136) Pandi-Perumal further states that the \"CYP inducer rifampin has been \nshown to considerably decrease levels of both ramelteon and its metabolite M-II\" \nand that \"[t]o avoid losses in efficacy, this and other strong upregulators of \nrelevant CYP enzymes should be avoided.\" JTX 093 at 4; Tr. at 1051 :6--11 \n(Greenblatt). \n5. The #244 Publication \n13 7) Vanda filed the #244 Publication (International Patent Application \nNumber WO 2007/137244) on May 22, 2006. DTX 041. \n138) The #244 Publication is a prior art reference because it was published \non November 29, 2007. DTX 041; Tr. at 726:12-727:8 (Emens). \n139) The #244 Publication is directed to \"a method of administering MA-1 \nto a human subject in need thereof which comprises orally administering MA-1 to \nthe subject in an amount of about 10 mg to about 100 mg per day.\" DTX 041 at 3. \n140) The #244 Publication describes its inventive subject matter as \npertaining to the \"use of the melatonin agonist herein referred to as MA-1, to treat \nsleep disorders and circadian rhythm disorders.\" DTX 041 at 3. \n35 141) MA-1 is tasimelteon. Tr. at 727:13-14 (Emens). \n142) The #244 Publication discloses that \"MA-1 is a specific and potent \nagonist of the MTlR and MT2R melatonin receptors in the Suprachiasmatic \nnucleus (SCN), the region of the brain associated with the biological clock. \nEngagement of these receptors by melatonin is believed to regulate circadian \nrhythms, including the sleep/wake cycle. Consistent with its receptor binding \nprofile, MA-1 demonstrates potent chronobiotic activity in preclinical models of \nacute phase-shifting and chronic re-entrainment.\" DTX 041 at 2. \n143) The #244 Publication describes several clinical studies assessing the \nsafety and efficacy of tasimelteon and concludes from these studies that \ntasimelteon \"was well-tolerated at doses of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg.\" DTX 041 at \n23. \n144) The #244 Publication concludes that \"[a]n oral dose of about 20 to \nabout 50 mg [oftasimelteon] is effective in treating sleep disorders when \nadministered about 1/2 hour before sleep time.\" DTX 041 at 24. \n145) The #244 Publication explains that treatment with tasimelteon \"is \ncontinued until the patient's circadian rhythm is restored to normal, i.e., until the \npatient's normal daily function is not inhibited by the underlying circadian rhythm \ndisorder.\" DTX 041 at 5-6. It goes on to state that treatment with tasimelteon \n36 \"can continue for some time after these end points are achieved so as to lessen the \nlikelihood of relapse.\" DTX 041 at 6. \n146) Claim 5 of the #244 Publication claims administering tasimelteon \"to \ntreat or prevent a circadian rhythm disorder or a sleep disorder.\" DTX 041 at 25. \nClaim 8 of the #244 Publication depends from claim 7 and specifies that the \ntasimelteon is \"administered at about 0.5 hours prior to bedtime.\" DTX 041 at 25. \n14 7) Claim 9 of the #244 Publication depends from claim 8 and specifies \nthat the tasimelteon \"is orally administered at a dose of about 20 mg/day or about \n50 mg/day.\" DTX 041 at 26. \n148) An artisan of ordinary skill would have understood from the #244 \nPublication as of January 2012 that tasimelteon administered in doses of 20 to 50 \nmilligrams about a half hour before bedtime can reset a patient's circadian clock \nand cause entrainment. Tr. at 727:15-22 (Emens). \nJ. The Relevant Teachings and Suggestions of the Prior Art \nCombinations Asserted by Defendants to Invalidate Claim 3 of the \nRE604 Patent \n149) Defendants argue that claim 3 of the RE604 patent is invalid as \nobvious in light of the combinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, and the #244 \nPublication and (2) Hack, Hardeland, and the #244 Publication. \n37 1. \"A method of entraining a patient suffering from Non-24 to \na 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in which the patient awakens at \nor near a target wake time following a daily sleep period of \napproximately 7 to 9 hours\" \n150) The combinations of Hack, Lankford, and the #244 Publication and of \nHack, Hardeland, and the #244 Publication each teach or suggest that \"entraining a \npatient suffering from Non-24 to a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in which the patient \nawakens at or near a target wake time following a daily sleep period of \napproximately seven to nine hours.\" Tr. at 803:8-16; 811 :24-812:1 (Emens). \n151) As noted above, an artisan of ordinary skill would have understood in \nJanuary 2012 that Hack disclosed administering exogenous melatonin to entrain a \npatient with Non-24 to a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle where the patient sleeps for \napproximately seven to nine hours. Tr. at 803:8-16 (Emens). A skilled artisan \nwould have understood that Lankford taught or suggested at that time that \ntasimelteon could likely entrain blind patients with Non-24. Tr. at 803:17-804:7 \n(Emens ). An artisan would have understood from Hardeland as of January 2012 \nthat tasimelteon acts as a melatonin agonist receptor that can phase shift the \ncircadian clock and, through that mechanism, can treat by entrainment circadian \nrhythm sleep disorders. And a skilled artisan would have known from the #244 \nPublication that tasimelteon administered in doses of 20 to 50 milligrams about a \nhalf hour before bedtime can reset a patient's circadian clock and cause \nentrainment. Tr. at 727:15-22 (Emens). \n38 2. \"and maintaining said 24-hour sleep-wake cycle\" \n152) Both Hack and the #244 Publication teach maintaining a 24-hour \nsleep-wake cycle. As noted above, Hack teaches that chronic usage of melatonin is \nnecessary for free-running blind people to remain entrained to the 24-hour day, and \nthe #244 Publication teaches that treatment with tasimelteon should be continued \nuntil normal circadian rhythm is restored and that this treatment can continue for \nsome time to reduce the likelihood of relapse. See also Tr. at 805: 18-806: 11 \n(Emens). \n3. \"orally administering to the patient 20 mg of tasimelteon\" \n153) As noted above, the oral administration of 20 milligrams of \ntasimelteon is disclosed in Lankford, Hardeland, and the #244 Publication. \n4. \"0.5 to 1.5 hours before the target bedtime\" \n154) As noted above, Lankford, Hardeland, and the #244 Publication all \nteach the administration oftasimelteon 0.5 to 1.5 hours before the target bedtime. \n5. \"wherein the patient is totally blind\" \n155) As noted above, Hack and Lankford disclose treatment of blind \npeople. See also Tr. at 808:22-809:13 (Emens). \n39 K. Findings Relating to A Skilled Artisan's Motivation to Combine \nDefendants' Asserted Prior Art References for Claim 3 of the \nRE604 Patent and Expectation of Success \n156) I find that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the \nHack and #244 Publication references with the Lankford reference, Hardeland \nreference, or both references. \n157) With respect to the Hack, Lankford, and #244 Publication \ncombination, I base this finding on the disclosures of the references discussed \nabove and the following testimony of Dr. Emens, whom I found to be very \ncredible: \n... [T]he Hack publication that tells me that \nmelatonin can entrain individuals with Non-24. So I \nknow melatonin can achieve the desired treatment effect. \nThen I have Lankford and the [ #]244 Publication \ntelling me that I have a drug, tasimelteon, that's acting on \nthe same types of receptors, melatonin receptors. They \npoint out that it has the exact same mechanism and the \naction; namely, it can reset the timing of the biological \nclock. It can cause these phase shifts. And furthermore \nthat it can cause entrainment. \nAnd, finally, that it would probably be an effective \ntreatment for, as they point out there, numerous circadian \nrhythm sleep disorders, such as Non-24. So I think they \nhave a really clear motivation to want to combine them. \nTr. at 810:4-19 (Emens). \n40 158) With respect to the combination of the Hack, Hardeland, and the #244 \nPublication, I base this finding on the disclosures of the references noted above and \nthe following testimony from Dr. Emens: \n[W]e know from Hack that melatonin can entrain blind \nindividuals with Non-24. [The] [#]244 Publication and \nHardeland tell me I have a drug, tasimelteon, that binds \nin a way similar to melatonin, can cause those same \nphase shifts as melatonin, and can be useful for \nentrainment, which, again, is what Hack had shown with \nmelatonin. And so, clearly, there would have been \nmotivation to combine these references. \nTr. at 813:19-814:7 (Emens). \n159) I similarly find, based on the disclosures of the references discussed \nabove and Dr. Emens's testimony, that an artisan of ordinary skill would have had \nas of the priority date of the RE604 patent a reasonable expectation of success in \nentraining a totally blind patient with Non-24 by combining the teachings of the \nHack, Lankford, and the #244 Publication. As Dr. Emens explained, \"Lankford \nkind of really spells it out for us\" as \"Lankford talks about how tasimelteon should \nbe especially well[-]suited for the treatment of circadian rhythm disorders. And, \nagain, the [ #]244 Publication similarly says it should be effective in treating sleep \ndisorders.\" Tr. at 810:25-811:1-5 (Emens). Lankford's disclosure of Vanda's \nPhase III trial would also have contributed to a skilled artisan's expectation of \nsuccess. As Dr. Emens explained: \n41 [I]f someone is going to be spending the time and money \nto do a big Phase 3 trial, all that effort, as well as money, \nthen that would say to me, and to a person of ordinary \nskill in the art, that clearly there was a reasonable \nexpectation that they are going to succeed. Otherwise, I \ndon't think they would have invested the time and money \nin the Phase 3 trial. \nTr. at 811:10-16 (Emens). \n160) I similarly find, based on the disclosures discussed above and the \nfollowing testimony from Dr. Emens, that a skilled artisan would have had a \nreasonable expectation of success in combining the teachings of Hack, Hardeland, \nand the #244 Publication to successfully entrain a totally blind patient who suffers \nfrom Non-24: \n... Hardeland points out quite explicitly that \ntasimelteon should be useful for treating circadian \nrhythm sleep disorders explicitly. As well as, and, again, \nthis is important, other types of entrainment difficulties. \nSo Hardeland calls out that it would be useful for \nentrainment specifically. And what's interesting is that \nHardeland says you would expect this based on the fact \nthat it's a melatonin (inaudible), meaning it's a melatonin \nagonist. So Hardeland is clearly not surprised here by \nthat. \nAnd also ... Hardeland concludes that, again, \ntasimelteon should be appropriate for phase shifting the \ncircadian clock and resetting the time after the 24-hour \nbiological clock. And, therefore, should be useful in the \ntreatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders. And then \nas I stated before, the [ #]244 culls out that it should be \neffective in treating sleep disorders. \n42 Tr. at 814:11-815:3 (Emens). \nL. Findings Relevant to the Prior Art Combinations Asserted by \nDefendants to Invalidate Claim 14 of the #829 Patent \n161) Defendants argue that claim 14 of the #829 patent is invalid as \nobvious in light of the combinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, the #244 Publication, \nand Hardeland and (2) Hack, the #244 Publication, and Hardeland. \n1. \"A method of treating a patient for [Non-24-Hour Sleep\u00ad\nWake] disorder ... with 20 mg of tasimelteon once daily\" \n162) I have already found that the combinations of ( 1) Hack, Lankford, and \nthe #244 Publication and (2) Hack, the #244 Publication, and Hardeland each teach \nthe treatment of patients with 20 milligrams oftasimelteon once daily; that a \nskilled artisan would have been motivated to combine respectively these \nreferences; and that a skilled artisan would reasonably have expected that such \ntreatment would succeed. \n2. \"wherein the patient is being treated with a strong CYP1A2 \ninhibitor selected from a group consisting of fluvoxamine, \nciprofloxacin, and verapamil, the method comprising ... \ndiscontinuing treatment with the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor\" \n163) I have already found that Harde land discloses that tasimelteon is \nprimarily metabolized by CYP1A2 and that Hardeland expressly cautions against \nthe administration of any drug with tasimelteon that inhibits CYP1A2. \n164) An artisan of ordinary skill who intended to administer tasimelteon to \na patient who was already taking a CYP1A2 inhibitor would have expected that \n43 tasimelteon should not be co-administered with a CYP1A2 inhibitor and would \nhave heeded Hardeland's warning against co-administering tasimelteon and \nCYP1A2 inhibitors, especially in light of the well-known drug-drug interaction \nbetween ramelteon and fluvoxamine. Tr. at 1043:18-1046:4, 1116:24-1117:13 \n(Greenblatt); see also DTX 028 at 9; JTX 093 at 4; JTX 035 at 10. Thus, a skilled \nartisan would have found it obvious to discontinue treatment of a patient with a \nstrong CYP 1A2 inhibitor such as fluvoxamine before treating that patient with \ntasimelteon. Tr. at 1049:3-1050:19 (Greenblatt). \nM. Findings Relevant to the Prior Art Combinations Asserted by \nDefendants to Invalidate Claim 4 of the #910 Patent \n165) Defendants argue that claim 4 of the #910 patent is invalid as obvious \nin light of the combinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, the #244 Publication, and \nPandi-Perumal and (2) Hack, the #244 Publication, Hardeland, and Pandi-Perumal. \n1. \"A method of treating a [light perception impaired] patient \nfor [Non-24] disorder ... with ... 20 mg of tasimelteon \nonce daily before a target bedtime\" \n166) I have already found that the combinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, and \nthe #244 Publication and (2) Hack, the #244 Publication, and Hardeland each teach \nthe treatment of light perception impaired (i.e., blind) patients suffering from Non-\n24 with 20 milligrams of tasimelteon once daily before a target bedtime; that a \nskilled artisan would have been motivated to combine respectively these \n44 references; and that a skilled artisan would reasonably have expected that such \ntreatment would succeed. \n2. \"wherein the patient is being treated with rifampicin, the \nmethod comprising: (A) discontinuing the rifampicin \ntreatment and then (B) treating the patient with \ntasimelteon, thereby avoiding the use of tasimelteon in \ncombination with rifampicin and also thereby avoiding \nreduced exposure to tasimelteon caused by induction of \nCYP3A4 by rifampicin\" \n167) I have already found that Pandi-Perumal teaches that (1) ramelteon is \na melatonin receptor agonist that specifically acts through the MT 1 and MT2 \nmelatonin receptors; (2) ramelteon is metabolized by CYP3A4; (3) ramelteon \nshould not be used in combination with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin; ( 4) the CYP \ninducer rifampin has been shown to considerably decrease levels of both ramelteon \nand its metabolite M-II; and (5) to avoid losses in efficacy, relevant CYP enzymes \nshould be avoided when administering ramelteon. \n168) I have already found that an artisan of ordinary skill would have \nunderstood in January 2012 that drug-drug interactions are predictable, and the \nartisan would have looked to ramelteon to predict tasimelteon drug-drug \ninteractions because of the many known similarities between ramelteon and \ntasimelteon, including the fact that ramelteon and tasimelteon have similar \nstructures, half-life durations, and affinities for melatonin receptors (MTl and \nMT2). \n45 169) I have already found that an artisan of ordinary skill would have \nknown that ramelteon is metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, that ramelteon's \nin vivo metabolism resulted in large drug-drug interactions with fluvoxamine ( a \nCYP1A2 inhibitor) and rifampin (a CYP3A4 inducer), that ramelteon undergoes an \n80 percent decrease in blood plasma levels when it is co-administered with the \nCYP3A4 inducer rifampin, and that co-administration of ramelteon with rifampin \nresults in decreased exposure and thus efficacy. \n170) In light of Pandi-Perumal and the well-known similarities between \nramelteon and tasimelteon, if, as of January 2012, a skilled artisan wanted to \nadminister tasimelteon to a patient who was already taking the CYP3A4 rifampin, \nthen the artisan would have expected that tasimelteon should not be co\u00ad\nadministered with rifampin and would have thought it necessary and obvious to \nstop treating the patient with rifampin before treating the patient with tasimelteon. \nSee Tr. at 1035:7-18, 1037:5-18, 1040:6-24, 1046:5-1047:5 1047:23-1048:19, \n1050:20-1052:2 (Greenblatt); see also DTX 016 at 3-5; JTX 035 at 1, 3, 10; JTX \n093 at 4. \nN. Findings Relevant to the Prior Art Combinations Asserted by \nDefendants to Invalidate Claim 5 of the #487 Patent \n171) Defendants argue that claim 5 of the #487 patent is invalid as \nobvious in light of the combinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, and the #244 \nPublication and (2) Hack, Hardeland, and the #244 Publication. \n46 1. \"A method of treating a human patient suffering from [Non-\n24] disorder ... that comprises orally administering to the \npatient an effective dose of tasimelteon ... wherein the \neffective dose is 20 mg/d. \n172) I have already found that the combinations of ( 1) Hack, Lankford, \nand the #244 Publication and (2) Hack, Hardeland, and the #244 Publication each \nteach the treatment ofNon-24 patients with 20 milligrams oftasimelteon once \ndaily; that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine respectively \nthese references; and that a skilled artisan would reasonably have expected that \nsuch treatment would succeed. \n2. \"without food\" \n173) The parties stipulated that for purposes of the #487 patent, \"without \nfood\" means \"the patient has not consumed food within 30 minutes prior to \nadministration of tasimelteon and does not consume food with the administration \noftasimelteon.\" D.I. 183 at 3. \n174) The #244 Publication, Hardeland, and Lankford each disclose \nadministration oftasimelteon 30 minutes before bedtime. See DTX 016 at 6; DTX \n041 at 24; DTX 020 at 5. \n175) Dr. Emens testified credibly that \"it's more likely than not\" that an \nartisan of ordinary skill who was administering tasimelteon within 3 0 minutes of \nthe patient's bedtime would do so \"without food\" and that it would have been \nobvious to an artisan of ordinary skill to administer tasimelteon without food 30 \n47 minutes before bedtime. Tr. at 803:5-23 (Emens). \n0. Alleged Objective Indicia of Nonobviousness \n176) Vanda argues that the nonobviousness of the asserted claims is \ndemonstrated by four \"objective indicia\"-unexpected results, long-felt need, \nindustry praise, and failure of others. \n1. Alleged Unexpected Results of the RE604 Patent \na. Half-Life \n177) Vanda argues that \"[t]asimelteon's relatively long half-life would \nhave led one of skill not to expect that tasimelteon would work for treating Non-24 \nby entrainment.\" D.I. 311 at 38. It cites Lankford in support of this assertion. \n178) Lankford discloses that melatonin had a \"short half-life\" that is \n\"typically in the range 20 -30 min, though sometimes less, with a maximum \nperiod of 45 min\" and that, because of its half-life, \"it is unsurprising that while \nmelatonin has shown some effectiveness, though inconsistently, in treating sleep \nonset insomnia, it has not demonstrated similar effectiveness in the treatment of \nsleep maintenance type insomnia.\" DTX 020 at 4. \n179) But Lankford further disclosed that \"[i]n rats and monkeys, the \nhalf-life of tasimelteon was approximately 2 h[,] which is longer than the half-life \nof melatonin,\" and that \"there has been considerable interest in developing, for the \ntreatment of both sleep onset and maintenance type insomnia either sustained \nrelease forms of melatonin or melatonergic agonists with longer half-lives than \n48 exogenous melatonin.\" DTX 020 at 4. \n180) Lankford concludes that \nDTX 020 at 7. the half-life of melatonin is a relatively short (20-30 \nmin) while the half-life oftasimelteon is apparently \nlonger, at least based on animal studies. The longer \nhalf-life could make tasimelteon more suitable for \ntreating insomnias other than just the sleep onset type. \n181) Accordingly, I find that Lankford does not demonstrate that a \nskilled artisan would not have expected that tasimelteon would work for Non-24 \ntreatment by entrainment. \n182) On the contrary, as I found above and based on the credible \ntestimony of Dr. Emens, a skilled artisan as of January 2012 would have \nunderstood Lankford as teaching or suggesting that tasimelteon could likely entrain \nblind patients with Non-24. \n183) Vanda cites the testimony of Dr. Emens and Dr. Czeisler for the \nproposition that \"[a] longer half-life increases the risk that tasimelteon's effects \nwill 'spill over' into the period when stimulation actually delays the patient's \ncircadian phase, thus counteracting any benefit obtained from advancing the \npatient's circadian phase when the medicine is first administered.\" D.I. 311 at 38. \nThe cited testimony of Dr. Emens, however, established only that at some \nundefined point a dosage of melatonin can be high enough to create \"both kind of \n49 helpful phase advances and unhelpful phase delays\" that would \"counteract each \nother\" and accordingly fail to achieve the phase shift necessary for entrainment. \nTr. at 840:22-843:19 (Emens). Neither that testimony nor Dr. Czeisler's testimony \ncause me to question my finding-based on Dr. Emens's testimony and the \ndisclosures in the prior art discussed above-that a skilled artisan would have \nreasonably expected in January 2012 that tasimelteon would work for treating \nNon-24 by entrainment. (I did not find Dr. Czeisler, especially given his \nsubstantial financial ties to Vanda that were not disclosed until cross-examination, \nto be as credible as Dr. Emens.) \nb. Dosage \n184) Vanda argues \" [ t ]hat 20mg of tasimelteon proved efficacious was \nunexpected.\" D.I. 311 at 38. \n185) As made clear from my finding above, Hardeland, Lankford, and \nVanda itself in the #244 Publication, contradict this contention. \nc. Timing of Administration \n186) Citing only Dr. Czeisler's trial testimony, Vanda contends that \"[i]t \nwas unexpected that success could be obtained administering tasimelteon before \nbedtime, rather than several hours earlier.\" D.I. 311 at 39. \n187) As discussed above, substantial record evidence contradicts this \ncontention. Vanda itself stated in the #244 Publication that tasimelteon should be \n50 administered \"about 1/2 hour before sleep time,\" DTX 041 at 24; see also DTX \n041 at 25-26, and Vanda's prior-art clinical trial protocol instructed that \ntasimelteon should be administered one hour before bedtime. See DTX 042 at 9-\n10; see also DTX 020 at 5; DTX 041 at 10; DTX 016 at 5-6; Tr. at 807:13-808:20, \n812:24-813:9 (Emens). \nd. Phase-Response Curve \n188) Vanda argues that the absence in January 2012 (and still today) of a \nphase-response curve for any dose of tasimelteon means that \"it ... cannot be \ndetermined a priori whether a given dose of tasimelteon at a given time can shift \nor entrain the circadian rhythm\" and thus the results claimed in the RE604 patent \nwere unexpected. D.I. 311 at 39. Vanda argues that this lack of phase-response \ncurve data is important because that data \"are an important first step in determining \nwhen and how much medicine to give.\" D.I. 311 at 39. This assertion is \nirrelevant, as the prior art discussed above uniformly described administering \ntasimelteon shortly before bedtime and also discussed the appropriate dose. \n2. Alleged Unexpected Results of the #487 Patent \n189) Vanda argues that as of the priority date of the #487 patent, \"it \nwould have been unexpected that administration of tasimelteon with food would \ndecrease its efficacy in treating Non-24.\" D.I. 311 at 40. But Vanda cites no \nevidence adduced at trial that shows or suggests in any way what a skilled artisan \n51 in January 2012 would have expected when tasimelteon is administered with and \nwithout food. Accordingly, Vanda's contention about alleged unexpected results \nof administering tasimelteon without food necessarily fails. See Pfizer, Inc. v. \nApotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that \"by definition, \nany superior property must be unexpected to be considered as evidence of non\u00ad\nobviousness\" and that unexpected results \"evidence must fail [it] the record is \ndevoid of any evidence of what the skilled artisan would have expected\") \n( emphasis in the original). \n3. Alleged Unexpected Results of the #910 Patent \n190) Vanda argues that it \"would have been an unexpected result as of \nthe priority date of the [#]910 Patent that tasimelteon should not be co\u00ad\nadministered with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A3 inducer.\" D.I. 311 at 41. \nAccording to Vanda, \"[t]he only source of original data regarding tasimelteon's \nmetabolism concluded '[n]o metabolism ofBMS-214778 was observed following \nincubation with ... [CYP]3A4.\"' D.I. 311 at 41. But, as Dr. Greenblatt credibly \nexplained at trial, a skilled artisan aware of this source of data would not have \n\"exclude[ d] a major role of CYP3A4 in the induced state\" because \"induction \ncauses a massive increase in the amount of enzymes,\" meaning \"you can't exclude \na major role of CYP3A4 in the induced state even if you can't detect it in the \nuninduced state.\" Tr. at 1116: 13-20 (Greenblatt). A skilled artisan would have \n52 been particularly likely to suspect a potential interaction between tasimelteon and \nstrong CYP3A4 inducers given the knowledge in the art that (i) the structurally \nanalogous compound ramelteon exhibited a \"large\" drug-drug interaction with \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors, Tr. at 1116:21-1117: 13 (Greenblatt), and (ii) CYP3A4 \nresides in the gastrointestinal tract, is the \"most abundant\" enzyme in the liver, and \nmetabolizes a large percentage of drugs. See Tr. at 1050:20-1052:2 (Greenblatt); \nTr. at 1146:19-25 (Parkinson). \n191) In addition, for the reasons discussed above, I find that a skilled \nartisan would have expected that tasimelteon should not be co-administered with \nrifampin. \n4. Alleged Unexpected Results of the #829 Patent \n192) Vanda argues: \nWhile here the sole piece of prior art taught that CYP1A2 \nwas one of the four enzymes 'primarily' responsible for \ntasimelteon in an in vitro laboratory test, the undisputed \nrecord evidence from both parties' experts is that a \nskilled artisan could not determine from that lone fact \nwhether to avoid administering tasimelteon and a strong \nCYP1A2 inhibitor, or whether to increase or decrease the \ndose of one or the other, or whether no adjustment is \nneeded. FDA draft guidelines for that decision require at \nleast one more type of in vitro assay and in vivo data. \nD.I. 311 at 41-42 (citations omitted). \n193) I understand Vanda's argument to be that without in vivo tests, a \nskilled artisan could not have known with certainty whether the co-administration \n53 oftasimelteon and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided. That may be \ntrue, but I will make no finding of fact to that effect because it has no bearing on \nthe issues before me. See Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364 (holding that \"obviousness \ncannot be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the \nart so long as there was a reasonable probability of success\" and that \"the \nexpectation of success need only be reasonable, not absolute\"). \n194) For the reasons discussed above, I have already found that an \nartisan of ordinary skill would have expected that tasimelteon should not be co\u00ad\nadministered with a CYP1A2 inhibitor and would have heeded Hardeland's \nwarning against co-administering tasimelteon and CYP1A2 inhibitors, especially \nin light of the well-known drug-drug interaction between ramelteon and \nfluvoxamine. \n5. Alleged Long-Felt Need of the Claimed Non-24 Treatment \n195) Vanda argues that \"[b]efore [it] invented the method of claim 3 of \nthe Non-24-Treatment Patent, there was a long-felt, unmet need for a safe and \neffective treatment for Non-24, particularly in patients in whom melatonin was not \neffective.\" D.I. 311 at 42. \n196) The record evidence Vanda cites in support of this assertion does \nnot demonstrate a long-felt need for the treatment method claimed in claim 3 of the \nRE604 patent. \n54 197) Vanda first cites Dr. Combs's testimony about an article he \nauthored in 2019-i.e., the year after this case was filed and seven years after the \npriority date of the RE604 patent. See D.I. 311 at 42 (citing Tr. at 203:2-203:16 \n(Combs)). The article recounts the successful treatment of one adolescent Non-24 \npatient who had previously been treated unsuccessfully with melatonin. Given the \ndate of the article and the fact that it discusses only one patient's experience, the \narticle fails to show a long-felt need for the claimed treatment. \n198) The remaining record evidence cited by Vanda, see D.I. 311 at 43, \nis cursory at best and suggests at most that there was some need among Non-24 \npatients for whom melatonin had not worked for another drug; it does not suggest \nthat there was a need for a specific method of using that drug. Moreover, as Dr. \nEmens credibly testified, by 2003 melatonin was viewed in the field as effective \ntreatment for Non-24. See Tr. at 716:2-721 :4 (Emens); Tr. at 1217:14-23 \n(Emens); see also JTX 146 at 1 (stating that Rack's \"findings demonstrate that a \ndaily dose of 0.5 mg melatonin is effective at entraining the free-running circadian \nsystems in most of the blind subjects studied\"). \n6. Alleged Industry Praise for the Claimed Non-24 Treatment \n199) Vanda points to various examples of praise it has received from \nindustry groups and organizations that support the blind. But it does not cite any \npraise specifically directed at the treatment method claimed in the RE604 patent. \n55 Accordingly, I find that whatever industry praise Vanda received is of minimal \nprobative value with respect to the obviousness of the claimed method. \n7. Alleged Failure of Others to Develop the Claimed Non-24 \nTreatment \n200) Vanda argues that \"melatonin researchers\" had failed to \ndemonstrate in a large-scale study that melatonin can effectively entrain Non-24 \npatients and that \"no one has ever entrained a patient using 20mg of melatonin[.]\" \nD.I. 311 at 45. But, as I have already found above, it was well-known in the field \nas of 2000 that melatonin could entrain Non-24 blind patients to a normal 24-hour \nsleep-wake cycle. The absence of a large-scale study does not refute that finding. \nAnd the fact that the effective dose of tasimelteon turned out to be different than \nthe effective dose of melatonin is of no moment. \n201) Vanda also argues that \"BMS [Bristol Myers Squibb] failed to \ndevelop any successful treatment using tasimelteon.\" D.I. 311 at 45. But Vanda \ncites nothing in the record that shows that BMS ever tried to develop tasimelteon \nto treat Non-24. \n8. Alleged Failure to Recognize CYP3A4 Metabolism \n202) Vanda argues that \"BMS also failed to recognize that tasimelteon is \nmetabolized by CYP3A4.\" D.I. 311 at 46. But here again, Vanda cites no record \nevidence that BMS ever tried to develop the claimed method of the #910 patent. \n56 III. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Direct Infringement \nAnalyzing infringement involves two steps. The first step is to construe \ndisputed patent terms consistent with how they would be understood by an artisan \nof ordinary skill. Phillips v. AWHCorp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en \nbane). The second step is to determine whether the accused products or methods \ninfringe the patent by comparing those products or methods to the construed \nclaims. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. Cir. 1995) \n(en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 (1996). The first step in the infringement analysis is \na question of law; the second is a question of fact. Glaxo, Inc. v. Novopharm, Ltd., \n110 F.3d 1562, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A patentee bears the burden of proving \ninfringement by a preponderance of the evidence. Envirotech Corp. v. Al George, \nInc., 730 F.2d 753, 758 (Fed. Cir. 1984). \nAs noted above, \u00a7 271 ( e )(2)(A) of the Patent Act defines the filing of an \nANDA with a paragraph IV certification as an act of infringement. That definition \n\"create[s] case or controversy jurisdiction to enable a court to promptly resolve any \ndispute concerning infringement and validity\" of patents listed in the Orange Book. \nGlaxo, 110 F.3d at 1569. \"Notwithstanding this defined act of infringement, a \ndistrict court's inquiry in a suit brought under\u00a7 271(e)(2) is the same as it is in any \nother infringement suit, viz., whether the patent in question is 'invalid or will not be \n57 irifringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug for which the [ANDA] is \nsubmitted.\"' Id. (italics and alteration in original) ( underline added) ( quoting 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV)). Thus, \"the ultimate infringement question is \ndetermined by traditional patent law principles and, if a product that an ANDA \napplicant is asking the FDA to approve for sale falls within the scope of an issued \npatent, a judgment of infringement must necessarily ensue.\" Sunovion Pharms., \nInc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d 1271, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2013). By the \nsame token, if the product that an ANDA applicant is asking the FDA to approve \nfalls outside the scope of an asserted patent, a judgment of noninfringement must \nfollow. In short, \"[w]hat [the ANDA applicant] has asked the FDA to approve as a \nregulatory matter is the subject matter that determines whether infringement will \noccur.\" Id. \nThe infringement analysis in an ANDA case is most straightforward when \nthe ANDA's specification directly addresses the elements of the asserted claims \nthat are at issue. \"Because drug manufacturers are bound by strict statutory \nprovisions to sell only those products that comport with the ANDA's description of \nthe drug, an ANDA specification defining a proposed generic drug in a manner \nthat directly addresses the issue of infringement will control the infringement \ninquiry.\" Abbott Lab'ys v. TorPharm, Inc., 300 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \n58 As the Federal Circuit explained in Bayer AG v. Elan Pharmaceutical Research \nCorp., 212 F.3d 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2000): \nIf any of the statements in [the ANDA's] specification \nare false, [the ANDA filer] is subject to civil penalties \nand the withdrawal of the approval of its drug. \nAdditionally, if [the ANDA filer] introduces a drug into \ninterstate commerce without complying with the \napproval requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355, it is subject to \nvarious additional penalties, including an injunction, \ncriminal sanctions, seizure of the unapproved drug, and \ndebarment of its corporation and individual officials from \nsubmitting or assisting in the submission of an ANDA in \nthe future. [The ANDA filer] also would be subject to \ncriminal prosecution for making false statements to the \nFDA under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, conspiring to defraud the \nUnited States under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and obstructing \nproceedings before a federal agency under 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1501. If [the ANDA filer] changes its ANDA, it must \nfile the changes with the FDA, and if the changes are to \nthe drug's specification, [the ANDA filer] must obtain \napproval for the changes before they can be made. \nId. at 1249-50 (citations omitted). Because of these statutory and regulatory \nrequirements and the consequences that flow from failing to abide by them, courts \n\"cannot assume that [an ANDA filer] will not act in full compliance with its \nrepresentations to the FDA.\" In re Brimonidine Pat. Litig., 643 F.3d 1366, 1378 \n(Fed. Cir. 2011). \nThis principle that an ANDA filer is bound by the representations and \nspecifications in its ANDA is central to the infringement inquiry. And if an \nANDA specification describes a product that either necessarily infringes an \n59 asserted patent or necessarily does not infringe the patent, the specification dictates \nthe outcome of the infringement analysis. See Perring B. V. v. Watson Lab 'ys, Inc\u00ad\nFla., 764 F.3d 1401, 1408 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\"In some cases, the ANDA \nspecification directly resolves the infringement question because it defines a \nproposed generic product in a manner that either meets the limitations of an \nasserted patent claim or is outside the scope of such a claim.\"); Elan, 212 F.3d at \n1249 (finding that an ANDA specification that clearly defined a noninfringing \nproduct \"mandate[ d] a finding of no literal infringement\"). \nWhen the ANDA specification does not answer the question of \ninfringement, \"[t]he relevant inquiry is whether the patentee has proven by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the alleged infringer will likely market an \ninfringing product.\" Glaxo, 110 F.3d at 1570. In such cases, \"[w]hat is likely to \nbe sold, or, preferably, what will be sold, will ultimately determine whether \ninfringement exists.\" Id. \nB. Induced Infringement \n\"Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an \ninfringer.\" 3 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 271 (b ). A finding of inducement requires establishing an \nunderlying act of direct infringement, the defendant's knowledge of or willful \nblindness with respect to the direct infringement, and that the defendant's specific \nintent was to encourage the acts that constituted direct infringement. See DSU \n60 Med. Corp. v. JMS Co., 471 F.3d 1293, 1303, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en bane in \nrelevant part). \nC. Obviousness \nUnder\u00a7 103 of the Patent Act, a patent \"may not be obtained ... if the \ndifferences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are \nsuch that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the \ninvention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said \nsubject matter pertains.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (2006). \nAs the Supreme Court explained in the seminal case Graham v. John Deere \nCo., 383 U.S. 1 (1966), under\u00a7 103, \"[a]n invention which has been made, and \nwhich is new in the sense that the same thing has not been made before, may still \nnot be patentable if the difference between the new thing and what was known \nbefore is not considered sufficiently great to warrant a patent.\" Id. at 14. Section \n103 ensures that \"the results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive \nrights under the patent laws.\" KSR lnt'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 427 \n(2007). \"Were it otherwise patents might stifle, rather than promote, the progress \nof useful arts.\" Id. (citing U.S. Const. art. I,\u00a7 8, cl. 8). \nThe Court reaffirmed in KSR that the \"framework\" set out in the following \nparagraph from Graham governs the application of\u00a7 103, id. at 406: \nWhile the ultimate question of patent validity is one of \nlaw, the[\u00a7] 103 condition [of patentability] ... lends \n61 itself to several basic factual inquiries. Under[\u00a7] 103, \nthe scope and content of the prior art are to be \ndetermined; differences between the prior art and the \nclaims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of \nordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this \nbackground, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the \nsubject matter is determined. Such secondary \nconsiderations as commercial success, long felt but \nunsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized \nto give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin \nof the subject matter sought to be patented. As indicia of \nobviousness or nonobviousness, these inquiries may have \nrelevancy. \nGraham, 383 U.S. at 14-15 (citations omitted). \nIt is clear that under this framework, a district court must consider in an \nobviousness inquiry the three primary factors identified by the Court in Graham: \n(1) the scope and content of the prior art, (2) the differences between the prior art \nand the claims at issue, and (3) the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. Less \nclear is the role, if any, secondary considerations should play in the analysis. \nThe logical-some would say necessary-implication of the Court's use of \nthe word \"secondary\" in Graham and its holding that the secondary considerations \n\"might be utilized\" and \"may have relevancy\" is that a district court is permitted\u00ad\nbut not required in all cases-to examine such considerations in evaluating an \nobviousness-based invalidity challenge. The Court seemed to confirm as much in \nKSR, when it noted that \"Graham set forth a broad inquiry and invited courts, \n62 where appropriate, to look at any secondary considerations that would prove \ninstructive.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 415 (emphasis added). \nBut a district court ignores Graham's \"invitation\" to examine secondary \nconsiderations at its peril. One legal scholar, Harmon, has observed that under \nFederal Circuit law \"[w]e are able now safely to strike the 'may' in the ... \nsentence\" in Graham in which the Court stated that secondary \"indicia of \nobviousness and nonobviousness ... may have relevancy.\" Robert Harmon, \nCynthia Homan, Laura Lydigsen, Patents and the Federal Circuit 245 (13th ed. \n2017). Harmon correctly notes that \"[t]he Federal Circuit has emphatically and \nrepeatedly held that objective evidence of non-obviousness must be taken into \naccount always and not just when the decisionmaker is in doubt.\" Id. In \nStratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1983), for example, the \nFederal Circuit held that \"evidence rising out of the so-called 'secondary \nconsiderations' must always when present be considered en route to a \ndetermination of obviousness.\" Id. at 1538. And in In re Cyclobenzaprine \nHydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent Litigation, 676 F.3d 1063 (Fed. \nCir. 2012), the Federal Circuit reaffirmed that holding, id. at 1079, and went on to \nsay that the Supreme Court in Graham \"did not relegate ... to 'secondary status\"' \nthe \"objective factors\" the Supreme Court had explicitly identified in Graham as \n\"secondary considerations.\" Id. at 1078. \n63 True, less than a month after In re Cyclobenzaprine, a different Federal \nCircuit panel held in Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. v. Sandoz, Inc., 678 F.3d 1280 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012) that because it found that the defendants had \"failed to prove that \n[the challenged patent claim] would have beenprimafacie obvious over the \nasserted prior art,\" it \"need not address\" the \"objective evidence\" of commercial \nsuccess, long felt need, and the failure of others. Id. at 1296. But the safer course \nfor a district court faced with an obviousness challenge is to treat Graham's \ninvitation to look at secondary considerations like a subpoena. \nObviousness is assessed based on the perspective of an artisan of ordinary \nskill at the time of the invention. Unigene Labs., Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 655 F.3d \n1352, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The court therefore needs to guard against \"hindsight \nbias\" that infers from the inventor's success in making the patented invention that \nthe invention was obvious. In re Cyclobenzaprine, 676 F.3d at 1079. The ultimate \nquestion in the obviousness analysis is \"whether there was an apparent reason [for \nan artisan of ordinary skill] to combine [at the time of the invention] the known \nelements in the fashion claimed by the patent at issue.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 418. \n\"The analysis is objective.\" Id. at 406. Thus, a court must determine whether an \nartisan of ordinary skill \"would have had reason to combine the teaching of the \nprior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and ... would have had a \n64 reasonable expectation of success [in] doing so.\" In re Cyclobenzaprine, 676 F.3d \nat 1069. \nThe party challenging the patent's validity bears the burden of proving \nobviousness by clear and convincing evidence. Id. at 1068-69. In weighing the \nGraham factors to decide whether the party has met that burden, the district court \nmust be guided by common sense. Wyers v. Master Lock Co., 616 F.3d 1231, \n1238 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Indeed, \"the legal determination of obviousness may \ninclude recourse to logic, judgment, and common sense, in lieu of expert \ntestimony.\" Id. at 1239. In KSR, the Supreme Court warned lower courts to avoid \n\"[r]igid preventative rules that deny factfinders common sense\" and to employ \ninstead \"an expansive and flexible approach\" under the Graham framework. KSR, \n550 U.S. at 415, 421. Thus, the district court may \"reorder[] in any particular \ncase\" the \"sequence\" in which it considers the Graham factors. Id. at 407. And \nalthough a court should consider carefully the published prior art, \"[t]he \nobviousness analysis cannot be confined by ... overemphasis on the importance \nof published articles and the explicit content of issued patents.\" Id. at 419. \n\"[A]ny need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of the \ninvention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the \nelements in the manner claimed.\" Id. at 420. And \"[t]he combination of familiar \nelements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more \n65 than yield predictable results.\" Id. at 416. \"[T]he fact that a combination was \nobvious to try might show that it was obvious under\u00a7 103.\" Id. at 421. But a \ncombination is obvious to try only \"[w]hen there is a design need or market \npressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable \nsolutions\" in the prior art at the time of the invention. Id. And the court must also \nbe mindful that \"when the prior art teaches away from combining certain known \nelements, discovery of a successful means of combining them is more likely to be \nnonobvious.\" Id. at 416. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. Claim 3 of the RE604 Patent \n1. Infringement \nVanda contends that Defendants' ANDA products will induce infringement \nof claim 3 of the RE604 patent. Defendants dispute only that they infringe claim \n3 's \"entraining\" and \"daily sleep period of approximately 7 to 9 hours\" limitations. \nI have already found as a factual matter that Vanda did not prove by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Defendants' ANDA labels instruct, \nrecommend, encourage, teach, or promote the use of Defendants' tasimelteon drug \nproducts to treat Non-24 by entraining a patient to a 24-hours sleep-wake \ncycle. Accordingly, Vanda has failed to establish that Defendants' ANDAs will \ninduce the infringement of claim 3 of the RE604 patent. See Limelight Networks, \nInc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc., 572 U.S. 915 (2014) (holding that a method \n66 patent \"is not infringed unless all the steps are carried out\" and that \"inducement \nliability may arise if, but only if, there is direct infringement\") ( cleaned up). I \ntherefore need not and do not address whether Defendants' ANDA products would \ninduce infringement of the \"daily sleep period\" limitation. \n2. Invalidity \nI also agree with Defendants that they have proved by clear and convincing \nevidence that claim 3 is invalid for obviousness. As I found above as a factual \nmatter, each element of the claimed method was taught or suggested by two \ndifferent combinations of prior art references and an artisan of ordinary skill would \nhave been motivated to combine the teachings and suggestions of those references \nto entrain a blind Non-24 patient with the claimed method and would have had a \nreasonable expectation of success in doing so. Accordingly, I conclude as a matter \nof law that claim 3 of the RE604 patent is invalid for obviousness. \nB. Claim 14 of the #829 Patent \nI agree with Defendants that they have proved by clear and convincing \nevidence that claim 14 of the #829 patent is invalid for obviousness in light of the \ncombinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, the #244 Publication, and Hardeland and (2) \nHack, the #244 Publication, and Hardeland. As I found above as a factual matter, \nboth of these combinations teach the treatment of patients with 20 milligrams of \ntasimelteon once daily, that tasimelteon is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, and \n67 that tasimelteon should not be co-administered with any drug that inhibits \nCYP1A2. An artisan of ordinary skill who intended to administer tasimelteon to a \npatient who was already taking a CYP1A2 inhibitor would have expected that \ntasimelteon should not be co-administered with a CYP1A2 inhibitor and would \nhave heeded Hardeland's warning against co-administering tasimelteon and \nCYP1A2 inhibitors, especially in light of the well-known drug-drug interaction \nbetween ramelteon and fluvoxamine. Thus, a skilled artisan would have found it \nobvious to discontinue treatment of a patient with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor such \nas fluvoxamine before treating that patient with tasimelteon. Accordingly, I \nconclude as a matter of law that claim 14 of the #829 patent is invalid for \nobviousness. \nHaving decided that claim 14 is invalid, I need not and do not address \nwhether Defendants' ANDA would infringe claim 14. See Prima Tek II, L.L.C. v. \nPolypap, S.A.R.L., 412 F.3d 1284, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (\"[T]here can be no ... \ninduced infringement of invalid patent claims.\") \nC. Claim 4 of the #910 Patent \nI agree with Defendants that they have proved by clear and convincing \nevidence that claim 4 of the #910 patent is invalid for obviousness in light of the \ncombinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, the #244 Publication, and Pandi-Perumal and \n(2) Hack, the #244 Publication, Hardeland, and Pandi-Perumal. As I found above \n68 as a factual matter, both of these combinations teach the treatment of light \nperception impaired (i.e., blind) Non-24 patients with 20 milligrams oftasimelteon \nonce daily before a target bedtime; that ramelteon is metabolized by CYP3A4 and \nshould not be used in combination with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin; that the \nCYP inducer rifampin has been shown to considerably decrease levels of both \nramelteon and its metabolite M-II; and that to avoid losses in efficacy, relevant \nCYP enzymes should be avoided when administering ramelteon. An artisan of \nordinary skill in January 2012 would have looked to ramelteon to predict \ntasimelteon's drug-drug interactions because of the many known similarities \nbetween ramelteon and tasimelteon, including the fact that ramelteon and \ntasimelteon have similar structures, half-life durations, and affinities for melatonin \nreceptors (MTl and MT2). And in light of Pandi-Perumal and the well-known \nsimilarities between ramelteon and tasimelteon, if, as of January 2012, a skilled \nartisan had intended to administer tasimelteon to a patient who was already taking \nthe CYP3A4 inducer rifampin, then the artisan would have expected that \ntasimelteon should not be co-administered with rifampin and would have thought it \nnecessary and obvious to stop treating the patient with rifampin before treating the \npatient with tasimelteon. Accordingly, I conclude as a matter of law that claim 4 \nof the #910 patent is invalid for obviousness. \n69 Having decided that claim 4 is invalid, I need not and do not address \nwhether Defendants' ANDA would infringe claim 4. See Prima Tek II, 412 F.3d at \n1291. \nD. Claim 5 of the #487 Patent \nI agree with Defendants that they have proved by clear and convincing \nevidence that claim 5 of the #487 patent is invalid as obvious in light of the \ncombinations of (1) Hack, Lankford, and the #244 Publication and (2) Hack, \nHardeland, and the #244 Publication. \nAs I found above as a factual matter, the combinations of (1) Hack, \nLankford, and the #244 Publication and (2) Hack, Hardeland, and the #244 \nPublication each teach the treatment of Non-24 patients with 20 milligrams of \ntasimelteon once daily 30 minutes before bedtime. I also found that it is more \nlikely than not that an artisan of ordinary skill who was administering tasimelteon \nwithin 30 minutes of the patient's bedtime would do so without food. And I found \nthat it therefore would have been obvious to an artisan of ordinary skill to \nadminister tasimelteon without food 30 minutes before bedtime. \nWhether to administer tasimelteon with food is a binary choice. A drug is \nadministered with or without food. \"When two equally viable options are \navailable, as here, then, without more, either one would seem to have been \nobvious.\" C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Medline Indus., Inc., 2021 WL 3574043, at *4 (Fed. \n70 Cir. Aug. 13, 2021); see also Gen. Elec. Co. v. Raytheon Techs. Corp., 983 F.3d \n1334, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \nAccordingly, I conclude as a matter of law that claim 5 of the #487 patent is \ninvalid for obviousness. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I find that Defendants' ANDA products do \nnot infringe claim 3 of the RE604 patent and that claim 3 of the RE604 patent, \nclaim 4 of the #829 patent, claim 14 of the #910 patent, and claim 5 of the #487 \npatent are invalid. \nThe Court will issue an Order directing the parties to submit a proposed \norder by which the Court may enter final judgments consistent with this Opinion. \n71 "}
