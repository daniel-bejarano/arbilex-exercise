The Court assumes familiarity with and incorporates by reference its March 2, \n2021 M emorandum Order  (the \u201cMarch MO\u201d)  in which it sets out the background facts and \nprocedural history leading up to the instant Motion.  (D.I. 368)  The  March MO  related to a \ndispute regarding Helena DuPont Wright\u2019s (\u201c Ms. Wright \u201d)1 inability to verify responses to \ncertain i nterrogatories that were propounded in August 2020 by Plaintiff T. Kimberly Williams  \n(\u201cMs. Williams\u201d) .  In the March MO, the Court, inter alia , ordered the parties to further meet \n \n1  Ms. Wright was an original Plaintiff in the action, (D.I. 1), but she has since \ndismissed her claims, (D.I. 374).  In the interim, counterclaims have been filed against Ms. \nWright, as to which she is a Third- party Defendant.  (D.I. 61)  2 \n and confer as to the need for a briefing schedule and a hearing with regard to a decision on Ms. \nWright\u2019s competency and her capacity to be sued pursuant to Rule 17.  ( Id. at 3)   As a result, the \nMotion was filed on April  30, 2021.  (D.I. 375)  Ms. Williams filed a response in opposition on \nMay 14, 2021.  (D.I. 380)    2. Ms. Wright contends that as a result of her cognitive decline over the past several \nyears, she is unable to verify interrogatory responses and continue a s a party in this action.  (D.I. \n375 at \u00b6 2 )  Accordingly, she requests that the Court  determine  that she  is legally incompetent \nand:  (1) find that Lucy Dunne  (\u201cMs. Dunne\u201d) , Ms. Wright\u2019s daughter, is the \u201creal party in \ninterest\u201d and permit  Ms. Dunne to de fend this action for Ms . Wright pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Proce dure 17(a)(1); (2) permit Ms. Dunne to continue in the case as a \u201clike fiduciary\u201d for \nMs. Wright , pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(1); and/or (3) substitute Ms. \nDunne a s a party in this action for Ms. Wright pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(b).  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 10 -13)   \n 3. The C ourt need only address Ms. Wright\u2019s  second and third r equests .\n2   \n \n2  With res pect to Ms. Wright\u2019s first request, the  Court is not persuaded that Rule \n17(a) would apply to these circumstances.  ( See Tr. at 54)  The Rule instructs that \u201c[a]n action \nmust be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest\u201d and sets out a list  of parties who \n\u201cmay sue in their own names without joining the person for whose benefit the action is \nbrought [.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(1); see also, e.g. , Va. Elec.  & Power  Co. v.  Westinghouse  Elec.  \nCorp., 485 F.2d 78, 83 (4th Cir. 1973)  (\u201cThe meaning a nd object of the real party in interest \nprinciple embodied in Rule 17[a]  is that the action must be brought by a person who possesses \nthe right to enforce the cl aim and who has a significant interest in the litigation .\u201d).  Thus, the \nplain language of  the R ule indicates that it is meant to be applied to those individuals who are \ninitiating a lawsuit \u2014not to those who are defendants in such a suit .  See Sloan v.  Overton , No. \n08-2571- JAR-DJW, 2010 WL 398108, at *6 n.56 (D. Kan. Jan. 25, 2010)  (\u201cRule  17(a) \nappli es to joinder of a plaintiff who is the \u2018real party in interest\u2019; it does not apply to joinder \nof defendants .\u201d).  This is further underscored when Rule 17(a)\u2019s language is compared to the \nlanguage of Rule 17(b), which is about how to determine one\u2019s capaci ty \u201cto sue or be sued\u201d  \n(and, by using such language, clearly indicates that it impacts both plaintiffs and defenda nts).  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 17(b)  (emphasis added) .  Moreover, the purpose of Rule  17(a) \u2014to \u201cprotect the \ndefendant from duplicative suits\u201d \u2014\u201csuggest s that the rule is not concerned with whether a 3 \n 4. With respect to Ms. Wright\u2019s second r equest , Rule 17(c)  sets out t he types of \nrepresentatives who \u201cmay sue or defend on behalf of . . . an incompetent person[,]\u201d including \u201ca \nlike fiduciary.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(1).  O n May 20, 2020, Ms. Wright appointed Ms. Dunne as \nher agent pursuant to a valid Maryland Statut ory Form Per sonal Financial Power of Attorney \n(\u201cStatutory Form\u201d) ; pursuant to the Statutory Form, Ms. Dunne is , inter alia , granted the power \nto defend and settle a lawsuit on Ms. Wright\u2019s behalf .  (D.I. 376, ex. I )3  And pursuant to \nMaryland law, the execution of a power of attorney is one way to create a fiduciary relationship.  See, e.g. , McElwee v. Williams , No. 1194, 2020 WL 6748799, at *3 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Nov. \n17, 2020).  It therefore is undisputed that Ms. Dunne, in light of the executed Statutory  Form,  \nwould qualify a s a \u201clike fiduciary\u201d under Rule 17(c)(1).  (D.I. 375 at \u00b6  12; Tr. at 56- 57) \n5. What is in dispute with respect to Rule 17(c) is whether Ms. Wright is \u201can \nincompetent person\u201d  for purposes of the Rule.  ( D.I. 380 at \u00b6\u00b6 11- 16; Tr. at 56- 57)  Rule 17(c) \ndoes not provide a standard for a court\u2019s determination of incompetency.  Richards v. Duke Univ. , 166 F. App\u2019x 595, 598 (3d Cir. 2006); Lopez v. CSX Transp., Inc., Case No. 3:14- cv-257, \n2020 WL 6151582, at *16 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 20, 2020).  Rul e 17(b), however, provides that the \ncapacity of a party to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the party\u2019s domicile.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 17(b); see also Richards , 166 F. App\u2019x at 598.  Thus, whether Ms. Wright is \nincompetent pursuant to Rule 17(c ) is d etermined by applying the law of t he State of Maryland, \n \ndefendant is the real party in interest.\u201d  Eaton Corp. v.  Westport  Ins. Co., 332 F.R.D. 585, 587 \n(E.D. Wis. 2019) .  Here, the action is already well underway, and Ms. Dunne is attempting to \nstand in for  a par ty wh o is a Third- party Defendant and is being sued in the action.  Thus, Rule \n17(a) would not seem to provide a solution.   \n \n3  The Statutory Form expressly states that the powers granted to the agent \u201care \nbroad and sweeping.\u201d  (D.I. 376, ex. I  at 1)  It provi des that, inter alia , the agent may \u201cparticipate \nin . . . settle, oppose, or propose or accept a compromise with respect to a claim existing in favor \nof or against the principal or intervene in litigation relating to the claim[.]\u201d  ( Id. at 3; see also  id. \nat 4-5) 4 \n which is Ms. Wright\u2019s domicile .  (D.I. 35 at \u00b6 22; Tr. at 56); see also Richards , 166 F. App\u2019x at \n598; Lopez , 2020 WL 6151582, at *16.  The burden of proof with respect to incompetency rests \nwith the party asserting it  (here, Ms. Wright) .  See, e.g., Chapman v. Ring\u2019s End, Inc., No. 3:17-\ncv-01084 (VAB), 2020 WL 3430350, at *5 (D. Conn. June 23, 2020); Scannavino v. Fl. Dep\u2019t of \nCorr ., 242 F.R.D. 662, 664 (M.D. Fl. 2007).  \n6. Maryland courts have descri bed mentally incompetent individuals as \u201cthose who \nlack the mental capacity to comprehend and safeguard their legal rights .\u201d  Kratz v. MedSource \nCmty. Servs., Inc., 139 A.3d 1087, 1092 ( Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2016) .  It is \u201cthe inability of the \nperson, by reas on of the incompetence, to understand that [] she has [or is subject to] a cause of \naction and to take the necessary steps [with regard to that action] that is the concern.\u201d  Id . \n(internal quotation marks and citations  omitted) ; see also Bean v. Dep\u2019 t of H ealth & Mental \nHygiene, 959 A.2d 778, 789 (Md. 2008) (the standard for determining whether a person is \ncompetent to stand trial is \u201cwhether the accused is able to understand the n ature of the \nproceedings against him and to assist in his own defense\u201d) ; Buxt on v. Buxton, 770 A.2d 152, 160 \n(Md. 2001) (explaining that a person is mentally incompetent if she is \u201cunable  . . . to manage [] \nher own business affairs or  comprehend [] her leg al rights and liabilities\u201d) .   \n 7. In alleging that she is an \u201cincompet ent pe rson\u201d for purposes of Rule 17(c) , Ms. \nWright points to the following pieces of evidence :  \n\u2022 The April 29, 2021 Affidavit of Dr. Jose Ma,  who has been Ms. \nWright\u2019s primary care physician since 1996, (D.I. 376, ex. P) , \nand Dr. Ma\u2019s testimony at the Mot ion he aring .  In the \nAffidavit, Dr. Ma recounted that during an October 2020 office \nvisit, Ms. Wright\u2019s dementia diagnosis was reconfirmed; \nduring that visit, Ms. Wright was disorien ted regarding place \nand time and could not identify the season or who was the \nPresident  of the United States .  (Id. at \u00b6 4)  Based on Dr. Ma\u2019s \nreview of documents from this litigation  (including the \noperative complaint) , as well as his knowledge of Ms. Wright\u2019s 5 \n medical history, Dr. Ma opined in the Affidavit that Ms. \nWright is :  (1) unable to recall key facts  related to this action; \n(2) unable to \u201ccomprehend, analyze , or direct the legal \nproceedings[;]\u201d; and (3) \u201ctherefo re \u201ccannot be expected to \nmeaningfully participate in the lawsuit[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 6 ; see also \nid. at \u00b6 5 )  Durin g the Motion hearing, Dr. Ma also testified \nthat Ms. Wright was first diagnosed with dementia in 2016; he \nexplained that w hile she may be able to answer very basic \nquestions (like \u201c[H]ow is your dog[?]\u201d), or make very basic \ndecisions about her daily functi on (li ke whether she wants to \ngo outside), she \u201c struggles \u201d to answer questions regarding \nmore complicated topics such as  those relating to current \nevents and news .  (Tr. at 8- 9, 12- 13, 17- 18)4 \n \n\u2022  The transcript of M s. Wright\u2019s February 2018 deposition taken \nin this lawsuit.  That transcript  demonstrates that Ms. Wright  \ncould not answer many  basic questions regarding the suit  (such \nas what she hoped to gain from it)  or the facts relating to the \nsuit (such as what the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or \u201c ERISA ,\u201d is).  (D.I. 375 at \u00b6 8; see also  D.I. \n376, ex. G )  Indeed, during that deposition, Ms. Wright had \ndifficulty in providing cogent answers to almost any question asked of her.  (D.I. 376, ex. G)  \n \n\u2022 Ms. Dunne \u2019s testimony  at the Motion hea ring and her \nAffidavit .  Ms. Dunne explained that she does not believe that \nMs. Wright is capable of understanding legal documents , nor \nof understanding the matters in dispute in this ERISA case .  \n(Tr. at 31, 35- 36)  Ms. Dunne also submitted an Affidavit d ated \nApril 30, 2021, in which she stated that Ms. Wright \u201cis unable \nto recall specific facts of the case, does not remember her employees\u2019 names,  and can only state that she is generally \naware of the existence of a lawsuit involving her grandmother\u2019s trust .\u201d  (D .I. 376, ex. O  at \u00b6 12)  \n \n \n4  In the March MO, the Court noted that the only piece of record evidence before it \nas to Ms. Wright\u2019s physical or mental condition was a physician\u2019s certificate that Dr. Ma signed \nin November 2020.  (D.I. 368 at 2- 3)  The Court explained tha t this certificate provided only \n\u201cminimal\u201d information regarding Ms. Wright\u2019s condition.  ( Id.)  However, the record is much \ndifferent now.  The Court now has the benefit of Dr. Ma\u2019s subsequent Affidavit, which is clearer \nabout Ms. Wright\u2019s limi tations.  A nd the Court has now also had the opportunity to hear Dr. \nMa\u2019s testimony on this subject, which was consistent with the content of his Affidavit.     6 \n  8. The Court concludes that Ms. W right has made a sufficient showing that she is \nincompetent  pursuant to Rule 17(c ).  The evidence  of record demonstrates that Ms. Wright does \nnot understand even the basic facts  of the lawsui t, and  therefore that she could not be expected to \ncomprehend and safeguard her legal rights and liabilities  with respect to th e suit .5  Cf. Lee v.  \nRetail Store  Emp.  Bldg. Corp., Case No. 15- cv-04768- LHK, 2017 WL 565710, at *3 (N.D. Cal. \nFeb. 13, 2017)  (finding the evidence sufficient to establish that the plaintiff was incompetent for \npurposes of Rule 17, where she had dementia and other mental health issues , and a physician had \nopined that the plaintiff \u201cdoes not have the capacity to manage her financial affair s[,] . . . needs \nassistance in managing her daily activities and her health and safety matters[, ] . . . [and] cannot \nenter into any legally binding decisions on her own\u201d ) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted); O \u2019Brien  v. Kline , Civil No. 12- cv-443-JD, 2013 WL 1737193, at *1 (D.N.H. Apr. 22, \n2013)  (concluding that one of the defendants was i ncompetent for purposes of Rule 17, where \nher treating physician\u2019s affidavit supported that she was \u201c suffering from  dementia  which makes \nher unable to per form m any important physical and mental functions \u201d and was \u201cunable to make \nand communicate decisions about her personal and financial matters \u201d).   \n 9. Finally, the Court turns to Ms. Wright\u2019s third r equest \u2014that Ms. Dunne should be \nsubstituted as a party in this action for Ms. Wright pursuant to Rule 25(b) .  (D.I. 375 at \u00b6\u00b6  13, 21)   \n \n5  Ms. Williams questions how it is that Ms. Wright could not answer basic \nquestions  about this  litigation  in her February 2018 deposition, but  yet still have the capacity to \nsubsequently, inter alia , execute the Statutory Form in May 2020.  (D.I. 380 at \u00b6 15; Tr. at 58)  \nThis is an understandable question, in light of how severely compromised Ms. W right\u2019s metal \nabilities appear to have been at the time of that deposition (and how compromised they appear to \nbe as of today).  Perhaps there is a good answer to the question, ( see Tr. at 47 -49), or perhaps \nnot, ( id. at 55, 58).  But at present, the key point is tha t Ms.  Williams is not challenging the \nvalidity of the Statutory Form.  ( See id. at 55)   Thus, the Court must assume, for purposes of \nresolving the Motion, that the Statutory Form is valid.  And otherwise, the evidence before the \nCourt is very clear th at Ms . Wri ght cannot now effectively safeguard her legal rights in this \nmatter.  7 \n That Rule sta tes that \u201c[i]f a party becomes incompetent, the court may, on motion, permit the \naction to be continued by or against the party\u2019s representative.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(b) ; see also \nSloan v.  Overton , No. 08 -2571- JAR-DJW, 2010 WL 398108, at *6 n.56 (D. Kan. Jan. 25, 2010)  \n(\u201cGenerally, Rule 17 governs a person\u2019 s capacity to  initiate  suit and Rule 25 governs cases in \nwhich substitution becomes necessary while the case is  pending before the court.\u201d) (emphasis in \noriginal).  The decisio n to allow the substitution of parties during pending litigation is within the \ncourt \u2019s discretion.  Bah  v. Wash . Metro.  Area  Transit  Auth., Civil Action No. : CBD -14-2803, \n2015 WL 6460082, at *2  (D. M d. Oct. 23, 2015) .   \n10. Ms. Wright\u2019s Motion made reference to Rule 25(b), and the Motion was served \non the parties.  (D.I. 375 at 14- 16; see also Tr. at 59 (Ms. Williams\u2019 counsel noting that there \nwould be \u201cvalue\u201d in formally substituting Ms. Dunne as Ms.  Wright\u2019s representative here, \npursuant to Rule 25(b))   The Court thus con strues  the Motion to be one  brought pursuant to Rule \n25(b)  (as well as Rule 17 ) (the \u201cRule 25(b) Motion\u201d) .  In light of the Cour t\u2019s conclusion above \nthat Ms. Wright is inc ompete nt, the Rule 25(b) Motion is GRANTED and Ms. Dunne is \npermitted to be substituted in her capacity as representative for Ms. W right in this action.  The \nClerk of the Court is DIRECTED to amend the case caption to reflect this substitution.  See \nRingdahl  v. Afsha rjavan, No. 8:18- CV-01006- PX, 2020 WL 2795358, at *3 (D. Md.

Furthermore, the STAY of the deadline for Ms. Wright to answer Ms . \nWilliams\u2019  interrogatories under oath is hereby LIFTED, and Ms. Dunne shall respond to those \ninterrogatories by August 30, 2021.
