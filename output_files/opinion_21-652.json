The Court, having reviewed Defendant  Tonal Systems, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \n\u201cTonal\u201d)  motion to dismiss Plaintiff  ICON Health & Fitness, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cICON\u201d) \nclaims for i nduced and willful i nfringement , filed p ursuant to Fed eral Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6)  (the \u201cMotion\u201d) , (D.I. 10), the briefing related thereto, (D.I. 11; D.I. 14; D.I. 15; D.I.  17), \nand having considered the relevant legal standard, see, e.g. , Tonal Sys., Inc. v. ICON Health & \nFitness, Inc., Civil Action No. 20- 1197- LPS, 2021 WL 1785072, at *2 (D. Del. May 5, 2021) , \nrecommends that the Motion be GRANTED- IN-PART a nd DENIED -IN-PART  for the reasons \nthat follow . \n2. ICON asserts two patents in this case, United States Patent Nos. 10,953,268 and \n10,967,214 (the \u201c '268 and '214 patents\u201d) ; these patents  issued on March 23, 2021 and April 6, \n2021, respectively .  (D.I. 7 at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 34)  ICON \u2019s original C omplaint, filed on May 5, 2021, \nasserted only direct infringement claims.  (D.I. 1)  ICON  then filed the operative First Amended \nComplaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) on May 24, 2021, adding allegations of induced and willful infringement of \nthe '268 and '214 patents.  (D.I. 7 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30, 37, 43)1  With respect to these claims, t he FAC \n \n1  Tonal does not challenge the direct infringement claims  with the instant Motion .   2 \n alleges that Tonal had notice of the '268 and '214 patents  \u201csince at least the date the present \naction was filed\u201d and that it has continued to knowingly engage in infringing conduct  thereafter .  \n(Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 27 -28, 40- 41) \n3. With  its Motion, Tonal argues that ICON \u2019s FAC fails to sufficiently allege that \nTonal had prior knowledge of the '268 and '214 patents , such that the  claims -at-issue must be \ndismissed .  (D.I. 11 at 2- 6)2   \n4. ICON  responds by asserting th at the FAC plausibly alleges the knowledge -of-the \npatents  element .  It argues this is so because the FAC\u2019s  allegations, viewed in context along with \nthe facts regarding a related patent infringement case involving the se parties, Tonal Sys., Inc. v. \niFit Inc. , Civil Action No. 20- 1197- LPS-CJB (D. Del.) (the \u201c20- 1197 case\u201d) , render  it plausible \nthat Tonal knew of the '268 and '214 patents as of \u201cthe very day that each [patent] issued\u201d or \n\u201cwithin days of their issuance[.]\u201d  (D.I. 14 at 2, 7)   The contextual facts and reasonable \ninferences that ICON points to in support of this conclusion include the following:     \n\u2022 The '268 and '214 patents asserted here are related by \ncontinuation to the patents at issue in the 20- 1197 case, \nUnited States Patent Nos. 10,709,925 and 10,758,767 (the \u201c'925 and '767 patents\u201d); the 20- 1197 case  is a decl aratory \njudgment action brought by Tonal .;  \n \u2022 In the 20 -1197 case, Tonal alleges non -infringement of the \n'925 patent because the accused product lacks the required \u201ctower\u201d and \u201cmagnetic mechanism\u201d elements required by that patent, and it alleges non- infringement of the ' 767 \n \n2  A party asserting a claim of  induced infringement  must plead facts plausibly \ndemonstrating that there has been direct infringement, and that the alleged inducer knew of the \npatent, knowingly induced the infringing acts, and possessed a specific intent to encourage \nanother \u2019s infringement of the patent.  Tonal  Sys., Inc. , 2021 WL 1785072, at *3 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  And i n order to sufficiently plead willful infringement , a \npatentee must allege facts plausibly showing that as of the time of the claim \u2019s filing, the accused \ninfringer:  (1) knew of the patents -in-suit; (2) after acquiring that knowledge, it infringed the \npatents; and (3) in doing so, it knew, or should have known, that its conduct amounted to \ninfringement of the patent s.  Id.  at *6 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).    3 \n patent because the accused product lacks the required \n\u201ctower\u201d and \u201celectromagnetic unit\u201d elements.;  \n \u2022 With respect to the patents asserted in the instant action, the claims of the '268 patent omit the \u201ctower\u201d and \u201cmagnetic \nmechan ism\u201d elements , while the claims of the '214 patent \nomit the \u201ctower\u201d and \u201celectromagnetic unit\u201d elements  (but \nthe patents -in-suit here are otherwise similar to the patents \nasserted in the 20 -1197 case) .;  \n \n\u2022 Tonal \u2019s declaratory judgment complaint in the 20- 1197 \ncase demonstrates its awareness of ICON\u2019s involvement in \nover 50 lawsuits involving related or similar patents to the '925 and '767 patents.;   \n \u2022 The parties are competitors in the at -home fitness industry \nthat produce competing strength training products.; and  \n \u2022 It is reasonable to infer that Tonal has conducted extensive investigations with regard to ICON and its patent portfolio, \nthat Tonal was \u201cclosely watching the ongoing prosecution of patent applications related to the patents asserted in the 1197 case\u201d and that Tonal thus  learned of the '268 and '214 \npatents on or near the da tes that they issued.   \n (Id. at 2 -12) \n \n 5. The problem with ICON \u2019s argument is that  many of th e facts associated with the \nabove  assertions  are not actually pleaded in the FAC .  (See D.I. 15 at 1)  A nd beyond that, the \nFAC surely makes no attempt to muster  the above -referenced facts together  and assert or allege  \nin some understandable way  that Tonal knew of the patents -in-suit as of (or very close to) the \ndates  that those patents issued.  ( See id. )  To do so, the FAC would need to use words that form \nsentences that  actually say  something like this.   It does not do that.  I nstead,  it alleges only t hat \nTonal knew of the patents as of \u201cthe date the present action was filed \u201d\u2014an allegation that, \ndespite ICON\u2019s argument to the contrary, (D.I. 14 at 9), can only be reasonably understood in \ncontext to mean that Tonal learned of the patents as a resul t of receiving the original Complaint \nitself.  A nd a plaintiff  is not permitted to amend its complaint by way of arguments set out in 4 \n a brief  opposing a motion to dismiss.  See,  e.g., CareDx,  Inc. v. Natera, Inc. , Civil Action No. \n19-662-CFC -CJB, 2019 WL 7037799, at *12 (D. Del. Dec. 20, 2019), report  and \nrecommendation adopted, 2020 WL 401773 (D. Del. Jan. 24, 2020) ; Mason  v. Delaware , Civ. \nNo. 15- 1191- LPS, 2017 WL 4070741, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 14, 2017).  S o as the FAC currently \nstands, it fails to plausibly state \u201c pre-suit\u201d induced infringement and willful infringement  claims \n(meaning, claims that were triggered or that have effect prior to the date of the filing of the \noriginal Complaint in this case) .  Thus, the Court recommends  that the Motion be GRANTED to \nthe extent it seeks dismissal of these claims in that regard.    \n 6. In its briefing, ICON requests leave to amend should the Court grant the Motion.  \n(D.I. 14 at 7, 13)  Leave to amend should be given freely \u201cwhen justice so requires[,]\u201d Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 15(a)(2), particularly where, as here, this is the first time that a c ourt has found ICON\u2019s \nallegations wanting  in any respect.  So if ICON wants to try to plead induced and willful \ninfringement claims that take effect as of March 23, 2021 and April 6, 2021 (or shortly \nthereafter) , respectively, then t he Court recommends that it b e given leave to file a further \namended complaint seeking to do so.3     \n \n3  Tonal argues tha t even if ICON\u2019s FAC had included the factual allegations that it \nnow point s to in its responsive brief, such allegations would still fail to plausibly plead pre -\noriginal -Complaint  knowledge.  (D.I. 15 at 2- 3)  According to Tonal, allegations describing a \nparty\u2019s knowledge of  an adversary\u2019s  related patent s, combined with conclusory allegations that \nthe party monitored its adversary\u2019s patent applications and/or was a competitor in the field , fail \nto establish that a party had knowledge of its adversary\u2019s later -issued patent.  ( Id. at 3)  However, \nit seems that ICON\u2019s unple aded allegations ( and the reasonable inferences to be drawn \ntherefrom ), taken together, could amount to more than this .  They  might be enough to pla usibly \nestablish pre -original -Complaint knowledge of the '268 and '214 patents.  See, e.g., Midwest \nEnergy Emissions Corp. v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Civil Action No. 19- 1334- RGA- CJB, \n2021 WL 2036671, at *10 (D. Del. May 20, 2021) (finding that allegations that the defendants \nwould have reviewed the prosecution history with regard to patents previously asserted against \nthem , and  then have  been on the lookout for related patents that might issue thereafter , all \nrendered it plausible that the defendants had prior knowledge of new ly-issued patents  asserted \nagainst them in an amended complaint ), report and recommendation adopted in relevant part , 5 \n  7. But if ICON just wants to move forward with any  claim of induced or willful \ninfringement, in the Court\u2019s view, it should not have to re -plead.  That is because, even though it \ndid not plausibly allege knowledge of the patents -in-suit prior to  Tonal\u2019s  receipt  of the original \nComplaint , it did plausibly allege that Tonal had knowledge of the patents -in-suit a s of the date \nwhen the original Complaint was received  (i.e., on or around May 5, 2021).  The Court \nacknowledges that there is a disagreement in the federal courts (and in our Court) about whether \na plaintiff can sufficiently plead knowledge of a  patent -in-suit in an amended complaint by \nsimply pointing back to the notice that the accused infringer received of th e patent\u2019s existence \nvia the filing of a prior complaint in the same case .4  But as the Court  has previously explained in \n \n2021 WL 4350591 (D. Del. Sept. 24, 2021); InVue Sec. Prods. Inc v. Mobile Tech, Inc., Case \nNo. 3:19- cv-407-SI, 2019 WL 5295464, at *4- 5 (D. Or. Oct. 18, 2019) (finding that allegations \nthat the parties were involved in multiple lawsuits , were involved in ongoing post -grant \nproceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and were competitors in the \nsame industry, amounted to enough facts from which t o infer pre -suit knowledge at the motion to \ndismiss stage); Copan Italia S.p.A. v. Puritan Med. Prods. Co. LLC , 1:18 -cv-00218- JDL, 2018 \nWL 5891742, at *3 ( D. Me. Nov. 9, 2018) ( concluding that allegations that a defendant had \nreviewed all of the plaintiff\u2019s pending patent applications, and that it had publicly acknowledged \nthat the plaintiff owned several patents, together with the allegation that the parties we re \ncompetitors in a specialized market, \u201creasonably permit an inference that [defendant ] was \nkeeping up to date on the status of [plaintiff\u2019s] patent applications [,]\u201d and finding that the \ncomplaint thus plausibly pleaded knowledge of the patents -in-suit).   \n \n4  See, e.g., Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc., Civil Action No. 20- cv-1345- RGA, 2021 \nWL 4477022, at *6- 7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021) (recognizing disagreement as to whether an \namended complaint can cite to service of a prior complaint in order to establish the knowledge \nelement for post -suit induced infringement and willful infringement claims , and finding that it \ncan as to induced infringement but not as to willful infringement); Longhorn Vaccines & \nDiag nostics, LLC v. Spectrum Sols. LLC , \u2014 F. Supp. 3d \u2014, 2021 WL 4324508, at *9- 10 & \nnn.95, 96 ( D. Utah Sept. 23, 2021)  (recogn izing the split on this issue and finding that \nknowledge of patents gained from an original complaint is sufficient to establish post- filing \nindirect and willful infringement claims); Ravgen, Inc. v. Ariosa  Diagnostics, Inc. , C.A. No. 20-\n1646- RGA- JLH, 2021 WL 3526178, at *4 (D. Del. Aug. 11, 2021)  (acknowledging the split and \nconcluding that a party may maintain a claim for willful infringement made in an amended \ncomplaint if the accused infringer first gained knowledge of the patent from the original \ncomplaint); ZapFraud, Inc. v. Barracuda Networks, Inc ., 528 F. Supp. 3d 247, 249- 50 (D. Del. \n2021) (r ecognizing the division and concluding that a \u201ccomplaint itself cannot be the source of 6 \n a number of opinions , it believes that a plaintiff can do so.5  Thus, to the extent that ICON \nintends to pr ess \u201cpost-suit\u201d induced infringement and willful infringement claims, dating from on \n \nthe knowledge required to sustain claims of induced infringement and willfulness -based \nenhanced damages\u201d).   \n \n5  See, e.g., Midwest Energy Emissions Corp., 2021 WL 2036671, at *20, report and \nrecommendation adopted in relevant part , 2021 WL 4350591 (D. Del. Sept. 24, 2021) ; \nZapFraud, Inc. v. Barracuda Networks, Inc ., Civil Action No. 19- 1687- CFC- CJB, 2020 WL \n5646375, at *2- 3 (D. Del. Sept. 22, 2020) , report and recommendation rejected in relevant part , \n528 F. Supp. 3d 247 (D. Del. 2021) ; V\u00e4linge Innovation AB v. Halstead New Eng. Corp., Civil \nAction No. 16- 1082- LPS-CJB, 2018 WL 2411218, at *11 n.15 (D. Del. May 29, 2018). \n \nThe Court has two  other quick thoughts to offer about this issue.   \n \nFirst, because the act of receiving the original Complaint \u2014and relatedly, learning of the \nexistence of the patents -in-suit\u2014may  be \u201cevent[s] that happened after the date\u201d t hat th e original  \nComplaint was filed, then instead of simply filing the FAC, ICON perhaps should have filed a \nproposed new supplemental complaint along with a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 15(d).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d); s ee also Sunless, Inc. v. Selby Holdings, LLC , Case No. \n3:20- cv-00930, 2021 WL 3513871, at *2- 3 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 10, 2021).  But if that is so, the \nCourt would simply recommend treating the filling of the FAC as a de facto  Rule 15(d) motion \nand granting it, since (like with a Rule 15(a) motion), leave to supplement is to be freely given \n(in the absence of any compelling reason not  to do so) .  Sunless, Inc., 2021 WL 3513871, at *2 -\n3, *5- 6 (citing Ne. Ohio Coal . for the Homeless v. Husted , Case No. 2:06- CV-00896, 2015 WL \n13034990, at *6 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 7, 2015)) ; see also Cellectis S.A. v. Precision Biosciences, Inc. , \n881 F. Supp. 2d 609, 614 (D. Del. 2012).   \n \nSecond, the Court does not see why a n element of a claim like induced or willful \ninfringement ( i.e., the element that requires that an infringer have prior knowledge of the \nexistence of the  patent -in-suit) cannot be established in an amended complaint, where the \nevidence alleged is that the accused infringer received an initial complai nt in that  case and thus \nlearned of the patent that way.  That is, the Court does not see why an  original complaint, or  facts \nrelating to its receipt , must necessarily be walled off from being a relevant piece of fact evidence \nin a case.  S uppose a patentee filed an original complaint that gave the accused infringer notice \nof a patent for the first time .  Then, on the same date, the patentee sent the accused infringer a \nletter that also gave  it notice of that same patent.  And suppose later in the case, the patentee filed \nan amended complaint  (or, as noted above, a supplemental complaint along with a Rule 15(d) \nmotion) , alleging induced/willful infringement claims and ass erting that the accused infringer \nhad knowledge of the  patent as of  its receipt of the original complaint and/or as of the date of its \nreceipt of the notice letter.  Wouldn\u2019t receipt of the notice letter have been sufficient to provide \nthe accused infringer with knowledge of the patent\u2019s existence?  And if it would, what is the \ndifference between th e knowledge that the accused infringer received via th at letter a nd the \nknowledge  that it received fro m reviewing the original complaint?  In the Court\u2019s view, there is 7 \n or about May 5, 2021, the Court recommends that the Motion be DENIED with respect to such \nclaims.  ( See D.I. 11 at 7 (Tonal requesting that ICON\u2019s induced and willful infringement claims \n\u201cbe dismissed in their entirety\u201d))6 \n8. This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), \nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.  See Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987); Sincavage v. Barnhart , 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1 \n(3d Cir. 2006).

Burke    \n      UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDG E \n \nno meaningful difference.  Both are viable pieces of evidence that could plausibly establish the \nknowledge-of-the- patent  element.   \n \n6  The Court has previously explained why, pursuant to relevant caselaw from the \nSupreme Court of the United States and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \u201cto state a claim of willful infringement, the patentee must allege facts in its pleading  \nplausibly demonstrating that the accused infringer had committed subjective willful infringement \nas of the date of the filing of the willful infringement claim[.] \u201d  V\u00e4linge Innovation AB , 2018 WL \n2411218, at *12; se e also  (D.I. 11 at 4).   In the FAC, ICON is doing that\u2014it is alleging that as of \nthe \u201cdate of the filing of the willful infringement claim\u201d (i.e., as of the date of the FAC\u2019s filing), \nTonal had previously committed willful infringement (i.e., it had done so as of the date of the \nreceipt of the original Complaint and thereafter).  \n"}
