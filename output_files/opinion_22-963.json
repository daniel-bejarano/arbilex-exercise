Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nOctober 22, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nP\n\nhy\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:\n\nPlaintiff Evangelistic C.U. Godson commenced this action on July 22, 2022.\n(D.I. 2) He appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma\npauperis. (D.I. 6) Plaintiff has filed a number of motions. (D.I. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13)\nThe Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(b).\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d\nCir. 2008). On April 24, 2022, Plaintiff was attacked by a dog while riding his\nbike at Fox Point Park in Wilmington, Delaware. (D.I. 2 at 3; D.I. 2-1 at 1)\nPlaintiff called 911 and was referred to Animal Control. (D.I. 2 at 3) Plaintiff\nwaited for over an hour yet no police or anyone else came to assist him. (/d. at 5)\n\nPlaintiff also alleges that despite his repeated complaints, New Castle\nCounty allows his neighbor to violate a county noise ordinance when the neighbor\nuses a leaf blower early in the morning and the neighbor has dogs who bark early\nin the morning. (/d.) Plaintiff sought Freedom of Information Acts requests from\nDefendants New Castle County Public Safety, New Castle County Animal Control,\nand DNREC Delaware Department of Natural Resources. (/d.) Plaintiff contacted\n\nDELDOT to complain about the high volume of commercial vehicles that place\n1\nsigns at both entrances to Plaintiff's street. (/d.) The person to whom he\ncomplained stopped communicating with him. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that he \u201cfeels\nlike\u201d HUD knew of racial conflicts in his neighborhood when it sold Plaintiff\nproperty in 2012 and that property was encroached by Plaintiffs neighbor. (Jd. at\n6) Plaintiff received a suspicious package containing an animal product and\nbelieves it was sent by Animal Control. (/d. at 7) Plaintiff contacted Delaware\nHuman Relations on June 22, 2022 to assist with discriminatory practices and \u201cran\ninto a conflict of interest.\u201d! (Id.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges discrimination by reason of his race and age. (D.I. 2 at 3)\nHe seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the\nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v.\nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in\n\nforma pauperis actions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a\n\nAttached to the complaint is a Division of Human Relations Equal Accommodations Intake\nQuestionnaire dated June 22, 2022, where Plaintiff complained of discrimination based upon his\nrace and age by white police officers who took his complaint about the dog attack. (D.I. 2-1 at\n1-4)\n\n2\ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is\nliberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to\nless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.\nSee Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v.\nWilliams, 490 U.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it\ndepends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374\n(quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-\n28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling\non Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\n3\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of\nentitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\nThough \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241\n(3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a complaint must\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d\nCir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) and Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal theory\nsupporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nI. DISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs remedy does not lie in this Court. Delaware\u2019s Equal\n\nAccommodations Act, codified at Title 6, Chapter 45, of the Delaware Code \u201cis\n4\nintended to prevent, in places of public accommodations, practices of\ndiscrimination against any person because of race, age, marital status, creed, color,\nsex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.\u201d 6 Del. C. \u00a7\n4501. In Miller v. Spicer, 602 A.2d 65 (Del. 1991), the Delaware Supreme Court\nheld that the Equal Accommodations Act does not authorize a private cause of\naction and that the Act\u2019s administrative remedies are the exclusive means for\nredressing the discriminatory practices prohibited by the Act. Accordingly,\nPlaintiff's only course of redress for discriminatory practices prohibited by the Act\nis to file a complaint with the administrative agency authorized by the Act\u2014the\nHuman Relations Commission. Once the Commission has ruled on the matter, it\nmay be appealed to the Delaware Superior Court. See 6 Del. C. \u00a7 4511(a).\n\nTo the extent Plaintiff raises claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or against HUD,\na federal agency, the claims fail. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources\nand the Delaware Department of Transportation are immune from suit. See\nManuel v. Atkins, 545 F. App\u2019x 91, 95 (3d Cir. 2013) (Delaware DOT, as an\nagency of the State of Delaware has Eleventh Amendment immunity); Smith v.\nTown of Dewey Beach, 659 F. Supp. 752, 756 (D. Del. 1987) (Delaware\nDepartment of Natural Resources immune from suit under the Eleventh\nAmendment). Similarly the United States Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment is immune from suit. See Danihel v. Office of President of the\n5\nUnited States, 616 F. App\u2019x 467, 470 n.2 (3d Cir. 2015) (constitutional claims\nagainst HUD are barred by sovereign immunity.\n\nThe claims against New Castle County Public Safety and New Castle\nCounty Animal Control, in essence, are claims against New Castle County. They\ntoo, fail to state claims. Plaintiff fails to identify a relevant New Castle County\npolicy or custom that would render it liable. See Monell v. Department of Soc.\nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 690-92 (1978) (ruling that a local government can be liable\nunder \u00a7 1983 only when its policy or custom caused a constitutional violation).\nSee Williams v. Delaware Cnty. Bd. of Prison Inspectors, 844 F. App\u2019x 469, 475\n(3d Cir. 2021). The claims against the New Castle County Defendants are )\nfrivolous and will be dismissed.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot Plaintiff's motions\n(DI. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (iii). Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n"}
