West  (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) .  (D.I. 3; D.I. 16) .  The Honorable Gregory M. Sleet \ndismissed the Petition as time-barred on October 24, 2017.  (D.I. 68) .  Petition er filed a Rule 60(b ) \nmotion for reconsideration, which this Court  denied.  (D.I. 78) .  Petitioner appealed and the Third \nCircuit reversed and remanded the case for an additional determination on equitable tolling.  \n(D.I.  84).  On remand, the  State waived the statute of limitations defense and the Court granted \nPetitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and re -opened Petitioner\u2019s habeas proceeding.  (D.I. 88).  Petitioner \nfiled a Motion for Discovery and Reas sertion  of Petitioner\u2019s Pro Se  Motions, with several of \nPetitioner\u2019s earlier pro se  submissions attached.  (D.I. 89) .  The Court issued an Order directing \nPetitioner to file a clarifying Memorandum in Support indicating which grounds Petitioner wished \nto pursue.  (D.I. 90) .  Petitioner filed two  Memorand a in Support .  (D.I.  91; D.I. 97).  The State \nfiled an A nswer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed several Replies.  (D.I. 98; D.I. 102; \nD.I. 103; D.I. 104) . \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe charges at issue stem from three separate bank robberies and \none bank robbery attempt, all of which were committed within the span of less than a week.  Based on video surveillance and the \ndescription of the suspect from the witnesses to the bank robbe ries, \na photo array was generated.  Delaware State Police showed the \narray to three people, all of whom identified [Petitioner]  as the \nperpetrator of the robbery.  There was a witness from the Citizens Bank robbery who observed the suspect using a dark colored Jeep Wrangler that identified [Petitioner]  as the suspect.   In addition to being identified by the \nwitness as the bank robber, the vehicle identified as being driven by the bank robber, a dark colored Jeep Wrangler, matched the description of the vehicle [Petitioner]  drove.  In fact, [Petitioner]  \nadmitted to having committed the Citize n\u2019s Bank robbery and \nhaving driven a Jeep Wrangler to Citizen\u2019 s Bank when he \ncommitted the bank robbery.  2 [Petitioner]  was also identified as the bank robber by the assistant \nmanager at the Citizens Bank who was working at the time of the \nrobbery.  The teller from the PNC bank robbery also identified \n[Petitioner]  as the person who committed the PNC robbery.  \n [Petitioner\u2019s]  uncle also confirmed that the photo released from the \nCitizen \u2019s Bank robbery depicting the suspect was his nephew, \n[Petitioner] . \n [Petitioner] , when interviewed by the police, confessed to \ncommitting the three bank robberies and the attempted bank robbery.  \n \nState v. West , 2013 WL 6606833, at *1\u20132 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 12, 2013) .   \nIn August 2011, a New Castle County grand jury indicted Petitioner on two counts of first \ndegree robbery, second degree robbery, and attempted first degree robbery.  (D.I. 99- 1 at 1, Entry \nNo. 2; D.I. 98 at 3) .  On October 21, 2011, the Superior Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion for a \npsychiatric evaluation.  (D.I. 19- 1 at 2, Entry N os. 9, 10) .  The psychiatric report conclud ing that \nPetitioner was competent to enter a plea was provided to the Superior Court on December 1, 2011.  \n(D.I. 19- 1 at 2, Entry No. 11) .  On January 9, 2012, Petitioner  pled guilty to one count each of first \nand second degree robbery.  See West v. State , 100 A.3d 1022 (Table), 2014 WL 4264922, at *1 \n(Del. Aug. 28, 2014).  On March 30, 2012, the Superior Court sentenced Petiti oner as a hab itual \noffender to a total of twenty- eight years at Level V incarceration, to be suspended after serving \ntwenty -five years in prison for decreasing levels of supervision.  Petitioner  did not file a direct \nappeal.  Id .  \nOn February 27, 2013, Petitioner  filed a pro se  motion for post -conviction relief pursuant \nto Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion) .  (D.I. 19- 1 at 4, Entry No. 39) .  \nThe Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner.  See West , 2013 WL 6606833, at *2.  \nIn November 2013, after determining that there were no meritorious issues to pursue, post -\nconviction counsel filed a motion to withdraw  along with a memorandum of law in support thereof .  3 Id.  The memorandum  included the two arguments Petitioner still wished to pursue.  Id. at *2 -3.  \nOn December 12, 2013, a  Superior Court Commissioner issued a Report and Recommendation \nconcluding that the Rule 61 motion should be denied and post -conviction counsel\u2019s motion to \nwithdraw should be granted.  See id . at *7.  On January 7, 2014, t he Superior Court adopted the \nReport and Recommendation, denied the Rule 61 motion, and granted post -conviction counsel\u2019s \nmotion to withdraw .  See West v. State, 147 A.3d 234 (Table), 2016 WL 4547912, at *1 (Del. Aug. \n31, 2016).  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on August 28, 2014.  See  West v. \nState , 100 A.3d 1022 (Table), 2014 WL 4264922 (Del. Aug. 28, 2014).     \nOn February 24, 2015, Petitioner  filed in the Delaware Superior Court a second Rule 61 \nmotion and a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  See State v. West , 2015 WL 3429919, at *1- 2 \n(Del. Super. Ct. May 21, 2015).  The Superior Court denied both motions on May 21, 2015.  Id .  \nPetitioner did not appeal that decision.  \nPetitioner filed a third  Rule 61 motion on March 21, 2016.  See West , 2016 WL 4547912, \nat *1.  On May 16, 2016, the Superior Court summarily dismissed Petitioner\u2019s th ird Rule 61 motion \nas procedurally barred under Rule 61(d)(2).  See id .  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that \ndecision on August 31 2016.  See id . at *2.  \nIn April and May of 2016, Petitioner  filed a Rule 35(a) motion and an amended Rule 35(a) \nmotion f or correction of sentence.  See West  v. State , 148 A.3d 687 (Table), 2016 WL 5349354, at \n*1 (Del. Sept. 23, 2015) .  The Superior Court denied the motions and the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed that decision on September 23, 2016.  See id.  at *2. \nIn the meantime, in  December 2014, Petitioner  filed in this Court a pro se  federal  habeas \npetition, followed by an amended petition and memorandum of points (hereinafter collectively \nreferred to as \u201cPetition  I\u201d), asserting the following five grounds for relief: (1) his habitual offender \nsentence is illegal because one of the predicate convictions is illegal; (2) his guilty plea was 4 unknowing and involuntary; (3) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance; (4) his confession \nwas coerced; (5) the conditions of his confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment; and \n(6) he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  (D.I. 3; D.I. 9) .  The State filed an \nanswer asserting that Petition I  should be denied as time -barred or, alternatively, because the \nclaims lack ed merit.  (D.I. 21) .  The Honorable Gregory M. Sleet denied P etition I as time -barred  \nin October 2017.  (D.I. 67; D.I. 68) .  In September 2018, Petitioner filed a motion for \nreconsideration .  (D.I. 69) .  The case was re- assigned to this Court, and  the Court ordered the State \nto respond.  (D.I. 73) .  The Court denied the motion for reconsideration.  (D.I. 78) .  Petitioner \nappealed and the Third Circuit vacated the dismissal of the reconsideration motion and remanded the case for this Court to \u201cdetermine whether [Petitioner] attempted to filed a (timely)  habeas \npetition in June 2014 such that equitable tolling might be appropriate.\u201d  (D.I. 84) .  In February \n2021, the State informed the Court that they could neither prove nor disprove whether Petitioner attempted to file a timely habeas petition and waived  their statute of limitations defense.  (D.I. 86) .  \nIn March 2021, the Court vacated the dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s habeas P etition and ordered the case \nreopened.  (D.I. 88) .  Upon Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s request (D.I. 87), t he Court issued an Order \nproviding Petitioner\u2019s counsel with an opportunity to \u201cassess whether to re -assert  and/or refile\u201d \nPetitioner\u2019s previous pro se  motions and/or filings (D.I. 88) . \nPetitioner \u2019s counsel  filed a Motion for Discovery and Re -Assertion of Petitioner\u2019s Pro Se  \nMotions.  (D.I. 89) .  The filing by Petitioner\u2019s counsel consisted of four pro se submissions by \nPetitioner .\n1  Unclear as to Petitioner\u2019s intent in attaching the previously denied filings  without any \n \n1  Three of the submissions were motions (D.I. 89 -2; D.I. 89- 3; D.I. 89- 4) that had been \npreviously denied by Judge Sleet.  The other re -submitted filing was a document titled \n\u201cAmended Petition.\u201d  (D.I. 89 -1).  As that \u201cAmended Petition\u201d was filed after the S tate had \nalready filed its Answer to the original petition ( see D.I. 33), Judge Sleet ruled that  the \nCourt would not consider any new claims contained in the \u201cAmended Petition\u201d that did not \n\u201crelate back\u201d to the claims in the petition(s) filed prior to the State\u2019s Answer.  (D .I. 50) . 5 briefing ,2 the Court issued an Order : (1) rejecting Petitioner\u2019s Motion to the extent he was \nattempting to have the previously rejected submissions /claims  included in the proceeding; \n(2) gra nting Petitioner\u2019s request to supplement and clarify claims that he had asserted prior to the \nState\u2019s filing  of its a nswer to his original petition ; and (3) directing Petitioner \u2019s counsel  to file a \nMemorandum clarifying the grounds for relief still being pursued.  ( D.I. 90) .  Thereafter, \nPetitioner \u2019s counsel filed a Memorandum  essentially stating that Petitioner was raising the same \n\u201cseveral distinct grounds for relief\u201d that had been  presented in his original \u201c pro se  habeas filing.\u201d  \n(D.I. 91 at 2) .  Petitioner filed a pro se  Supplement .  (D.I. 97) .  The State filed an Answer.  (D.I.  98).  \nPetitioner\u2019s counsel filed a Reply (D.I. 102), another Reply with Petitioner\u2019s additions (D.I. 103), \nand then another amendment to the Reply on Petit ioner\u2019s behalf  (D.I. 104).  From this point \nforward, the Court considers  Petition I (D.I. 3; D .I. 16), Petitioner\u2019s Memorandum (D.I. 91) , \nPetitioner\u2019s Supplement (D.I. 97) , and Petitioner\u2019s first Rep ly (D.I. 102)  as collectively comprising \nhis request for habeas relief, and will refer to his request as \u201cPetition.\u201d  \nII.   GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES  \nA.   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  \n \n Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \n\u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . . . and to further  the \nprinciples of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d  Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003).  \nPursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground that he is in custody in violation of the  Constitution or laws or treaties of the United \n \n2   The Court\u2019s Order dated March 9, 2021 provided Petitioner\u2019s counsel permission \u201cto \nassess whether to re- assert and /or refile  the pro se  motions that were denied\u201d when the \noriginal petition was denie d in October 2017.  (D.I. 88) (emphasis added) .  In granting such \npermission, t he Court contemplated that Petitioner\u2019s counsel would parse through those \nmotions and determine which, if any, could be re -asserted , and also provide an expla nation  \nfor that determination .   6 States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).  AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for \nanalyzing the merits of a habeas petition  in order to \u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure \nthat state -court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d  Bell v. Cone , 535 \nU.S. 685, 693 (2002).  \n B.   Exhaustion and Procedural Default  \n Absent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the \npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel , 526 U.S. 838, 842- 44 (1999);  Picard v. Connor , 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971).  \nAEDPA states, in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in \ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that \u2013 \n \n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State; or  \n \n(B)(i)  there is an absence of available State corrective process; or  \n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to            \nprotect the  rights of the applicant. \n \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).   \n The exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to give \n\u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete \nround of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d   O\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844- 45; see \nWerts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000).  A petitioner satisfies the exhaus tion \nrequirement by demonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct appeal or in a post -conviction proce eding, in a procedural manner permitting \nthe court to consider the  claims on their  merits .  See Bell v. Cone , 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005) ;  \nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989) . 7  A petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules \npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts.  See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 \n(3d Cir. 2000);  Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297- 98 (1989).  Although treated as technically \nexhausted, such claims are nonetheless procedurally defaulted.  See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160; \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750- 51 (1991).  Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas \nclaim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to review the merits \nof the claim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted.  See Coleman , 501 U.S. at 750;  Harris v. Reed , 489 U.S. 255, 260- 64 \n(1989).  Federal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the \npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the \nclaims.  See McCandless  v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999) ; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-\n51.  \nTo demonstrate cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective \nfactor external to the defense i mpeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural \nrule.\u201d  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986).  To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner \nmust show \u201cthat the errors at his  trial [] worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting \nhis entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d  United States v. Frady , 456 U.S. 152, 170 \n(1982).   If a petitioner attempts to excuse his default on the basis of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel, he can satisfy the prejudice component of the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard by meeting the prejudice standard needed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland.  See \nHolland v. Horn , 519 F.3d 107, 120 (3d Cir. 2008).   \n Alternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner demonstrates \nthat failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage  of justice.  See  Edwards v. 8 Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank,  266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001).  A \npetitioner demonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \u201cconstitutional violation has \nprobably resulted in the conviction of one w ho is actually innocent.\u201d  Murray, 477 U.S. at 496.  \nActual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency.  See Bousley v. United States , \n523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998) .  In order to establish actual innocence, the petitioner must present new \nreliable evidence \u2013 not presented at trial \u2013 that demonstrates \u201cit is more likely than not that no \nreasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  H ouse v. Bell , \n547 U.S. 518, 537- 38 (2006); see Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522 -24 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nC.   Standard of Review  \n When a state\u2019s highest court has adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits,3 the \nfederal court must review the claim und er the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(d).  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision \nwas an unreasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the state court proceeding.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)  & (2);  see Williams v. Taylor , 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000);   \nAppel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001).  Th e deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies \neven when a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has \nbeen denied.  See  Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S. 86, 98- 101 (2011).  As explained by the Supreme \nCourt, \u201cit may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state -law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d  Id. at 99. \n \n3    A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) if \nthe state court decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than \non a procedural or some other ground.  See  Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. \n2009).  9 A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court \narrives at a conclusion opposite to that rea ched by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if \nthe state court decides a case differently than [the Suprem e Court] has on a set of materially \nindistinguishable facts.\u201d  Williams , 529 U.S. at 413.  The mere failure to cite Supreme Court \nprecedent does not require a finding that the decision is contrary to clearly established federal law.  \nSee Early v. Packer , 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002).  For instance, a decision may comport with clearly \nestablished federal law even if the decision does not demonstrate an awareness of relevant Supreme Court cases, \u201cso long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state -court deci sion contradicts \nthem.\u201d  Id .  In turn, a n \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law occurs when \na state court \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle t o the facts of a prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d  Williams , 529 U.S. at \n413; see also White v. Woodall , 572 U.S. 415, 426 (2014) .   \n Finally, when performing an inquiry under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court must presume that \nthe state court\u2019s determinations of factual issues  are correct.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Appel , \n250 F.3d at 210.  This presumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact and is only rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7  2254(e)(1) ; Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000) ; Miller -El v. Cockrell , 537 \nU.S. 322, 341 (2003)  (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to \nfactual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).  \n  10 III. DISCUSSION  \n Petitioner  asserts the following f ive grounds for relief:4 (1) his habitual offender se ntence \nis illegal because one of the predicate convictions was invalid; (2) his guilty plea was not knowing, \nvoluntary, and intelligent ; (3) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance; ( 4) his confession \nwas coerced; and (5) he was denied  his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  \nA.  Claim One:  Illegal Habitual Offender Status  \nIn Claim One, Petitioner contend s that his habitual offender sentence is illegal because one \nof the predicate convictions used for habitual offender status \u2013 his 2009 forgery conviction from \nPennsylvania  \u2013 is illegal.  (D.I. 3 at 5); see also West , 2013 WL 6606833, at *7.  According to \nPetitioner, his 2009 Pennsylvania conviction is illegal because the Pennsylvania court  deprived \nhim of his  constitutional right to confront witnesses.5  (D.I. 3 at 5) .  Petition I explains that he is \n\u201cin [the] process of appealing PA convicti on.\u201d  ( Id.). \n \n4  Petition I  also include s a claim alleging that Petitioner  was subjected to cruel and unusual \npunishment because he had to sleep on the  floor without a mattress durin g pre-trial \nconfine ment.  (D.I. 3 at 10) .  To the extent this claim challenges prison  conditions  as an \nindependent claim , it does not assert an issue properly raised on federal habe as review.  \nThe Court  notes that Petitioner presented the same conditions/cruel and unusual  \npunishment argum ent in a  separate action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking  nine million \ndollars  in damages .  (See D.I. 1 at 10 in West v. Burley, Civ. A. No. 14- 1486- GMS).  On \nJuly 19, 2018, Judge Sleet dismissed  that case with prejudice pursuant to a joint stipulation \nby the par ties.  (See D.I. 87 and 88 in West , Civ. A. No. 14- 1486) .  In this  proceeding, t o \nthe extent Petitioner\u2019s allegations concerning lack of sleep and a lack of mattress provi de \nadditional background information for his involuntary plea argument, the Court will \nconsider it as part of the overall argument presented in Claim Two. \n    \n5  In his  Reply, Petitioner  asserts that his real contention in Claim One \u201cregarding the  \napplic ability of the \u2018habitual offender\u2019 statute to [his] sentencing is based on his claim that \nhis plea was not knowing and voluntary as he was denied adequate representation.\u201d  \n(D.I.  102 at 1) .  Petitioner does not clarify if the alleged inadequate representat ion about \nwhich  he complains in Claim One occurred during the guilty plea process with respect to \nhis 2009 Pennsylvania conviction or during the guilty plea process with respect to the 2012 \nDelaware conviction at issue in this proceeding.  To the extent the inadequate \nrepresen tation relates to the 2009 Pennsylvania conviction, the Court addresses it in its  \nanalysis of Claim One.  To the extent the inadequate representation relates to his 2012 11 Claim One is not a cognizable habeas claim.  First, to the extent Petitioner argues that the \nSuperior Court misapplied Delaware\u2019s habitual offender statute  to the facts of his case , the \nargument is a state law claim that does not provide a proper basis for federal habeas relief.  See  \nEstelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S. 62, 67- 68 (1991)  (opining that claims b ased on errors of state law are \nnot cognizable on habeas review.).    \nSecond, to the extent Petitioner is indirectly challenging the legality of his 2009 \nPennsylvania conviction for forgery, the argument  is foreclosed by well -settled Supreme Court \nprecedent.   In Lacakawana Cnty. Dist. Att\u2019y v. Coss , 532 U.S. 394 (2001) , the Supreme Court held \nthat,   \n[o]nce a state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral \nattack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), the conviction may be regarded as conclusively valid.  If that conviction is later used to enhance a criminal sentence, \nthe defendant generally may not challenge the enhanced sentence through a petition under \u00a7 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained. \n \nId. at 403 -04.  The only exce ption to this rule expressly recognized by the Supreme Court is if the \nprior enhancement conviction was obtained without t he defendant having counsel , in violation of \nthe Sixth Amendment  as set forth in Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 (1963).  See Coss , 532 \nU.S. at 404.   \nHere, Petitioner\u2019s 2009 Pennsylvania conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral \nattack because the 11.5  month \u2013 25 month sentence that was imposed for that conviction expired \n \nDelaware conviction, the Court construes Petitioner\u2019s explanation to be  asserting an  \nargumen t that his 2012 plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was not advised \nthat he would be  subje ct to sentencing as a habitual offender due to his 2009 Pennsylvani a \nconviction.  (See D.I. 99- 11 at 4- 5; D.I. 102 at 7; D.I. 102- 1 at 5 -9).  The Court view s this \nargument as part of Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the voluntariness of Pet itioner\u2019s guilty plea in \nClaim T wo.  \n 12 more than two years before Petitioner  filed the original habeas P etition in this case.6  To the extent \nPetitioner may be contending that he was provided inadequate representation during his 2009 \nPennsylvania case, only a complete denial of counsel with re spect to Petitioner\u2019s  2009 \nPennsylvania case would fall within the exception  to the presumption of validity recognized in \nCoss .  Given these circumstances, the Court regards Petitioner\u2019s 2009 Pennsylvania conviction as \n\u201cconclusively valid,\u201d meaning that th e 2009 conviction cannot provide a basis for challenging his \nhabitual offender sentence.  Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim One for failing to assert an \nissue cognizable on federal habeas relief.   \nB.  Claim Two:  Involuntary, Unknowing, and Unintelligent Guilty Plea  \nPetitioner  contends that his guilty plea  was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent because \nhe was under the influence of psychotropic medication and incompetent at the time he entered the  \nplea.  Petitioner asserts that the  follo wing \u201cwarning flags\u201d should have caused the Superior Court \nto conduct  an independent inquiry into his competency: (1) he had been in the psych ward section \nof the Howard R. Young facility on suicide watch; (2) at the time of his plea he was taking several prescribed medication s: Wellbutrin (anti- depressant) , Lithium (to treat Bipolar Disorder) , and \nRisperdal (anti -psychotic); and (3) he  was in a straight -jacket, restraint mittens, and a spit mask  \nduring the entire plea colloquy.\n7  (D.I. 102 at 1- 3).  Petitioner also contends that his guilty plea \nwas involuntary because : (1)  he was not appropriately informed that his 2009 Pennsylvania \nconviction could cause  him to be sentenced as an habitual offender  (D.I. 102 at 1) ; and (2) he  was \n \n6  (See D .I. 99- 2 at 29- 47). \n \n7  Petition I also includes  a separate claim alleging that  he suffered  \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d prison \nconditions, including being made to sleep on the floor without  a mat.  (D.I. 3 at 10) .  As \npreviously explained, the Court views this  contention as providing additional support for \nPetitioner\u2019s  argument  in Claim Two that he was not in the right state of mind to enter a \nguilty plea rather than as  assert ing an independent  ground for relief.  See supra Section \nIII.FN4.  13 coerced into pleading guilty because \u201cDeputy Warden Mark Emig [] told him to plead guilty or \nspend all 25 years to life butt naked in the hole\u201d (D.I. 3 at 12) . \nPetitioner presented Claim Two to the Superior Court in his Rule 61 motion and then to \nthe Delaw are Supreme Court on post -conviction appeal.  The Superior Court denied Claim Two \nas meritless, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that ruling \u201con the basis of, and for the \nreasons provided in, the [Superior Court] Commissioner\u2019s thorough and well -reasoned report and \nrecommendation that was adopted by the Superior Court.\u201d  West , 2014 WL 4264922, at *2.  Given \nthese circumstances, Petitioner will only be entitled to relief if the Superior Court\u2019s decision8 was \neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.   \nThe conviction of an accused while he is legally incompetent violates due process.  See \nPate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378 (1966) ; ); Drope v. Missouri , 420 U.S. 162, 172 (1975).   A \ndefendant is deemed competent to plead guilty if he has sufficient present ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational and factual understanding about the proceedings \nagainst him or if he assists in his defense.  See Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 396, 398- 99 (1993)  \n(holding that the standard governing competency to plead guilty is the same as that governing \ncompetency to sta nd trial) ; Dusky v. U.S., 362 U.S. 402 (1960)  (setting forth the standard governing \ncompetency to stan d trial).   The Supreme Court has identified several factors to be considered \nwhen assessing a defendant \u2019s competency to stand trial /enter a guilty plea , including attorney \nrepresentations, prior medical opinions regarding the defendant \u2019s mental competence to stand trial, \nevidence of the defendant \u2019s prior irrational behavior, and the defendant \u2019s demeanor at trial  or plea \n \n8  See Wilson v. Sellers , 138 S. Ct. 1188, 1193- 94 (2018) (reiterating that when a higher court \naffirms a lower court\u2019s judgment without an opinion or other explanation, federal habea s \nlaw employs a \u201clook through\u201d presumption and assumes that the later unexplained ord er \nupholding a lower court\u2019s reasoned judgment rests upon the same grounds as the lower \ncourt judgment).  14 colloquy.  See Drope , 420 U.S. at 177 n.13, 180.  Nevertheless , \u201c[e]ven when a defendant is \ncompetent at the commencement of his  trial, a trial court must always be alert to circumstances \nsuggesting a change\u201d in his competency.  Id. at 181.  Consequently, in order to satisfy the \nrequirements of due process, a trial court must sua sponte  conduct a competency hearing when \nthere is a reason to doubt the defendant \u2019s competency and the evidence is sufficient to put the trial \ncourt on notice of a potential competency problem.  See Pate, 383 U.S. at  385. \n   It is well settled that \u201ccompetency is a state court factual finding that, if suppo rted by the \nrecord, is presumed correct. \u201d  See Thompson v. Keohane , 516 U.S. 99, 111 (1995); Demosthenes \nv. Baal , 495 U.S. 731, 735  (1990) .  Implicit factual findings are presumed correct under \n\u00a7 2254(e)(1) to the same extent as express factual findings.  See Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d \n280 285\u201386 (3rd Cir.  2000).  Consequently, a court\u2019s  implicit and explicit factual findings that a \npetitioner  was competent are presumed correct, unless  the petitioner  can rebut the presumption of \ncorrectness by clear and convincing evidence.  See Taylor v. Horn, 504 F.3d 416, 433 (3d Cir.  \n2007). \nThe record in this case demonstrates that the Superior Court reasonably  determine d the \nfacts  when  implicitly finding that Petitioner was mentally competent to enter a guilty plea .  Prior \nto Petitioner\u2019s plea, defense counsel  filed a motion to have Petitioner undergo a psychiatric \nevaluation .  The Superior Court granted the motion and Petitioner was referred to the Delaware \nPsychiatric Center for an ev aluation to \u201cdetermin[e]  competency and to obtain treatment for his \nown well -being.\u201d  (D.I. 99- 6 at 142) .  In a Forensic Mental Health Examination Report (\u201cReport\u201d) \ndated November 8, 2011, the psychologist who evaluated Petitioner explained that Petitioner was \ntaking Lithium, Wellbutrin, and Risperdal  at the time of his psychiatric evaluation  \u2013 the same \nmedication s Petitioner stated he was taking at the time of his plea colloquy.  (D.I. 99- 6 at 16, 144).  \nThe Report  also detailed Petitioner\u2019s  polysubstance dependence and his diagnoses of major 15 depressive disorder and personality disorder with antisocial and borderline tra its, finding that those  \nfactors  did not \u201cappear at present to impede [ Petitioner\u2019s] capacities to understand his legal case, \nor to work with his attorney.\u201d  (D.I. 99- 6 at 154) .  The Report then concluded that Petitioner  \n\u201cpossesses adequate factual and ration understanding of this pending legal case, as well as adequate \ncapacity to assist in his own defense, and is therefore competent to stand trial .\u201d  (D.I. 99- 6 at 154) \n(emphasis in original) .   \nThe Report was provided to the Superior C ourt on December 1, 2011 and Petitioner\u2019s  plea \ncolloquy occurred on January 9, 2012.  At the opening of the  plea colloquy, defense counsel briefly \nmentioned Petitioner\u2019s mental health evaluation , the fact that he was taking prescription \nmedi cation, and the fact that he had been determined to be competent.  Defense counsel stated that  \nhe had met with Petitioner on several  occasions and that Petitioner was able to understand and \ncomprehend everything they had discussed.  Defense counsel also informed the Superior Court \nthat he believed Petitioner was entering the plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.  Thereafter, the Superior Court asked Petitioner: (1) if he was currently taking medication; ( 2) to \nidentify the medication; (3) if he was feeling well enough to enter a plea; and (4) if he understood everything defense counsel had represented to the court regarding the charges against Petitioner, \nthe potential sentences, and Petitioner\u2019s competency evaluation.  (D.I. 99- 6 at 15 -16).  Petitioner \nwas articulate and lucid i n his affirmative responses to the Superior Court\u2019s questions.  Petitioner  \nindicated that he had discussed his guilty plea with defense counsel, understood the plea and rights \nhe was waiving, and understood the nature and consequences of the proceeding.  Petitioner  was \naware enough to indicate that , although he and defense counsel had reviewed the plea agreement \nand Truth- in-Sentencing guilty plea form, they had not reviewed the indictment. The Superior \nCourt provided defense counsel an opportunity to review the indictment with Petitioner.  After confirming that Petitioner understood the charges in the indictment , the representations on the 16 Truth-in-Sentencing form, and that Petitioner was entering a guilty plea because he committed the \ncrimes, the Superior Court concluded that Petitioner\u2019s plea was \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and \nvoluntarily given.\u201d  (D.I. 99- 6 at 17) .   \nPetitioner contends that his appearance in court wearing a straight -jacket, restraint mittens, \nand a spit mask coupled with his medication regimen triggered  the Superior Court\u2019s duty to \nconduct an independent  inquiry into his competency.  The Court disagrees .  Petitioner himself \nacknowledges that the straight -jacket and \u201cr estraints were needed due to [his] propensity to harm \nhimself and being under suicide watch.\u201d  (D.I. 102 at 5) .  And, although the improper \nadministration of psychiatric medicine can render an individual temporarily incompetent,9 the fact \nthat a defendant is  taking medication for mental health issues does not per se  render a defendant \nincompetent to stand trial or automatically trigger a court\u2019s  duty to conduct an independent \ncompetency determination.  See, e.g., Layne v. Moore , 90 F. App\u2019x 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2004) ( the \nfact that petitioner was taking medications \u201cin itself does not show that he was mentally \nincompetent.\u201d); Sheley v. Singletary , 955 F.2d 1434, 1439 (11th  Cir. 1992)  (when  determining the \nadequacy of a court\u2019s inquiry into a defendant\u2019s competency, the \u201cfocus [ . . .] is what the  trial court \ndid in light of what it knew.\u201d ); Chichakly v. United States , 926 F.2d 624, 631- 32 (7th  Cir. 1991) \n(even if a defendant alleges  that he was incompetent due to psychiatric medications, \u201c[t]here is \ncertainly no need to conduct a competency hearing when there is no evidence before the Court of \nincompetency and when the defense attorney failed to request one and neither the prosecuting \nattorne y nor the judge saw a need for one.\u201d).  Rather, w hen presented with \u201csignificant evidence\u201d \nthat the defendant \u201chas recently taken drugs, the court has the obligation to inquire further before \n \n9  See Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 137 (1992).   17 determining that a competency hearing is necessary .\u201d  United State s v. Col e, 813 F .2d 43, 47 (3d \nCir. 1987)  (emphasis added).   \nThe record in this case shows that the Superior Court satisfied its obligation to make a \nthreshold inquiry into whether a more thorough and independent inquiry into Petitioner\u2019s \ncompetency  was necessary .  Defense counsel informed the Superior Court that he had several \nmeetings with Petitioner and believed Petitioner under stood the proceeding and could make a \nreasoned decision  to plead guilty.  Petitioner told the Superior Court that he was on medication \nand was able to identify the medication.  The  Superior Court asked Petitioner if he understood \nwhat was going on during the colloquy, and Petitioner answered affirmat ively .  Significantly, the \nSuperior Court was able to assess Petitioner\u2019s demeanor when answering its questions , and also \nknew that Peti tioner had been declared competent to enter a plea.  Nothing in this  record of the \nplea colloquy indicates that Petitioner did not understand the nature of the proceedings against him \nor that he could not consult with defense counsel to assist in his case.  See Indiana v. Edwards , \n554 U.S. 164, 170 (2008) ; United States v.  Lessner , 498 F.3d 185, 96 (3d Cir. 2007).  Thus, given \nPetitioner\u2019s failure to provide clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Court accepts the Superior Court\u2019s implicit factual determination that Petitioner was competent to enter a guilty \nplea.\n10 \n \n10  To the extent Petitioner argues that a psychiatric evaluation ordered by the  Delaware \nSuperior  Court in February 2015 is relevant to the Court\u2019s instant analysis, the argument is \nunavailing.  As a factual matter, the Superior Court did not order a new competency \nevaluation , but rather, ordered a psychiatric evaluation to \u201c[d]etermine  psychiatric or  \npsychological treatment.\u201d  (D.I. 21- 1 at 1) .  Additionally , an evaluation of Pet itioner\u2019s \ncompetency performed years after he entered his guilty plea has no bearing on the \ndetermination of his competency at the time of his guilty plea.  For thes e reaso ns, the Court \nalso rejects Petitioner\u2019s contention that the transcript of the clarification of his sentence \nthat occurred in May and June 2016 demonstrates \u201chis lack of m ental ability to know what \noccurred in January 2012.\u201d  (D.I. 102 at 7) . 18 Having found that the Superior Court reasonably determined the facts  when implicitly \nconcluding that Petitioner was legally competent to enter a guilty plea, the  Court must next \ndetermine if the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that Petit ioner\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary, knowing, \nand intelligent was contrary to, or based upon an unreasonable application of, clearly established \nfederal law.   In cases where the petitioner\u2019s conviction rests on a guilty plea, the \u201cfocus of federal \nhabeas inquiry is the nature of [defense counsel\u2019s] advice and the voluntariness of the plea, not the \nexistence as such of an antecedent constitutional infirmity.\u201d  Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 266 (1973).  The voluntariness of a plea \u201ccan be determined only by consi dering all of the relevant \ncircumstances surrounding it.\u201d  Brady v. United States , 397 U.S. 742, 749 (1970).  When assessing \nthe voluntary nature of a plea, the representations made by a defendant under oath during a guilty plea colloquy \u201cconstitute a form idable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings\u201d and \u201ccarry \na strong presumption of verity.\u201d  Blackledge v. Allison , 431 U.S. 63, 74 (1977).  As explained by \nthe Third Circuit, \u201c[t]he ritual of the [plea] colloquy is but a means toward determining whether the plea was voluntary and knowing.  A transcript showing full compliance with the customary \ninquiries and admonitions furnishes strong, although not necessarily conclusive, evidence that the accused entered his plea without coercion and with an appreciation of its consequences.\u201d  United \nStates v. Stewart , 977 F.2d 81, 84 (3d Cir. 1992). \nHere, although that the Superior Court did not reference federal law when denying \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was not properly informed \nabout the effect of his 2009 Pennsylvania conviction and because his confession was coerced, the \nSuperior Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law  because it cited \nDelaware cases which articulate the standard in Bla ckledge .\n11  The Court also concludes that the \n \n11  The Superior  Court cited  State v. Harden, 1998 WL 735879, *5 (Del. Super.  Ct. 1998) \nand State v. Stuart , 2008 WL 4868658, *3 (Del. Super. Ct. 2008).  These cases  either cite 19 Superior Court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law  when denying Claim \nTwo.  Th e transcript of Petitioner\u2019s plea colloquy demonstrates that Petitioner was informed that \nhe would be declared a habitual offender and that his  2009 Pennsylvania conviction would serve \nas one of the three predicate convictions.  (D.I. 99 -6 at 15) .  The transcript  contains his clear and \nexplicit statements that he had discussed his case with defense counsel  and understood that, if \nsentenced as a habitual offender, he faced a minimum mandatory sentence of 25 years to life for \nthe first-degree robbery charge.  He responded affirmatively when asked if he was \u201cfreely and \nvoluntarily pleading guilty to these charges,\u201d and responded negatively when asked if \u201canyone threatened or forced [him] to enter in this plea.\u201d  (D.I. 99 -6 at 17) .  In turn, the Truth- In-Sentencing \nGuilty Plea Form signed by Petitioner indicates that he knowingly and voluntarily entered into his plea agreement; he had not been promised anything not contained in the plea agreement; he was not forced or threatened to enter the plea agreement; and he knew he faced a possible maximum sentence of life  under the criminal penalty statutes, with a minimum mandatory sentence of twenty -\nfive years.  (D.I. 99 -6 at 19) . \nPetitioner has failed to  provide compelling evidence as to why the statements he made \nduring the plea colloquy and on the Truth- in-Sentencing Form should not be presumptively \naccepted as true.  Therefore, based on the aforementioned record, the Court concludes that the \nSuperior Court  reasonably applied Blackledge in holding that Petitioner was bound by the \nrepresentations he made during the plea colloquy and on the Truth- In-Sentencing form.  \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two for failing to satisfy the standard articulated in \n\u00a7 2254(d).   \n  \n \nto Blackledge and articulate the same standard or cite to other Delaware decisions wh ich \ncite Blackledge.    20 C.  Claim  Three:  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel   \nAs a general rule, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are reviewed pursuant to the \ntwo-pronged standard established in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  Under the \nfirst Strickland prong, the petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel \u2019s representation fell below an \nobjective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with reasonableness being judged under professional norms \nprevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance.   Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. The second \nStrickland prong requires the petitioner to demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but \nfor counsel \u2019s error the result would have been different.\u201d   Id. at 687\u201396.  A reasonable probability \nis a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outc ome.\u201d  Id. at 688.  In the context of \na guilty plea, a petitioner satisfies Strickland\u2019 s prejudice prong by demonstrating that, but for \ncounsel \u2019s error, there is a reasonable probability that he would have insisted on proceeding to trial \ninstead of pleading guilty.  See Hill v. Lockhart , 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985).  A petitioner must make \nconcrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary dismissal.  See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259- 60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891- 92 \n(3d Cir. 1987).  A court can choose to address the prejudice prong before the deficient performance prong, and reject an ineffective assistance of counsel claim solely on the ground that the defendant \nwas not prejudiced.  See  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698.  Finally, although not insurmountable, the \nStrickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d  Strickland , 466 U.S. at 689. \nIn United States v. Cronic , 466 U.S. 648, 659 n. 25 (1984), the United States Supreme \nCourt articulated a very limited exception to Strickland\u2019 s prejudice requirement, holding that there \nare three situations in which prejudice caused by an attorney\u2019 s performance will be presumed: \nwhere the defendant is completely denied counsel at a critical stage; where \u201ccounsel entirely fails \nto subject the prosecution\u2019 s case to meaningful adversarial testing;\u201d or where the circumstances 21 are such that there is an ext remely small likelihood that even a competent attorney could provide \neffective assistance, such as when the opportunity for cross -examination has been eliminated.  See \nCronic , 466 U.S. at 659 & n.25.  With respect to exception two, the Cronic  presumption of \nprejudice only applies when counsel has completely failed to test the prosecution\u2019 s case throughout \nthe entire trial.  See Bell v. Cone , 535 U.S. 685, 697 (2002).  \nIn Claim Three, Petitioner contends that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance \nby: (1) failing file a motion to suppress based on Petitioner\u2019s assertion that his confession was \ncoerced  (D.I. 3 at 7) ; (2) failing to keep him informed of discovery (Id.); (3) not consistently \ncommunicating with Petitioner during the time -period leading up to the guilty plea because of the \nrestrictions placed on Petitioner\u2019s access to phone and mail  (Id.); and (4) letting another public \ndefender represent him during the preliminary hearing (D.I. 16 at  1).  \nThe record reveals that Petitioner did no t present sub- argument four concerning a different \npublic defender representing him during his preliminary hearing to the Delaware Supreme Court \nin any of his state post -conviction proceedings.  Although the Court concurs with the State\u2019s \nassertion that th is particular sub -argument is therefore procedurally barred from habeas review, \nthe Court will deny the argument as meritless.  As Petitioner  concedes that he was represented by \na substitute assistant public defender during his preliminary hearing, Cronic  is inapplicable to  \nPetitioner\u2019s  instant complaint.  H is argument also fails to warrant relief under Strickland and Hill, \nbecause he does not assert any specific allegations of deficient performance or prejudice with respect to the representation provided by the s ubstitut e assistant public defender . \nAs for the remaining sub- arguments in Claim Three, t he Delaware Supreme Court rejected \nthe arguments as meri tless in Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 61 appeal  after reviewing them  under a \nstandard identical to the Strickland/Hill standard.  In his Reply, Petitioner  asserts that the Delaware \nSupreme Court erred by applying the Strickland/Hill standard to these three sub -arguments of  22 Claim Three because it should have presumed prejudice pursuant to Chronic  . (D.I. 102 at 7)  He \nargues that  defense \u201ccounsel entirely fai led to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful \nadversarial testing\u201d by \u201cfail[ing] to provide and discuss discovery [and] review all the evidence \nwith [Petitioner] .\u201d  (D.I. 102 at 8) .   \nGiven Petitioner \u2019s presentation, the C ourt construes the remainder of Claim Three as \nalleging  that Petitioner\u2019s  case falls within the second exception identified in Cronic .  Petitioner, \nhowever, cannot demonstrate that he suffered the complete lack of representation required to \ninvoke the Cronic  exception.  The record reveals that defense counsel filed a motion  for reduction \nof bail, a motion to have Petitioner undergo a psychiatric evaluation, and negotiated a plea offer \nthat provided a substantial benefit to Petitioner .  Accordingly, Cronic  is inapplicable, and the Court \nwill consider Petitioner\u2019s remaining three ineffective assistance of counsel allegations under \nStrickland and  Hill.  \nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the Delaware \nSupreme Court did not specifically apply the Strickland/Hill standard when affirming the Superior \nCourt \u2019s decision.  Nevertheless, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court \u2019s decision \nwas not contrary to Strickland or Hill, because  the Delaware cases12 cited by the Delaware \nSupreme Court refe r to the applicable precedent.  See Fahy v. Horn, 516 F.3d 169, 196 (3d Cir.  \n2008) (Supreme Court of Pennsylvania \u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established Federal \nlaw because appropriately relied on its own state court cases, which articulated the proper standard \nderived from Supreme Court precedent); Williams,  529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A] run- of-the-mill state -\ncourt decision applying the correct legal r ule from [Supreme Court] cases to the facts of a \nprisoner \u2019s case [does] not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause\u201d) . \n \n12  The Delaware Supreme Court cited to Foote v. State , 38 A.3d 1254 (Table), 2012 WL \n562791 (Del. Feb. 21, 2012) , which cited to cases that relied on Strickland and Hill.  23 The Delaware Supreme Court also reasonably applied clearly established federal law when \ndenying the first three sub -arguments in Claim Three.  Citing to Delaware precedent articulating \nthe same principles set forth in Blackledge, t he Delaware Supreme Court determined that Petitioner \nfailed to satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland and Hill because the record reflected \u201cthat the \nplea provided a substantial benefit to [Petitioner], and that [Petitioner] discussed the plea \nextensively with his trial counsel and was satisfied with trial counsel\u2019s representation.\u201d  West , 2014 \nWL 4264922, at *2.  As previously discussed with respect to Claim Two, Petitioner has failed to \nprovide any compelling reason as to why the statements he made during the plea colloquy should not be presumptively accepted as tr ue.  Consequently, the Court finds that the Delawa re Supreme \nCourt reasonably applied Blackledge in holding Petitioner bound by the representations he made \nduring his plea colloquy.   \nGiven this determination, the Court further concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court \nreasonably applied the Strickland/Hi ll standard in holding that Petitioner failed to demonstrate that \nhe suffered actual prejudice as a result of defense counsel\u2019s actions .  Accordingly, the Court will \ndeny Claim Three for failing to satisfy the standard in \u00a7 2254(d).  \nD.  Claim Four:  Coerced Confession  \nIn Claim Four, Petitioner contends that his confession was coerced because the \u201carresting \nofficers told me they would kill me if I didn\u2019t confess .\u201d  (D.I. 3  at 12 ).  On post -conviction appeal, \nthe Delaware Supreme Court denied Claim Four  as waived by Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea .  See West , \n2014 WL 4264922, at *2.   \nAs articulated by the Supreme Court in Tollett v. Henderson:  \n[A] guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has \npreceded it in the criminal process.  When a crimi nal defendant has \nsolemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional 24 rights that occurred prior to the entry of the  guilty plea.  He may \nonly attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea \nby showing that the advice he received from counsel was [constitutionally ineffective].  \nTollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973).  A voluntary and knowing guilty plea bars a \ndefendant from raising antecedent non- jurisdictional\n13 constitutional violations \u201cnot logically \ninconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt and which do not stand in the way of \nconviction if factual guilt is established.\u201d  Menna v. New York , 423 U.S. 61, 62 n. 2 (1975).   \n Once again, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not reference federal law when \ndenying Claim Four , its decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law because it \nappropriately reli ed on Delaware case law articulating the proper federal standard.  Additionally, \nbecause Petitioner\u2019s plea was counseled, knowing, and voluntary, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s \ndenial of Claim Four did not involve an unreasonable application of Tollett or Menna.   \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim F our for failing to satisfy the standard in \u00a7 2254(d).  \nE.  Claim Five:  Denial of Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel  \nIn his final Claim, Petitioner appears to argue that he was denied his Sixth Amendment \nright to  counsel of choice because, due to the \u201csevere nature of [his] confinement\u201d (including \n\u201cdeprivation of phone and mail privileges as well as visits\u201d), he \u201cwas not aware [his] family had offered to cover the fee for private counsel.\u201d  ( D.I. 16; D.I. 99 -5 at 1) .  He also appears to argue \nthat he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of access to counsel because the conditions of his confinement prevented him from discussing his case privately with defense counsel.  ( D.I. 16; \nD.I. 99- 3 at 187) .  Based on the foregoing, the Court views  Claim Six  as alleging that the conditions \n \n13  As explained by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the term non- jurisdictional is \nsomewhat confusing; rather, \u201c[t]he most accurate statement of the law would be . . . [th at \na] guilty plea waives all defenses except those that go to the court \u2019s sub ject-matter \njurisdiction and the narrow class of constitutional claims involving the right not to be haled \ninto court.\u201d  United States v. DeVaughn, 694 F.3d 1141, 1193 (10th Cir. 2012). 25 of Petitioner\u2019s confinement constructively deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right of access \nto counsel and his right to counsel of choice.  Petitioner vaguely asserted these argume nts in his \nfirst Rule 61 proceeding, but t he Delaware state courts did not address them .  For the following \nreasons, the Court concludes that both arguments lack merit.  \n1.  Right to c ounsel -of-choice  \nAlthough the Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant an absolute right to the \nassistance of counsel, it does not guarantee a defendant an absolute right to counsel of his choice.  \nSee Wheat v. United States , 486 U.S. 153, 159 (1988) ; United Sates v. Gonzalez -Lopez , 548 U.S. \n140, 151- 52 (2006).  \u201c[T]he essential aim of the [Sixth] Amendment is to guarantee an effective \nadvocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d  Whea t, 486 U.S. at  159.  A defendant has \u201cthe right \nto be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds .\u201d  Caplin & Drysdale, \nChartered v. United States , 491 U.S. 617, 624 -25 (1989).  An erroneous deprivation of the right \nto choice of counsel constitutes a structural error requiring reversal of a criminal defendant \u2019s \nconviction.  See Gonzalez -Lopez , 548 U.S. at 150.  Importantly, however, t he Sixth Amendment \nright to counsel of cho ice does not extend beyond a defendant \u2019s right to spend his own \nnonforfeitable assets.  See United States v. Jamieson, 427 F.3d 394, 405 (6th Cir. 2005). \nHere, Petitioner  does not allege that  (a) he was  denied the right to use his own assets to \nretain a private attorney ; (b) he was  unhappy with defense counsel \u2019s representation  during the \npretrial stage and communicated that dissatisfaction to the Superior Court ; and/or (c)  he requested \nand was denied substitute counsel.  Notably, during the plea colloquy, Petitioner did not express \nany dissatisfaction with defense counsel\u2019s representation when asked if he had any questions or 26 concerns .  (D.I. 99- 6 at 17) .  Thus,  Petitioner  has failed to demonstrate how the conditions of his \npre-trial confinement constructively or actually deprived him of his right to counsel of choice.  \n2.  Right of a ccess to counsel  \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel includes the \u201copportunity for . . . counsel to \nconfe r, to consult with the accused, and to prepare his defense.\u201d  Avery v. Alabama , 308 U.S. 444, \n446 (1940).  Complete denial of the assistance of counsel \u2013 whether real or constructive \u2013 is per \nse reversible error.  See Perry v. Leeks , 488 U.S. 272, 280 (1989).  Nevertheless, not every \nrestriction on counsel\u2019s access to the defendant constitutes a deprivation of the right to counsel in \nviolation of the Sixth Amendment.  See id . at 280- 85 (holding that prohibition of consultation \nbetween defendant and defense counsel during brief recess between defendant \u2019s testimony on \ndirect and cross -examination did not amount to complete denial of counsel). \nIn this case, even if the conditions of Petitioner\u2019s confinement rendered defense counsel\u2019s \nrepresentation of Petit ioner more difficult, those difficulties did not amount to a complete denial \nof access to counsel .  Petitioner was represented by defense counsel when he entered his guilty \nplea.  Defense counsel stated, without correction or objection by Petitioner, \u201cI\u2019ve  met with \n[Petitioner] on a number of different occasions . . . And he has been able to understand and \ncomprehend everything we\u2019ve discussed. \u201d  (D.I. 99 -6 at 15) .  When v iewed in context with  defense \ncounsel\u2019s unopposed statement regarding meeting with Petitioner several times before the plea \ncolloquy, Petitioner \u2019s instant bald and unsupported assertion does  not explain how the lack of \nprivacy and restrictions on his access to the phone, mail, and passing documents deprived him of \nhis access to counsel.   \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Five as meritless .   \n  27 IV.   CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY  \n When a district court issues a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition, the court must also \ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011).  A certificate \nof appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a \nconstitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2);  Slack v. \nMcDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).  If a federal court denies a habeas petition on procedural \ngrounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason wo uld find it \ndebatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling.  Id.  \nThe C ourt has concluded that the instant Petition  fails to warrant federal h abeas relief  and \nis persuaded that reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable.  Therefore, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.  \nV.   CONCLUSION \n For the reasons stated, the instant  Petition for habeas  relief pursu ant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is \ndenied without an evidentiary hearing or the issuance of a certificate of appealability.  An appropriate O rder shall issue. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nCHRISTOPHER H.
