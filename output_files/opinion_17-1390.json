Civil Action No. 17- 1390- RGA \n \nMEMORANDUM  \n  Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction until April 5, 2022, to prevent automated blending \nat Powder Springs.  (D.I. 763).  The motion has been fully briefed.  ( D.I. 764, 782, 785).   \n Given the usua l backlog of cases and motions  in this District, it is regrettable that the \nparties could not resolve this without me.  This is particularly so because Defendant s seem to \nhave stopped the infringing conduct after the adverse verdict.  (D.I. 782- 2 (Hitz D ecl.)).  \nDefendant s do not object to the form of Plaintiff\u2019s proposed permanent injunction.  Plaintiff does \nnot argue that what Defendant s say they  will do is insufficient to avoid infringe ment.  Thus, I \nconclude that Defendant s have stated that they  will abide by what Plaintiff seems to concede is \nall that is required to avoid infringement.   \n I will separately enter a modifi cation of the proposed permanent  injunction, without \nmaking any of the findings required for a permanent injun ction, recognizing that at this time it is \nessentially a \u201cmaintain the status quo\u201d order.  I see no prejudice to either side in doing so, and it \nputs the Court\u2019s imprimatur  on Plaintiff\u2019s request that Defendant s adhere to what Defendant s \nhave voluntarily a greed to do. Page 2 of 2  \n A separate order  will issue.  The motion (D.I. 763) is RESOLVED. \nEntered this 14th day of January 2022.  \n \n       /s/ Richard G.
