Hall", "date": "07-12-2022", "ocr_text": "   \n \n   \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nSANOFI -AVENTIS U.S. LLC , et al. ,  \n \nPlaintiff s, \n \nv. \n \nAPOTEX CORP. , et al. , \n \nDefendant s.   \n \nC.A. No. 20- cv-804-RGA  \n(Consolidated)  \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \nThis dispute  puts the race in to res judicata.  Despite Sanofi\u2019s1 speed to protect its market \nexclusivity \u2014or perhaps because of it \u2014I conclude that it cannot maintain  its claims  against \nDefendants  for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,927,592 (\u201c\u02bc592 patent\u201d) .  Sanofi  already sued \nDefendants  once  for infringement of the \u02bc592 patent and lost.  But Sanofi  obtained some  substitute  \npatent  claims  during an inter partes  review, and now it wants  to sue Defendants again  on the \u02bc592 \npatent and assert th ose substitute claims .  Having carefully considered the relevant  Federal Circuit \nprecedent , I conclude that Sanofi\u2019s  new allegations of  infringement of the \u02bc592 patent are barred \nby the doctrine of claim preclusion.  Accordingly, I recommend that the Court  GRANT \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss those counts . \nDefendants also argue that the Court should dismiss Sanofi\u2019s claims for infringement  of \ntwo other patents , U.S. Patent Nos. 10,583,110 ( \u201c\u02bc110 patent)  and 10,716,777 ( \u201c\u02bc777 patent \u201d).  The \nparties have been litigating those  patents  in this case  for two years, the Court has construed the \n \n1 Plaintiffs Sanof i-Aventis U.S. LLC and Sanofi Mature IP are collectively referred to as \nSanofi.    \n \n2 \n claims, and fact and expert discovery is largely compl ete.  Sanofi has plausibly alleged that \nDefendants\u2019 proposed labels will encourage patented uses, so I recommend that the  Court DENY \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Sanofi\u2019s allegations of  infringement of the \u02bc110 and \u02bc777 patents.   \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe procedural history is tortuous, but a  recitation is  important to understanding the present \ndispute .   \nSanofi sells the drug JEVTANA\u00ae  (cabazitaxel ), which is approved by the FDA for use in \ncombina tion with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic  castration -resistant \nprostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel -containing treatment  regimen.   (D.I. 248 \n(\u201cSAC\u201d) \u00b6 80.)  Between 2014 and 2016, several drug manufacturers, including Defendants \nApotex Corp., Apotex Inc. (collectively \u201cApotex\u201d) , and Sandoz , Inc. (\u201cSandoz\u201d) , filed  regulatory \nsubmissions \u2014Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\u201cANDAs\u201d)  and New Drug Applications \npursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(2) (\u201c (b)(2) NDAs\u201d) \u2014seeking FDA ap proval to market cabazitaxel \nproducts.  (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 10\u201311.)   At th at time, Sanofi had three patents listed in the Orange Book for \ncabazitaxel , including the \u02bc592 patent and U.S. Patent No. 5,847,170 (\u201c\u02bc170 patent\u201d).   The  filers \nsought to market their products prior to the expiration of Sanofi\u2019s patents , so Sanofi promptly sued \nthem for infringement in district court in the District of New Jersey .   \nWhile the New Jersey cases  were ongoing, one of the New Jersey  defendants, Mylan  \nLaboratories Limited  (\u201cMylan\u201d) , filed for inter  partes review  (IPR) of the \u2019 592 patent , which \nclaimed  methods of using cabazitaxel .  (D.I. 255 at 2.)  The Patent T rial and Appeal Board (PTAB) \ninstituted an IPR for claims 1 \u20135 and 7\u201330 in September 2016, which meant that the final written \ndecision would issue by September 2017, when trial in the New Jersey cases was scheduled.  In its institution decision, the PTAB held that the preambles of independent claim s 1 (\u201cmethod for    \n \n3 \n treating a patient  . . .\u201d) and 27 (\u201cmethod of increasing the survival of a patient  . . .\u201d) were \u201cnon-\nlimiting ,\u201d which meant the only claim  limitations were administering the specified drugs to the \nspecified patients.2  Mylan Labs. Ltd. v. Aventis Pharma S.A., No. IPR2016- 00712, 2016 WL \n5753968, at 3\u20135 (P.T.A.B. Sept. 22, 2016).  Th e PTAB\u2019s institution decision led  Sanofi to file a  \ncontingent motion to replace independent claim 27  and dependent claims 28\u201330 with new  \nindependent claim 31 and new dependent claims 32\u201334 to make \u201cincreasing survival\u201d in claim \n27\u2019s preamble a cl aim limitation and to add  a three- component premedication regimen  that Sanofi \ncontended was not disclosed in the prior art.3   Mylan Labs. Ltd. v. Aventis Pharma S.A., 2017 WL \n4221400, at *1, *27\u201329 (P.T.A.B. Sept. 21, 2017) ; see also D.I. 255 at 2.  \nMeanw hile, Sanofi moved to stay the New Jersey cases  to await the outcome of the IPR.  \n(C.A. No. 14-7869, D.I. 136- 1 (D.N.J.) .)  The New Jersey court denied the motion to stay and \npresided over a consolidated bench trial from September 8\u201329, 2017.   The New Jer sey court found \n \n2 Original claim 1 provided: \u201c1. A method for treating a patient with prostate cancer that \nhas progressed during or after tre atment with docetaxel, comprising administering to said patient \na dose of 20 to 25 mg/ m2 of cabazitaxel, or a hydrate or solvate thereof, in combination with a  \ncorticoid.\u201d    \nOriginal claim 27 provided: \u201c27. A method of increasing the survival of a patient with a \ncastration resistant or hormone refractory, metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed during or \nafter treatment with docetaxel, comprising administering a dose of 20 to 25 mg/ m2 of cabazitaxel, \nor hydrate or solvate thereof, to the patient in combination with prednisone or prednisolone.\u201d  \n3 Claim 31 provides: \u201c31. (substitute for claim 27) A method of increasing survival \ncomprising administering to a patient in need  thereof (i) an anti histamine, (ii) a corticoid, (iii) an \nH2 antagonist, and (iv) a dose of 20 to 25 mg/ m2 of cabazitaxel,  or a hydrate or solvate thereof \nwherein said antihistamine,  said corticoid, and said H 2 antagonist are administered  prior to said \ndose of 20 to 25 mg/ m2 of cabazitaxel, or  hydrate or solvate thereof in combination with prednisone  \nor prednisolone, wherein said patient has castration resis tant or hormone refractory, metastatic \nprostate cancer that has progressed during or after treatment with docetaxel. \u201d   \nSanofi took the position before the PTAB that \u201c the proposed substitute claims add elements \nto claims 27 \u201330 of the \u2019592 patent and do not remove any limitations.\u201d  Mylan Labs. Ltd. v. Aventis \nPharma S.A., 2017 WL 4221400, at *29.    \n \n4 \n that Sanofi\u2019s \u02bc170 patent was valid and infringed, and the court issued an injunction against \napproval of the defendants\u2019  regulatory applications  until the \u02bc170 patent expired on September 26, \n2021.  See Sanofi -Aventis U.S. LLC v. Fresenius  Kabi USA, LLC  (Sanofi I ), No. 14- 7869, 2018 \nWL 9364037, at *4  (D.N.J. Apr. 25, 2018) .  As for the \u02bc592 patent, t he New Jersey court  ultimately \nfound that dependent claims 21 and 304 had non- limiting preambles and were obvious.5  Id. at *5, \n*18, *35.  Sano fi did not appeal the district court\u2019s finding that claims 21 and 30 were obvious.  \nSee Sanofi -Aventis U.S. LLC v. Dr. Reddy\u2019s Labs., Inc., 933 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2019).   \nWhile the New Jersey trial was occurring, the PTAB issued a  final written de cision  finding \nthat original claims 1 \u20135 and 7\u201330 of the \u02bc592 patent were obvious and denying Sanofi\u2019s contingent \nmotion to amend.  Mylan Labs. Ltd. v. Aventis Pharma S.A., 2017 WL 4221400, at *2.  Sanofi appealed the denial of its contingent motion to amend.  On appeal , the Federal Circuit ruled that \nthe PTAB had erred by construing th e preamble of proposed substitute claim 31 (\u201cmethod of \nincreasing survival  . . .\u201d)  as non- limiting and by putting the burden on Sanofi to prove that the \nproposed substitute  claims were valid.  Sanofi Mature IP v. Mylan Labs. Ltd., 757 F. App\u2019x 988, \n992 (Fe d. Cir. 2019).  On remand, the PTAB concluded that  Mylan had not shown substitute claims \n31\u201334 were obvious .  Mylan Labs. Ltd. v. Aventis Pharma S.A., 2019 WL 5430242, at *13 \n \n4 Claim 21 depended on claim  20, which depended on claim 1 (\u201cmethod of treating a patient  \n. . .\u201d).  Claim 30 depended on claim 27 ( \u201cmethod of increasing the survival of a patient  . . .\u201d).   \n5 Sanofi actually asserted at trial claims  7, 11, 14\u2013 16, 21, 26, and 30.  No. 14- 7869, 2018 \nWL 9364037, at *35.  However, the IPR led Sanofi to disclaim claims 7, 11, 14\u201316, and 26 before \nthe New Jersey court\u2019 s judgment, and that court\u2019s  finding that those claims were obvious was later \nvacated by the Federal Circuit as moot.  Sanofi -Aventis U.S. LL C v. Dr. Reddy\u2019s Labs., Inc., 933 \nF.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  Hence, the claims ultimately held invalid in the New Jersey \naction were 21 and 30.     \n \n5 \n (P.T.A.B. Oct. 22, 2019) .  The Federal Circuit su mmarily affirmed ,6 and the amended claim s \nissue d on August 23, 2021.  (SAC, Ex. A at 23.)  \nMeanwhile, in June  and July 2020, Sanofi filed complaints in this Court against Defendants \nApotex, Sandoz, and others , alleging tha t the sale of the products  described in their 2014 regulatory \nsubmissions  would infringe Sanofi\u2019s more recently  issued \u02bc110 patent (issued March 10, 2020)  \nand \u02bc777 patent (issued  July 21, 2020) .  The Court held a Markman hearing on December 17, 2020, \nand issued a claim construction order on January  11, 2021.  (D.I. 215.)  F act and expert discovery \non those  patents is largel y (if not totally) complete.  ( See D.I. 267.)   \nOn August 30, 2021,  a few days after the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) issued the \ncertificate of amendment  for the \u2019 592 patent , Sanofi filed a Second Amended Complaint against  \nDefendants  that added allegations of  infringement of the substitute claims of th e \u02bc592 patent.  On \nSeptember 13, 2021, Defendants Apotex and Sandoz filed their motion to dismiss the SAC .  \nDefendants argue that the doctrine of claim preclusion bars Sanofi from asserting the \u02bc592 patent \nagainst Defendants a second time.  Defendants also argue that the SAC fails to plausibly allege \nthat the sale of their products will induce infringement of the \u02bc110 and \u02bc777 patents.   \nThe trial is currently scheduled to begin on January 11, 2023.  (D.I. 267.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA defendant may move to dismiss  a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, \na complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief tha t \nis plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \n \n6 See Fed. Cir. R. 36.      \n \n6 \n \u201cfactual content that al lows the court to draw the reas onable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of relief is not \nenough.  Id.   \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant\u2019s \nliability, it \u2018 stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  \nId. (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201cwell- pleaded facts\u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions.  Id.  at 679.  \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency \nshould be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of tim e and money by the parties and the \ncourt.\u201d  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (quotation omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. \u02bc592 patent  \nDefendants argue that claim preclusion bars Sanofi from asserting the \u02bc592 patent  because \nSanofi previously sued Defendants for infringement of that  patent in a case that went to final \njudgment.  The doctrine of claim preclusion  says that  \u201ca ju dgment on the merits in a prior suit bars \na second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.\u201d   \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore , 439 U.S. 322, 327 n.5 (1979) ; SimpleAir, Inc. v. Google LLC , 884 \nF.3d 1160, 1165 (Fed. C ir. 2018) .  The Federal Circuit applies  regional circuit law with respect to \nthe general prin ciples of claim preclusi on.  Senju Pharm. Co. v. Apotex Inc., 746 F.3d 1344, 1348 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014).  In the Third Circuit , claim preclusion requires (1) a final judgment on the merits \nin a prior suit involving (2) the same parties (or their privies) and (3) a subsequent suit based on \u201cthe same cause of action. \u201d  Id. (quoting CoreStates Bank, N.A. v. Huls Am., Inc., 176 F.3d 187, \n194 (3d Cir. 1999) ).  The parties do not dispute that the first two elements  are satisfied here:    \n \n7 \n Sanofi\u2019s current case involves the same Apotex and Sandoz regulatory filings as the prior New \nJersey cases  that went to final judgment .   \nThe parties vigorously dispute whether  the final element  is satisfied: is  Sanofi\u2019s current \nassertion  that Defendants\u2019 regulator y filings infringe the  amended \u02bc592 patent claims \u201cthe same \ncause of action\u201d as Sanofi\u2019s pr evious assertion that those same filings infringed the original claims \nof the \u02bc592 patent ?7  Whether a second suit for patent infringement is based on \u201cthe same cau se of \naction\u201d as an earlier suit  is a question of Federal Circuit law.  Id.   The Federal Circuit \u201cgenerally \nfollow[s] the Restatement (Second) of Judgments ( [Am. Law Inst.] 1982) (hereinaf ter \nRestatement), which defines a cause of action based on the transactional facts from which it \narises\u201d\u2014i ncluding the accused activity and the asserted patent claims.   SimpleAir, 884 F.3d at \n1165 (citing Restatement \u00a7 24  cmt. b ); Acumed LLC v. Stryker Co rp., 525 F.3d 1319, 1323\u201324 \n(Fed. Cir. 2008) . \nThe question here is this: under what circumstances is a patentee\u2019s assertion of amended \nclaims that i ssued out of an IPR proceeding considered the same cause of action  as a prior suit \ninvolving original claims  in the same patent ?  The parties did  not cite, and the Court is not aware \nof, any Federal Circuit case addressing how claim preclusion applies to  these precise \ncircumstances.   As explained below, however , the Federal Circuit has had occasion to address how \nclaim preclusion applies to multiple suits on the same patent when the patentee obtained amended \nclaims through other administrative proceedings.   \n \n7 The word  \u201cclaim \u201d as it is used when discussing the doctrine of claim preclusion refers to \na cause of action, not a patent claim.  Following the Federal Circuit \u2019s practice, I will avoid \nambiguity wherever possible by reserving the term \u201c claim \u201d for patent claims and referring to \n\u201ccause of action\u201d when discussing claim preclusion.    \n \n8 \n 1. Aspex  and Senju  \nIn Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Marchon Eyewear, Inc. , 672 F.3d 1335, 1339 \u201341 (Fed. Cir. \n2012),  the Federal Circuit hel d that claim preclusion c an bar a patentee from asserting the same \npatent in a  second suit against the same defendant , even if the claims asserted in the second suit  \ndid not exist  in the same form when t he patentee filed the prior s uit.  In that case, the patentee had \nasserted the same patent against the defendant s in prior action s that resulted in final judgment s.  \nId. at 13 38\u201339.  The patentee subsequently obtained amended claims as the result of an inter partes  \nreexamination initiated by a third party , and the patentee then sued the defendant s a second time \nfor infringing the new claims.  Id.  at 1339\u201340.  The defendant s argued that the second suit was \nbarre d by claim preclusion, but the patentee contended that , because th e new claims did not  exist \nwhen  the prior actions  were filed, those new claims created new causes of action.   \nThe Federal Circuit agreed  with the defendants .  It held that  even though the new claims \ncould not have been asserted in the original action s, they did not  qualify as a new cause of action \nbecause they were \u201cnot materially different\u201d from  other  claims  that were previously availabl e.  Id. \nat 1341\u201342; see also id. at 1341 ( \u201cWe agr ee with the district court that the changes made to claim \n23 in reexamination we re insubstantial .\u201d).  The Federal Circuit observed  that, while the amended \nclaims  contained additional limitations not in the original claims,  two of  those additional \nlimitations  were already implicit in the original claims and another was \u201c insignificant \u201d because it \n\u201cnarrow[ed] the scope of the claim in a way that d[id] not affect the products . . . at issue.\u201d   Id.  \nThe court further pointed out that , because the new cl aims that emerged from the reexamination \nwere, by statute, required to be narrower than t he original claims , they \u201cdid not create a new legal \nright against infringement  that [the patentee] lacked under the original version of the patent\u201d  and, \nthus, \u201cd[id] not create a new cause of action that did not exist before.\u201d   Id.    \n \n9 \n The Aspex case left some open questions.  For example, was the  court\u2019s holding that claim \npreclusion bars assertion of claims that hadn\u2019t issued at the time of the original action  limited to  \ncases where the new claims are \u201cnot materially different\u201d from  claims that could have be en \nasserted in the original action ?  That question was answered two years later in Senju Pharm. Co. \nv. Apotex Inc. , 746 F.3d 1344, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Like this case, Senju was an ANDA case.  \nAfter the defendant (Apotex) filed an ANDA for approval to m arket a generic version of the \npatentee\u2019s branded ophthalmic solution, the patentee sued the defendant for patent infringement in \ndistrict court.  Th e court hel d a bench trial and concluded that the defendant \u2019s product  infringed \nsome of the asserted claims  but that all the asserted claims were invalid as obvious over the prior \nart.  Id.  at 1347.  After the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law , but \nbefore it entered final judgment , the p atentee filed a request with the PTO  for re examination of its \nown patent.  The PTO granted reexamination, and the patentee amended one of the claims  that the \ndistrict court had previously found obvious .  The patentee amended the claim  to add several \nlimitations  that presumably avoided the prior art that rendered the original claim s invalid , \nincluding limitations directed to the pH and the amounts of two ingredients.  Id.  at 1347, 1350.   \nThe patentee also cancelled several claims and obtained several other new claims.  After the \nissuance of the new  claims, but still prior to the dis trict court\u2019s final judgment in the f irst action, \nthe patentee filed a new case asserting the new claims against the defendant.   Then, when t he \ndistrict court entered final judgment in the first case , the defendant sought to have the second case \ndismissed on the basis of claim preclusion.  The district court agreed and dismissed the second \nsuit.   \nA split panel of the  Federal Circuit affirmed.   For starters , the majority r eiterated  Aspex \u2019s \nholding that \u201cclaims that emerge from reexamination do not in and of  themselves create a new 10 cause of action that did not exist before.\u201d  Id. at 1352.  The court next addressed  the patentee\u2019s \nattempt to distinguish Aspex on the basis that the amended claims in that  case \u201cwere not materially \ndifferent\u201d  from original claims  that could have been asserted in the first suit.   Id. at 1353.  The \nSenju patentee argued that claim preclusion d oes not bar a second suit  unless the district court \ncompares the new claims  with the original claims and makes a \u201cdetail[ed]\u201d factual determin ation \nthat they are not materially different.  Id . at 1352.  According to the patentee, because the question \nof whether claims are \u201cmaterially different\u201d is a factual determination , the district court erred by \ndismissing the second suit at the motion to di smiss stage.  \nThe Federal Circuit panel  rejected that argument.   It observed that, pursuant to the statute s \ngoverning reexamination, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 132(a), 305 a reexamined patent claim cannot be broader  \nthan the original claim, so it  \u201ccannot contain within its scope any product or process which would \nnot have infringed the original claims .\u201d  Id. at 1352.  In other words, if the defendant infringes the  \nreexamined  claims  asserted  in the second suit , the defendant \u2019s same acts  would have also infringed \nthe patentee\u2019s original c laims .  Id. at 13 52\u201353 (\u201c[B]ecause the patent right is a right to exclude \nwhose outer boundary is defined by the scope of the patent\u2019s claims , . . . reexamination does not \nprovide larger claim scope to the patentee than the patentee had under the original patent claims.\u201d ).  \nThe court f urther observed that , \u201c[b]oth in Aspex  and in [ Senju] the district court could \nreadily ascertain that the reexamined claims were essentially the original claims with the addition \nof limitations designed to avoid prior art.  I n Aspex, the appellate court noted  that fact; in [ Senju] \nthe trial court noted that the amended and new claims were essentially the original claims with limiting words added.\u201d  Id. at 1354.  Because the reexamin ed claims asserted in the second suit \nfell strictly within the scope of origina l claims  that the patentee could have asserted in the first suit , ,   \n \n11 \n the reexamin ed claims did not \u201c create a new cause of action \u201d for purposes of claim preclusion.  Id. \nat 1353.   \nPerhaps  because it recogni zed that it had nev er opined on the precise scope of what \nreexamination amendments are forbidden by  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 305, the Senju majority  stopped short of \npronouncing a bright line rule that claims issued during reexamination can never  create a new \ncause of act ion.  It stated:  \nWhether it is possible that a reexamination could ever result in the \nissuance of new patent claims that were so materially different from the original patent claims as to create a new cause of action, but at the same time were sufficiently  narrow so as not to violate the rule \nagainst reexamined claims being broader than the original claims, is a question about which we need not opine \u2014that is not the case \nbefore us.  We hold that, in the absence of a clear showing that such \na material differ ence in fact exi sts in a disputed patentable \nreexamination claim, it can be assumed that the reexamined claims will be a subset of the original claims and that no new cause of action will be created. This applies whether the judgment in the original suit w as based on inva lidity of the claims or simply on non-\ninfringement.  \n \nId. at 1354.  Because the reexamin ed claims at issue in Senju were a \u201csubset\u201d of original claims \nthat could have been asserted in the first suit, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ndismiss al of the patentee\u2019 s second suit .  It did so notwithstanding that  the added  limitations might \nhave changed the outcome \u2014the patentee\u2019s  first suit found that the  defendant infringed some of \nthe original claims but all the original asserted  claims were obviou s; the reexamin ed claims  \nasserted in the second suit  contained additional limitations that might have  made them  nonobvious . \n Judge O\u2019Malley dissented.  Among other things, s he argued that \u201c[i]f reexamination did, \nin fact, create rights  that did not exist i n time for [the patentee] to assert them in the first action \nagainst [the defendant] , claim preclusion should not prevent [the patentee] from asserting its new  \nrights\u201d and that \u201c[t]o rule otherwise would fault [the patentee] for failing to raise claims tha t did    \n \n12 \n not exist.\u201d  Id. at 1354 (O\u2019Malley, J., dissenting) .  Judge O\u2019Malley also responded to the majority\u2019s \nsuggestion that claim preclusion bars a second suit asserting reexamination claims absent \u201c a clear \nshowing that . . . a material difference in fact exists\u201d  between the original and reexamined claims , \nstating,  \n[t]he  basis for requiring this heightened showing or placing the \nburden on the patentee  is unclear. Because the majority has \ndetermined that Senju has not shown such a material difference here, \nmoreover \u2014where Senju's reexamined claims are presumptively \nvalid and its original claims have been ruled invalid\u2014it is difficult to imagine how a par ty could meet the heightened requirement that \nthe majority imposes today.  \nId. at 1356 n.2 (O\u2019Malley, J., di ssenting) . \n2. Application of Aspex  and Senju to this case  \nApplying the principles set forth in Aspex  and Senju , I conclude that the doctrine of claim \npreclusion bars Sanofi  from asserting the \u02bc592 patent in this case .  There is no dispute that t he new  \n\u02bc592 patent  claims Sanofi obtained from the IPR proceeding are essentially  original  patent  claims \nwith at least two additional limitations \u2014limitations  the PTAB did not find pro ven to be in the \nprior art.   Mylan Labs. Ltd., 2017 WL 4221400,  at *29; D.I. 255 at 2, 9.  If Defendants infringe \nthe new claims , they would also have infringed the original claims .  Because t he ne w claims are a  \n\u201csubset \u201d of original claims , \u201cno new cause of action [was] created\u201d by their issuance.  Senju, 746 \nF.3d at 1353.  \nSanofi does not dispute  that the amended claims asserted in this case are subsets of  some \nof the original claims of the \u02bc 592 patent.  (D.I. 255 at 9.)  However, Sanofi argues that the amended \nclaims are not barred by claim preclusion because they are broader in some ways than the claims \naddressed in the New Jersey c ourt\u2019s prior opinion.  See Sanofi I , 2018 WL 9364037, at *35.  That    \n \n13 \n is because the broadest original claims, such as independent claim 1, were not asserted  at trial.8  \nSee id.   I reject that argument.  The application of claim preclusion does not turn on what claims \nwere actual ly asserted in the prior case.   What matters is what could have been asserted in the prior \ncase.  Aspex , 672 F.3d at 1338, 1341\u201342.  There is no dispute that Sanofi could have tried  original \nclaims 27\u201329, from which its new asserted claims derive, in the previous case.   \nSanofi next argues th at dismissal is inappropriate because  it has plausibly alleg ed that \u201cthe \namended claims are materially different from the original claims.\u201d  (D.I. 255 at 9\u201310.)   Sanofi \npoints out , for example, that the PTAB has found that Sanofi\u2019s  addition of the new limitation s \nresulted in a  finding of patentability  over the prior art .  (Id.)  In Senju, however, the Federal Circuit \naffirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal notwithstanding the patentee\u2019s contention that the amended \nclaims were materially different than the original claims because the amended claims contained \nlimitations that avoided the prior art.  Senju  says if the new claims are a subset of the original \nclaims, they are the same cause of action.  The Senju majority was also clear that claim preclusion \napplies even when \u201cthe judgment in the original suit was based on invalidity of the claims .\u201d  746 \nF.3d at 1353.9    \n \n8 The claims subject to the final judgement had more precise dosage limitations than the \namended claims \u2014for example original claim 21 requires doses of exactly 20 mg/m2 whereas \noriginal claim 1, and two of the amended claims, allow a range of doses from 20 to 25 mg/m2.  \n(D.I. 248, Ex. A at 20\u201323.)  \n9 Sanofi attempts to distinguish Senju on the basis that the new claims  obtained by the \npatentee in that case were  in fact obvious, as demonstrated by the fact that a district court so \nconcluded in a different action.  According to Sanofi, this  case is different because the PTAB found \nin the IPR that Mylan failed to prove Sanofi\u2019s  amended claims were obvious , and the Federal \nCircuit affirmed .  The  main  problem with Sanofi\u2019s argument is that the Federal Circuit\u2019s major ity \ndecision in Senju did not turn on the question of whether the new claims were  in fact obvious.  It \nturned on whether  the new claims were a subset of the original claims.     \n \n14 \n It is true, as Sanofi points out, that Senju declined to adopt a bright line rule that all \n\u201cnarrower\u201d claims issuing out of reexamination proceedings are the same cause of action as the \noriginal c laims.  But I agree with defendants that the Federal Circuit\u2019s theoretical observation  in \nSenju that it may be possible to obtain a claim in reexamination that creates a new cause of action \ndoes not pr event dismissal here.  In Senju, the court held that th e new claims were the same cause \nof action when they were essentially  the original claims with additional  limitations .  That is the \nsituation here.10   \nSanofi is correct that Senju  concerned new claims obtained through reexamination, while \nSanofi obtained its new claims from an IPR proceeding.  But Sanofi has not persuasively explained why any differences between reexamination and IPR proceedings are relevant to the claim preclusion analysis.  Sanofi poi nts out, for example, that depositions are available f or an IPR but \nnot for a reexamination.  But what difference does that make to the question of whether the new claims are a subset of the original claims?  The Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in Senju did not  turn on \nthe availability of discovery.  It turned on the circumstance that  reexamination proceedings do not \n \n10 Sanofi tries to distinguish Senju and Aspex  on the basis that \u201c the three -compone nt \npremedication required by [Sanofi\u2019s] amended claims does not represent the mere addition of \nwords that narrow existing aspects of the claims or make implicit limitations explicit.  Rather, the three- component premedication is a distinct aspect of the in vention disclosed in the \u02bc592 patent \nthat was not previously claimed.\u201d  (D.I. 255 at 10.)   I reject that argument .  For one thing, I  am \nunaware of any doctrine of patent law that distinguishes between \u201cclaim limitations\u201d and \u201cclaim aspects,\u201d and Sanofi doe s not cite any  cases making that distinction.  Moreover, I don\u2019t read  Senju  \nto be re stricted to situations in which \u201cwor ds\u201d were added to existing limitations.  Rather, Senju \nsays that claim preclusion should apply when the amended  claims cover a subset of  the scope \ncovered by an original  claim.  \n In support of its position that dismissal is inappropriate, Sanofi also quotes dictum from \nCardpool, Inc. v. Plastic Jungle, Inc., 817 F.3d 1316, 1323\u201324 (Fed. Cir. 2016), but that case \nmerely held that a district court properly declined  to advise on the future application of res judicata \nto reexamined claims in the context of \u201ca case that the parties agreed was moot\u201d because the \ndefendant had stopped the accused conduct.      \n \n15 \n result in a new patent , and that the  claims in that case were, consistent with the rules governing \namendments, a subset of the original claims.  Like reexami nation proceedings, amendments during \nIPR proceedings do not result in the issue of a new patent, nor may IPR claim amendments enlarge \nthe scope of the claims or introduce new matter .  35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 316(d)(3), 318(b).  I also reject \nSanofi\u2019s argument that di smissal is inappropriate because the precise question of how claim \npreclusion applies to claims issued during IPR proceedings is \u201cone of first impression.\u201d  (D.I. 255 \nat 6.)  Senju  was resolved at the motion to dismiss stage, and  similarly in this case discovery would \nnot affec t the conclusion that the new claims are subset s of the original claims.11 \nSanofi contends that preventing a  patent holder from suing on a previously litigated patent \nwith new claims it obtained in a  IPR \u201cwould undermine the IPR framework\u201d and would be \n\u201cparticularly prejudicial  to owners of Orange Book- listed patents.\u201d  (D.I. 255 at 12\u201313.)  It  points \nout that  if a defendant who filed an ANDA initiates an IPR , if the district court hearing  the first  \nANDA cases declines to stay  pending that  IPR, and  if the dist rict court case reaches  final judgment \n \n11 Sanofi cites cases discussing how the doctrine of claim preclusion applies to subsequent \nsuits involving continuation patents.  See, e.g.,  SimpleAir, 884 F.3d at 1164; Purdue Pharma L.P. \nv. Mylan Pharms. Inc., No. 15- 1155, 2017 WL 784989, at *9 (D. Del. Mar. 1, 2017), adopted, \n2017 WL 2569604 (June 13, 2017).  Those cases are distinguishable because, among other reasons, \ncontinuation patents are distinct patents that may include claims with broader or different scope.  \nSee SimpleAir , 884 F.3d at 1166\u201369.   \n Sanofi cites Target Training Int \u2019l, Ltd. v. Exte nded Disc N. Am., Inc., 645 F. App\u2019x 1018, \n1025\u201326 (Fed. Cir. 2016), but that case is distinguishable because there was no prior judgment on \nthe merits.  Id.  at 1025.   \n Sanofi also cites Gillig v. Nike, Inc. , 602 F.3d 1354, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2010) , and Lawl or v. \nNat\u2019l Screen Serv. Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 328 (1955) , for the proposition that claim preclusion does \nnot bar the assertion of rights that did not exist when the original suit was filed.   Both cases involved new causes of action  that arose from factual events  that occurred after earlier suits were \nfiled.  N either of those cases involved the infringement of the same patent by the same acts litigated \nin a prior suit.  Senju says that claim preclusion can bar a later suit even if the asserted patent \nclaims did not e xist at the time of the first suit.  \n    \n \n16 \n before amended claims issue out of the  IPR, then the patentee\u2019s amended claims can only be \nasserted against ANDA filers who did not participate in the first round of litigation.  ( Id.)  Sanofi \nis correct that th is may be the result in some cases  and that an ANDA filer named  in the first suit \nwill be free to sell its  generic version even though it might be infringing valid amended claims .  \nImporta ntly, however, that will only be the result  if the ANDA filer wins  a final  judgment in the \nfirst case.   Any prejudice to the patentee  in that situation  is counterbalanced by prejudice to the \nANDA filer from having to defend the same conduct against the same patent twice.   And a ny \nprejudice to the patentee is of its  own making, a s it could have filed for the amended  claims during \nthe original prosecution of the patent  or sought reexamination before filing the first litigation.  \nSanofi says that applying the doctrine of claim precl usion to bar assertion  of amended \nclaims obtained during an IPR is not necessary to prevent gamesmanship  by patentees  because \nIPR proceedings cannot be initiated by a patentee.  It also points out that it sought to avoid this \nsituation by requesting a stay of the New Jersey cases  pending the IP R.  If Sanofi \u2019s contention is \nthat claim preclusion should be restricted to cases where the patentee put its own patent into \nadministrative proceedings to attempt a  \u201cdo-over\u201d after an adverse  judgment , I reject that \nargument.  In Aspex, the Federal  Circuit held that claim preclusion barred the assertion of claims \nissued from a reexamination in a subsequent litigation, even though the reexamination was initiated by a third party.  672 F.3d at 1339.  \n Sanofi\u2019s arguments are not without force.  Before Senju, they might have  had a chance of \nwinning.  But the Senju  majority  rejected similar  arguments , and I see no principled basis on which \nto distinguish this case.  Accordingly, I recommend that the Court dis miss Sanofi\u2019s \u02bc592 patent \ncauses of action  against Apotex and Sandoz  (Counts V and V I).    \n \n17 \n B. \u02bc110 and \u02bc777 patents  \nDefendants also argue that the Court should dismiss Sanofi\u2019s allegations of  infringement \nof the \u02bc110 and \u02bc777 patent s.  As noted above, t he parties have already been litigating those patents \nin this ca se for two years.   The parties have already proceeded through discovery, and the Court \nhas already construed the asserted claims.  The allegations in Sanofi\u2019s pleadings rega rding those \ntwo patents have not materially changed.  But w hen Sanofi amended its p leadings to include claims \nfor infringement of the \u02bc592 patent , Defendants seized on an opportunity to try to get the counts  \ninvolving the \u02bc110 and \u02bc777 patents dismissed.   I recommend that the Court deny Defendants\u2019 \nrequest.  \nThe SAC  alleges that Defendants\u2019 ANDA  and (b)(2) N DA products will induce \ninfringement of the \u02bc110 and \u02bc777 patent s.  Section 271(b) of Title 35 provides that \u201c[w]hoever  \nactively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.\u201d  To state a claim of \ninduced infringement under \u00a7 271(b), the  complaint must plausibly allege that (1) there has been \ndirect infringement, (2) the defendant knowingly induced infri ngement, and (3) the defendant \npossessed the intent to encourage another\u2019s infringement. MEMC Elec. Materials, Inc. v. \nMitsubishi Materia ls Silicon Corp., 420 F.3d 1369, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n271(e)(2), an ANDA or (b)(2) NDA applicant i s liable for inducing infringement of a method \npatent if its label would actively encourage a patented use.  Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Lupin, \nLtd., 676 F.3d 1316, 1319, 1321\u201322 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, I nc., 7 F.4th 1320, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  \nDefendants contend  that their proposed labels will not encourage infringement of  asserted \nclaim s of the \u02bc 110 and \u02bc777 patents , which cover \u201cmethod[s] of increasing survival\u201d in patients \nwith castration -resistant me tastatic prostate cancer that has progressed during or after treatment    \n \n18 \n with docetaxel .12  In particular, Defendants  point out that Judge Andrews ha s already construed \nthe \u201cmethod of increasing survival\u201d  preamble of the asserted claims to require \u201cthe intentional \npurpose of increasing . . . survival in an individual patient  in need of . . . increasing survival .\u201d  (D.I. \n215.)  Defendants argue that the ir proposed labels do not encourage doctors to form the  intent to \nadminister the  products  with the purpose of increasing survival. \nI agree with Sanofi that it has plausibly alleged  that Defendan ts\u2019 proposed labels encourage \nphysicians to prescribe  their products with the intent of increasing survival .  Defendants \u2019 proposed \nlabels tell physicians that the ir products are indicated \u201c for treatment of patients with metastatic \ncastration -resistant prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel -contain ing treatment \nregimen .\u201d  (SAC \u00b6 92, Ex. D  \u00a7 1.)  T he proposed labels al so describe the results of a clinical study \nthat found a decrease in the number of  deaths and  an increase in the median survival time  when \nsuch patients were treated with cabazitaxel as  opposed to another treatment regimen.  (SAC \u00b6 92, \nEx. D \u00a7 14.)   At this stage of the case, i t is plausible that a physician reading those label s will be \nencouraged to administer Defendants\u2019 proposed products to a patient with the intent of increasing \n \n12 Independent claim 1 of the \u02bc 110 patent recites: \u201c1. A method of increasing survival \ncomprising administering to a patient in need thereof (1) cabazitaxel, or a hydrate of solvate \nthereof, as a new cycle every three we eks and (2) dexchlorpheniramine adminis tered at a dose of \n5 mg, dexamethasone administered at a dose of 8 mg, and an H2 antagonist, each administered prior to the administration of said cabazitaxel, or hydrate of solvate thereof, wherein said patient has castration resistant metastatic prostate  cancer that has progressed during or after treatment with \ndocetaxel. \u201d   \nIndependent claim 1 of the \u02bc777 patent recites: \u201c 1. A method of increasing survival \ncomprising administering to a patient in need thereof a dose of 20 to 25 mg/m\n2 of cabazitaxel, or \na hydrate or solvate thereof, in combination with an H 2 antagonist, wherei n the H 2 antagonist is \nadministered to the patient prior to administering the dose of cabazitaxel, and wherein said patient has castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed during or after treatment with docetaxel. \u201d    \n \n19 \n the patient\u2019s survival.  Defendants are free at a later stage of the case to make whatever arguments \nthey want about how physicians will interpret their proposed labels. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated  above , Defendants \u2019 motion should be GRANTED -IN-PART and \nDENIED -IN-PART:  \n1.
