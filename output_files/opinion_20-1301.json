And whether a n official\u2019s  response is \nreasonable  depends on what th at official knew about the threat.   \n \n2 \n Delaware  prisoners say various officials were deliberately indifferent to the \nCOVID -19 pandemic. But most of th em responded reasonably : they mandate d \nwearing mask s, provided masks, quarantined sick prisoners , and screened visitors. \nYet the warden  did not. Though he allegedly knew that prison officers were flouting \nthe mask mandate a nd punishing prisoners  for making their own masks, he failed to \nintervene. So I dismiss all but one of the prisoners \u2019 claims.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn this motion to dismiss, I take the complaint\u2019s well- pleaded factual allegations \nas true. In March 2020 , prisoners  at Delaware\u2019s Sussex Correctional Institute learned \nthat COVID was dangerous . Am. Compl., D.I. 695 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36. Worried, they asked for \nmasks, more cleaning supplies, and better disinfecting procedures. Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201338. At \nfirst, those requests were denied . Id. \u00b6 39. So prisoners protested and made their own \nprotective gear. O ne \u201cfashioned and wore  makeshift face  masks out of a T -shirt and \ntowel.\u201d Id. \u00b6 48. He was fired from his job and consigned to solitary confinement. Id.  \nBy April , Delaware had begun to respond. It ordered some employees to \u201cstay \nhome from work .\u201d Id. \u00b6 49. And a month later , it mandated masks for staff, though \nsome  officers flouted the rule . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 50\u201354. It also  placed Sussex on \u201clockdown .\u201d Id. \n\u00b6 54. Plus, by  July, Delaware  had mandated masks for prisoners and begun testing \nparticularly sick patients for COVID . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59. It eventually made tests available \nto all prisoners. Id. \u00b6 68. \nStill, t he pandemic hit Sussex hard. Cramped conditions meant that prisoners  \ncould not social ly distance. Id. \u00b6 71(c). In one unit, more than half the prisoners  \ncontracted COVID. Id.  \u00b6 64. A nd at least two died. Id.  \u00b6 72.  \n \n3 \n To make matters worse, COVID tore through the prison\u2019s staff too.  Id. \u00b6 65. Nurses \nfell ill and missed shifts. So \u201csick calls backed up.\u201d Id.  (internal quotation marks \nomitted) . Some prisoners waited six weeks for treatment. Id. \u00b6 66. Others with severe \nsymptoms waited days to be taken  to a hospital. Id. \u00b6 71(g). And some prisoners were \nput on ventilators , then left unmonitored. Id.  \u00b6 71(f). Throughout it all, the prison \nkept charg ing prisoners $4 for each sick call. Id.  \u00b6 28. \nPrisoners at  Sussex  say the se conditions violated their  state and federal  right s to \nbe free from cruel and unusual punishment. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 87\u201398. By failing to adequately \nrespond to the pandemic, they  say, Defendants were deliberately indifferent to \nCOVID \u2019s danger. So t hey filed this class action against the Delaware Department of  \nCorrection, its Commissioners, the Sussex Warden, and the Governor of Delaware. \nThey  seek damages and injunctive relief.  Defendants have moved to dismiss.  D.I. 702.  \nSo I ask whether  the prisoners\u2019 \u201ccomplaint \u2026 contain [s] sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a [plausible] claim to relief.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nII. THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT BARS SOME OF THE PRISONERS \u2019 CLAIM S \nA. Claims against the Delaware Department of Correction  \nThe prisoners  cannot sue the state Department of Correction in federal court. A \nstate is immune in federal court unless it waives its Eleventh Amendment i mmunity . \nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon , 473 U.S. 234, 238 (1985),  abrogated on other \ngrounds by statute. Our test for finding a waiver is \u201cstringent.\u201d Id.  at 241 . Thus, a \nstate \u2019s \u201cgeneral waiver of sovereign immunity \u2026 is not enough to waive\u201d its Eleventh  \n \n4 \n Amendment immunity. Id.  Instead, the state \u201cmust specify [its] intention to subject \nitself to suit in federal court .\u201d Id. \nThe prisoners  point to a Delaware statute that waives sovereign immunity for \nclaims  against the state that are  covered by  insurance. Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, \u00a76511. \nBut that statute is only a \u201cgeneral waiver of sovereign immunity .\u201d Atascadero , 473 \nU.S. at 241. It does not suffice because it does not spe cifically waive Delaware\u2019s \nimmunity in federal court . See Ospina v. Dep\u2019 t of Corr. , 749 F. Supp. 572, 579 (D. Del. \n1990); Kardon v. Hall , 406 F. Supp. 4, 8 \u20139 (D. Del. 1975).  \nDelaware has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.  And the \nDepartment is \u201cclearly a state agency.\u201d Murphy v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc. , 2005 WL \n2155226, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 19, 2005). So the prisoners  cannot sue it.  I thus \ndismiss their claims against the Department with prejudice.  \nB. State c onstitut ional claim s \nThe prisoners also claim that  the Defendants  violated Delaware\u2019s Constitution. \nD.I. 695 \u00b6\u00b6  99\u2013103. But the Eleventh Amendment bars state -law claims against state \nofficials when \u201cthe relief sought \u2026 directly \u2026 [affects] the State itself.\u201d  Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman , 465 U.S. 89, 117 (1984) . And the prisoners\u2019  \nrequested relief would. They  ask for \u201cunlimited\u201d masks, \u201clong -term medical \nmonitoring\u201d and other improvements to Delaware\u2019s pandemic response. D.I. 695 \n\u00b6 113. So I dismiss this claim  with prejudice  as well . \n \n  \n \n5 \n III. MOST OF THE PRISONERS \u2019 REMAINING CLAIMS ALSO FAIL \nThat leaves only the prisoners\u2019 Eighth Amendment claim under 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1983, \nseeking  both damages and injunctive relief. They  may not sue for damages . But their  \nclaim for injunctive relief survives \u2014though only against Warden Mears.  \nA. The prisoners  may not sue the state officials for damages  \nThe prisoners  cannot get damages under \u00a7  1983 because they sue the state officials \nin their official capacities. D.I. 695  \u00b6 95. Section 1983 authorizes suits only against \n\u201cpersons.\u201d  Will v. Mich . Dep\u2019t of State Police , 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).  But \u201cstate officials \nacting in their official capacities are not \u2018persons\u2019 under \u00a7  1983.\u201d Blanciak v. Allegheny \nLudlum Corp. , 77 F.3d 690, 697 (3d Cir. 1996)  (citing Will, 491 U.S. at 71) . That is \nbecause such claims count \u201cnot [as] a suit against the official  but rather [as] a suit \nagainst the official\u2019s office.\u201d  Will, 491 U.S. at 71. So I dismiss with prejudice the \nprisoners\u2019 Eighth Amendment  damages claim  against the state official s in their \nofficial capacities . \nB. Only the prisoners\u2019  claim against Warden Mears survives  \nInjunctions are another matter. When sued for injunctions , state officials count as \npersons under \u00a7  1983. Will, 491 U.S. at 71 n.10. So I turn to the merits . \nTo win, the prisoners  must plausibly plead that each  official  was deliberately \nindifferent and that each was personally involved  in that constitutional violation.  \nChavarriaga v. N.J. Dep't of Corr. , 806 F.3d 210, 222 (3d Cir. 2015)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted) . The only official who checks both boxes is Warden Mears.   \n \n6 \n 1. Apart from the warden, none of the officials was deliberately \nindifferent to COVID  \n\u201cThe Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons \u2026 but neither does it \npermit inhumane ones.\u201d  Farmer v. Brennan , 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Thus, under the Eighth Amendment, prison officials must \ngive prisoners \u201cadequate \u2026 medical care.\u201d Id. But o fficials are liable for failing to do \nso only if: (1) prison conditions pose a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d to prisoner s \nand (2) officials were deliberately indifferent to that risk . Id. at 834.  Though the risk \nwas serious and the officials knew of it, there is no plausible allegation that most of \nthem deliberately disregarded it.  \na. Substantial risk of serious harm . The prisoners  meet the first, objective  prong . \nSee, e.g. , Swain v. Junior , 961 F.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir. 2020) (holding that COVID \nsatisfies the serious- harm prong). COVID threatened prisoners\u2019 health. Many fell ill. \nD.I. 695 \u00b6\u00b6  57\u201358, 64. Some needed IV fluids, CPR, or a ventilator . Id. \u00b6 71. A t least \ntwo prisoners died.  Id. \u00b6 72. So I turn to the second, subjective showing.   \nb. Deliberate indifference. The prisoners must also adequately plead the officials \nhad a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind .\u201d Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Since this is a prison -conditions case, they must  satisfy \nthis prong by pleading that the officials were \u201cdeliberate[ly] indifferen[t] to inmate \nhealth or safety.\u201d Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted) . This subjective prong \nrequires two showing s: (1) that each defendant knew  that COVID posed  a serious risk \nof harm and  (2) that they disregarded \u201cthat risk by failing to take reasonable  \n \n7 \n measures\u201d to address  it. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844, 847. Officials need ensure only \n\u201creasonable safety.\u201d Id.  at 844 (internal quotation marks omitted). And they are not \nliable just because  \u201cthe harm ultimately was not averted.\u201d Id.  \nThe officials appear to concede the first sub -issue : they subjectively knew COVID \nwas dangerous. Instead, they  dispute  the second. They say  they did not disregard the \nrisk COVID posed , but  took reasonable measures to combat it . In support, they  ask \nthat I consider their publicly  available COVID policies , and the prisoners do not \nobject . I will do so.  Sands v. McCormick , 502 F.3d 263, 268 (3d Cir. 2007) ( letting  \ndistrict court s consider \u201cmatters of public record\u201d when deciding motions to dismiss).  \nDelaware  began screening prisoners for COVID in January 2020. By April, it had \nstarted screening staff, isolating all incoming prisoners for 14 days, using new \nsanitizing machines, holding disinfection trainings, manufacturing masks,  testing \nsick prisoners,  and tracing  infections . How the  Delaware Department of Correction I s \nContaining COVID -19 at 2 \u20133 (June 3, 2020), \nhttps://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/How the Delaware DOC is cont aining\nCOVID19.pdf . By June, half the prisoners had masks. Id.  at 3. B y December , the state  \nwas reviewing sick calls daily, triaging them , and following CDC quarantine \nguidelines. COVID -19 Frequently Asked Questions, at 1 \u20132 (Dec. 2020),  \nhttps://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/COVID- 19 FAQ.pdf . It was also \nscreening visitors for COVID and had given every prisoner two cloth masks. And by \nyear\u2019s end, it had given near ly 10,000 COVID tests to staff and prisoners. Id. at 5\u20136.  \n \n8 \n By June 2021, the Department of Correction had mandated that each prison have \nits own \u201csite specific infection/exposure control plan.\u201d Policy of State of Delaware \nDepartment of Correction B -02, at 2  (June 4, 2021), \nhttps://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/policies/policy 11 -B-02.pdf . Each plan \nhad to  be reviewed and updated annually , and each  had to  meet  certain minimum \nrequirements. Id. For instance, each  plan had to  \u201cfollow the guidelines and \nrecommendations of\u201d the CDC, OSHA , and other prison -specific organizations . Id. \nAnd each  had to  mandate medical -grade masks in medical settings , vaccines for all \nconsenting prisoners, and quarantine for sick prisoners.  Id. at 3\u20136. \ni. Commissioner DeMatteis responded reasonably.  As the head of Delaware\u2019s \nDepartment of Correction, DeMatteis  was responsible for the Department\u2019s  \n\u201coversight [and] operation\u201d  until 2021.  D.I. 695 \u00b6 17 (citing  Del. C ode Ann. tit. 11, \n\u00a7\u00a7 6516, 6517). Thus, she took part in  many , if not all, of the Department\u2019s early \nCOVID measures. Most of the prisoners\u2019 complaints stem from DeMatteis\u2019s tenure, \nespecially the pandemic\u2019s first six months. But DeMattei s reasonably tried to protect \nprisoners from COVID. So she cannot  be held liable . See Farmer , 511 U.S. at  845. \nCOVID posed an unprecedented challenge for prison officials. Yet  DeMatteis\u2019s  \nDepartment began implementing COVID precautions as early as January 2020 and \nkept honing its response through the end of her  tenure.  \nPushing back,  the prisoners  point to Sussex\u2019s  quarantine procedures  as a n \nexample . D.I. 712, at 9. Specifically, t hey note Sussex\u2019s practice of putting all \n\u201cCOVID -positive inmates  into\u201d a single overcrowded building.  Id. But they never  \n \n9 \n plead facts that show th is response  was unreasonable. Were there other, empty \nbuildings available for COVID patients? Did other prisons in Delaware create new \nfacilities for overflow , suggest ing that Sussex could have too? Without more,  having  \novercrowded quarantine centers during the pande mic\u2019s peak  was not  unreasonable.  \nNext, the prisoners  point to the Department\u2019s policy of charging prisoners for sick \ncalls and medical -grade masks. D.I. 712, at 10. But again, they  never plead facts \nshowing  that this practice is unreasonable under the Eigh th Amendment. Were \nprisoners denied treatment if they could not pay? Was the $4 sick -call fee more than \nmost could afford?  \nFinally, the prisoners  say DeMatteis was \u201caware of \u2026 officers\u2019 intention al refusal \nto properly wear masks,\u201d yet did nothing about it . D.I. 695 \u00b6  53. But they  plead no \nfacts that make this claim plausible. They  say only that prisoners  \u201csought to have the \nofficers wear the masks properly,\u201d but do not explain  how they did that. Id.  \u00b6 52. \nDeMatteis ran the state\u2019s whole prison system. I cannot assume that she knew about \nsome  unspecified amount of  rogue conduct at one prison. Thus, I dismiss the  claim \nagainst DeMatteis without prejudice.  \nii. Commissioner Hudson responded reasonably too . Hudson replaced DeMatteis  \nin 2021 , and t he prisoners  allege little from  his time as Commissioner. They  say only \nthat the Department provides cloth masks yet sells surgical ones and has failed to \n\u201crequire certain COVID -19-related trainings, and \u2026 provide adequate \nsoap/sanitizer/cleaning stations.\u201d Id.  \u00b6\u00b6 75, 77\u2013 78. And they  note that Sussex \npersonnel have ignored some COVID -safety suggestions from prisoners. Id. \u00b6 76.  \n \n10 \n Without more, I cannot say that these measures were unreasonable. Take masks . \nThe prisoners  say nothing of other facts  that would make the lack of free surgical \nmasks unreasonable : for instance, the current infection rate, the cost of the surgical \nmasks,  or any medical sources say ing such masks are necessary ( rather than \nsuggested) in these circumstances . Nor do t hey explain what trainings the \nDepartment should have offer ed. And they  plead no facts to show that the \nDepartment currently provides insufficient cleaning supplies , much les s that those \nare necessary to fight COVID . Finally, they  fail to explain what prisoner suggestions \nSussex ignored. So I dismiss their  claim against Hudson without prejudice.  \niii. Governor Carney responded reasonably as well.  The Governor responded \nreasonably for the same reason as the Commissioners : his Department of Correction \nresponded quickly  and vigorously  to the pandemic.  \nThe prisoners allege that Governor Carney knew prison guards were violating the \nmask mandate. Id.  \u00b6 53. If true, then Govern or Carney m ight have needed to do more  \nto enforce that policy. After all, what counts as a \u201creasonable measure\u201d naturally \ndepends on what the official knew. But the prisoners fail to plead any facts to  support \ntheir bald assertion that Governor Carney knew of these enforcement problems . \nWithout some facts to support the Governor\u2019s subjective knowledge, I cannot conclude that he plausibly knew about the  behavior of some prison guards  at one prison . \nBecause, on the facts pleaded, the Governor\u2019s res ponse was reasonable, I dismiss the \nclaim against him without prejudice.   \n \n11 \n iv. Warden Mears was deliberately indifferent.  Most of Warden Mears\u2019s COVID \nresponse was reasonable, b ut there are  two key difference s. First, Mears likely knew \nthat prison staff were defying the mask mandate : He oversaw day -to-day operations \nat Sussex  prison. D.I. 695 \u00b6  19. Plus, prisoners complained. Id. \u00b6 52. So at this early \nstage, one can plausibly infer that he knew.  Given that, he unreasonably failed to \nintervene  to enforce the mandate. Second, at least one of the prisoners under his care \nwas punished for fashioning and wearing a makeshift mask.  Forbidding  prisoners to \nprotect themselves against COVID may well have been  unreasonable as well . \n2. Personal involvement  \nSince the prisoners\u2019 claim against Warden Mears passe s the Eight h Amendment \nhurdle, I turn next to Mears\u2019s personal involvement. Under \u00a7  1983, they must \nadequately plead that Warden Mears was personally involved in the Eighth \nAmendment  violation.  Chavarriaga, 806 F.3d at  222. To meet this bar, the prisoners  \nneed allege only that Warden Mears had \u201cactual knowledge of and acquiescence in \nthe wrongful conduct.\u201d Id.  He does. \nThe prisoners  pleaded that Mears oversaw the prison. D.I. 695 \u00b6  19. Plus, they  \nsay, prisoners complained to staff. Id. \u00b6 52. And t hey claim  that staff brazenly violated \nthe mandate by hanging masks off their \u201cbreast -pocket button or  a belt loop.\u201d Id.  \u00b6 51. \nAccepting these allegations as true, I find it plausible to infer that Mears knew of and \nacquiesced in the officers\u2019 defiance. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nPlus, it is likely that Mears knew prisoners were being punished for making and \nwearing their own masks.  So the prisoners\u2019 claim s against Mears may proceed.   \n \n12 \n * * * * *  \nBecause the Eleventh Amendment  bars the prisoners\u2019 claim s against the \nDelaware Department of Correction and their state constitutional claims against all \nDefendants , I dismiss those claims with prejudice. I also dismiss with prejudice the \nprisoners\u2019 damages claims against the state officials in their official ca pacities. And I \ndismiss without prejudice the prisoners\u2019 claim for injunctive relief against DeMatteis, \nHudson, and Carney: on the facts that they plead, those officials responded \nreasonabl y. But the prisoners  have plausibly alleged that Warden Mears knew of the \nserious COVID risk yet was deliberately indifferent  to it. So the claim against him \nfor injunctive relief may proceed.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nDION D.
