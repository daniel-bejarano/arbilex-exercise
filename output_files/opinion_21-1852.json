(D.I. 20). The \nparties have fully briefed the issues. (D.I. 21, 22, 23). I heard oral argument on December 2, 2022. \n(D.I. 27, hereinafter \"Tr.\"). For the following reasons, I will GRANT Defendan t's motion with \nrespect to claim 1 of all three patents. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPictometry International Corp. and Eagle View Technologies , Inc. sued Roofr, Inc. for \ninfringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 10,648,800 (\"the '800 Patent\"), 9,183,538 (\"the '538 Patent\"), \nand 8,170,840 (\"the '840 Patent\"). (D.I. 12 at 1). \nEagle View, which was founded in 2008, was a pioneer in \"remote aerial roof measurement \nservice[s].\" (Id. at 2). Eagle View developed technology capable of producing \"extremely accurate \nand detailed roof reports using aerial imagery\" that \"were used to, among other things, estimate \nthe cost of roof repairs, construction , and insurance .\" (Id.). In 2013, Eagle View merged with \nPictometry-an \"innovator of ... aerial oblique image capture and processing technologies \"-and \nformed a new company, Eagle View Technolog y Corporation , which continues to develop aerial \nroof measurement products and which comprises Plaintiffs Eagle View and Pictometry. (Id.). I \nhereinafter refer to Plaintiffs collectively as \"Eagle View.\" \nThe asserted patents generally relate to aerial roof measurement. The '840 patent has been \nthe subject of prior decisions. In 2015, Eagle View brought a patent infringement action against \nunrelated Defendants Xactware Solutions and Verisk Analytics in the United States District Court \nfor the District of New Jersey. Eagle View Techs., Inc. v. Xactware Sols., Inc., 358 F. Supp. 3d \n399 (D.N.J. 2019) (hereinafter \"Xactware I\"). In that case, EagleView asserted six patents and \neleven claims, including claims 10 and 18 of the '840 patent. Id. at 402 n. 2. The Court denied \n2 Defendants ' \u00a7 101 challenge at the summary judgment stage, holding that the asserted claims were \ndirected to patent-eligible subject matter. Id. at 411. It did so again after trial, denying Defendants' \nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on the basis of\u00a7 101. Eagle View Techs., Inc. v. Xactware \nSols., Inc., 485 F. Supp. 3d 505 (D.N.J. 2020) (hereinafter \"Xactware II\"). The second decision \ninvolved five patents and six claims, including claim 10 of the '840 patent. Id. at 513. In 2021, \nEagle View asserted nine aerial roof measurement patents, including the '840 patent, against \nunrelated Defendant GAF Materials. Eagle View Techs. v. GAF Materials , LLC., No. 2:22-215-\nTS-DAO (D. Utah Dec. 12, 2022). The Court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss under\u00a7 101. \nId. at 8. The other two patents have not been litigated.1 \nWith respect the '800 patent, EagleView asserts \"at least claim 1\" (D.I. 12 at 25); with \nrespect to the '538 patent, it asserts \"claim 1 \", \"claims 6 and 7\", and \"at least claim 14\" (id. at 17-\n24); and with respect to the '840 patent, it asserts \"at least claim 1\" (id. at 12). Roofr argues that \nclaim 1 of each patent is representative. (D.I. 21 at 24-25). Eagle View disagrees. (D.I. 22 at 22-\n24). \nRoofr devotes roughly a page and a half of its 25-page opening brief to its representative \nclaim analysis. (See D.I. 21 at 24-25). The remainder of its briefing deals almost entirely with \nclaim 1 of each asserted patent. The asserted patents contain a total of 63 claims. I thus find Roofr' s \n1 Eagle View mentions that \"the asserted '800 patent is an indirect continuation of U.S. Patent No. \n8,542,880, which also survived a Section 101 challenge in the District ofNew Jersey.\" (D.I. 22 at \n1 ). But the survival was not a decision on the merits. Rather, the Court declined to undertake a \u00a7 \n101 analysis in light of ongoing claim construction disputes between the parties. (D .I. 22-1, Ex. A \nat 6). That decision therefore said nothing about the patent-eligibility of the '800 patent. \nThis is also true of EagleView Techs, Inc. v. Nearmap US, Inc., 2021 WL 5299729 (D. \nUtah Nov. 15, 2021), in which a court in the District of Utah denied another defendant's motion \nto dismiss on the basis of\u00a7 101. That decision did not involve any of the patents at issue here, nor \neven the predecessors of those patents. Id. at * 1. \n3 briefing insufficient to support a determination that claim 1 of each asserted patent is representati ve \nof all remaining claims in each asserted patent. \nI will therefore limit this opinion to deciding whether claim 1 of each asserted patent is \npatentable under\u00a7 101. \nClaim 1 of the '800 Patent recites: \n1. A process, comprising: \nreceiving first location data; \nproviding visual access to a first image corresponding to the first location \ndata, the first image including a roof structure of a building; \nproviding a first computer input capable of signaling a designation from a \nuser of a building roof structure location within the first image, wherein the \nbuilding roof structure location is a geographic position of the building roof \nstructure and is different than the first location data; \nreceive a designation of the building roof structure within the first image; \nresponsive to receiving the designation of the building roof structure \nlocation, providing a second computer input capable of signaling user\u00ad\nacceptance of the building roof structure location within the first image, \nwherein user-acceptance is one or more affirmative steps undertaken by the \nuser to confirm the designation of the building roof structure location; and \nsubsequent to receiving the user-acceptance confirming the designation of \nthe building roof structure location, providing a report for the building roof \nstructure. \nClaim 1 of the '538 patent recites: \n1. One or more non-transitory computer readable medium storing a set of computer \nexecutable instructions for running on one or more computer systems that when \nexecuted cause the one or more computer systems to: identify a geographic location \nof a roof; determine a footprint and predominant pitch of the roof by analyzing one \nor more image showing the roof; determine an estimated roofing area of the roof \nbased on the predominant pitch and the footprint of the roof; and generate a roof \nreport for determination of an amount of materials needed for a construction \nproject, wherein the roof report includes at least one image showing the roof and \nthe estimated roofing area of the roof. \n4 Claim 1 of the '840 patent recites: \n1. A computer-implemented method for generating a roof estimate report, the \nmethod comprising: \ndisplaying an aerial image of a building having a roof comprising a plurality \nof planar roof sections that each have a corresponding pitch; \ndisplaying a pitch determination marker operable to indicate pitch of a \nplanar roof section, wherein the pitch determination marker is overlaid on \nthe aerial image of the building having the roof; \nreceiving, based on the displayed pitch determination marker, an indication \nof the pitch of one of the plurality of planar roof sections of the roof of the \nbuilding; and \nmodifying a model of the roof based on the received indication of the pitch \nof the one planar roof section. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nPatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 is a threshold legal issue. Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. \n593, 602 (2010). Accordingly , the \u00a7 101 inquiry is properly raised at the pleading stage if it is \napparent from the face of the patent that the asserted claims are not directed to eligible subject \nmatter. See Cleveland Clinic Found v. True Health Diagnostics LLC, 859 F.3d 1352, 1360 (Fed. \nCir. 2017). The inquiry is appropriate at this stage \"only when there are no factual allegations that, \ntaken as true, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.\" Aatrix Software, Inc. \nv. Green Shades Software, Inc., 882 F.3d 1121, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nSection 101 of the Patent Act provides: \"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful \nprocess, machine, manufacture , or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement \nthereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\" 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court recognizes three categories of ineligible subject matter: laws of \nnature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int'/, 573 U.S. 208, \n216 (2014). The purpose of these exceptions is to protect the \"basic tools of scientific and \n5 technological work.\" Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Lab 'ys, Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 71 \n(2012). \nIn Alice, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the framework laid out in Mayo \"for distinguishing \npatents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena , and abstract ideas from those that claim \npatent-eligible applications of those concepts.\" 573 U.S. at 217. First, the court must determine \nwhether the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible concept. Id. \"The 'abstract ideas' category \nembodies 'the longstanding rule that an idea of itself is not patentable. \"' Id. ( quoting Gottschalk \nv. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972)). For software-implemented inventions , the step-one \ndetermination \"often turns on whether the claims focus on specific asserted improvements in \ncomputer capabilities or instead on a process or system that qualifies as an abstract idea for which \ncomputers are invoked merely as a tool.\" Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Zillow Grp., Inc., 50 F.4th \n1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citation omitted). I must \"articulate what the claims are directed to \nwith enough specificity to ensure the step one inquiry is meaningful. \" Thales Visionix Inc. v. \nUnited States, 850 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \nIf the claims fail step one, then the court must look to \"the elements of the claim both \nindividually and as an ordered combination \" to see if there is an \"inventive concept-i.e ., an \nelement or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts \nto significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\" Alice, 573 U.S. at 217-18 \n( cleaned up). \"A claim that recites an abstract idea must include additional features to ensure that \nthe claim is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the abstract idea.\" Id. at 221 \n( cleaned up). Further, \"the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas cannot be circumvented by \nattempting to limit the use of the idea to a particular technological environment. \" Id. at 222 \n( cleaned up) ( quoting Bilski, 561 U.S. at 610-11 ). Thus, \"the mere recitation of a generic computer \n6 cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. \" Id. at 223. To \nsave a patent at step two, an inventive concept must be evident in the claims. RecogniCorp , LLC \nv. Nintendo Co., 855 F.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nRoofr argues that the asserted patents are directed to abstract ideas and are therefore invalid \nas patent-ineligible under\u00a7 101. \nA. '800 Patent \n1. Alice Step One \nThe '800 patent addresses the problem of \"incorrectl y geo-coded \" and \"low-resolution \" \naerial image databases , which impede the reliability of roof reports that use images from those \ndatabases . See '800 Patent, 10:8-25; (see also D.I. 12 at 9-10). Claim 1 describes the process of \ndisplaying an image of a roof corresponding to a geographic location the user provides, allowing \nthe user to select a roof at a different geographic position within that image, allowing the user to \nconfirm that selection, and then providing an unspecified report for the selected roof. See '800 \nPatent, Claim 1. \nRoofr argues that claim 1 of the '800 patent \"claims the abstract idea of selecting a roof \nfrom an image.\" (D.I. 21 at 7). EagleView complain s that Roofr \"ignores numerous specifics of \nthe claims that tie them to the concrete technological improvement that EagleView developed. \" \n(D.I. 22 at 12-13) (highlighting the report element, as well as the fact that the user selects a \ngeographic location distinct from the location corresponding to the initial image). I agree that \nRoofr's characterization does not fully capture what the claims are \"directed to.\" The distinction \nbetween initial and user-derived location data is an important aspect of the claimed advance. The \nreport element, however, is too generic to constitute more than trivial \"post-solution activity.\" \n7 Bilski, 561 U.S. at 610-11. I therefore conclude that the claim is directed to selecting a roof from \nan image, where that image corresponds to a location other than that of the selected roof. \nThis formulation , however, does not help EagleView . Stripped of the generic report \nelement, claim 1 of the '800 patent amounts to \"limiting and coordinating the display of \ninformation based on a user selection. \" Zillow, 50 F.4th at 1378. The Federal Circuit has made \nclear that such claims are directed to an abstract idea. See, e.g., id. at 13 77-83; Trading Techs. \nInt'l, Inc. v. !BG LLC, 921 F.3d 1084, 1092-95 (Fed. Cir. 2019); Move, Inc. v. Real Estate All. \nLtd., 721 F. App'x 950, 956 (Fed. Cir. 2018). In particular , claim 1 is remarkabl y like the claims \ninvalidated in Zillow. The Zillow patent, which related to graphical display technolog y, recited \n\"presenting a map, having a user select a portion of that map, and then synchronizing the map and \nits corresponding list to display a more limited data set to the user.\" Zillow, 50 F.4th at 1378. The \nclaim here recites similar data manipulation steps: presenting an image, allowing the user to select \na portion of that image, and then displaying an updated result indicating the user's selection. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that the Zillow patent fell into the patent-ineligible abstract category of \n\"collection of information , comprehending the meaning of that collected information , and \nindication of the results, all on a generic computer network operating in its normal, expected \nmanner.\" Id. (citation omitted). Just so here. \nEagle View argues that the '800 patent is not directed to an abstract idea because it \"claims \na specific technique for identifying the roof of a building in an image for the purpose of \ndetermining the attributes of said roof' to overcome a problem \"specifically arising in the field of \ndigital imagery analysis for roof measuring .\" (D.I. 22 at 8-9). In support, Eagle View analogizes to \nDDRHoldings , LLCv. Hotels.com, L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014) andMcRO, Inc. v. Bandai \n8 Namco Games America, Inc., 837 F.3d 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016). (D.I. 22 at 11-12). Neither case is \nhelpful to Eagle View here. \nThe invention in DDR Holdings allowed a host merchant website to maintain its visual \n'look and feel' when a visitor, by clicking a hyperlinked advertisement , is transported to an outside \nmerchant's product page. 773 F.3d at 1257-58. The Federal Circuit held those claims to be patent\u00ad\neligible because \"they do not merely recite the performance of some business practice known from \nthe pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform it on the Internet. Instead, the claimed \nsolution is necessarily rooted in computer technology in order to overcome a problem specifically \narising in the realm of computer networks. \" Id. at 1257. Here, nothing about the asserted claim is \n\"necessarily rooted\" in computer technology. Identifying and presenting geographic information \nto a user is not a computer-centric solution; as Roofr points out, the same process has long been \naccomplished manually \"in the context of printed maps and atlases.\" (D.I. 23 at 1-2). \nMore importantly, the claim fails to recite any specific technological improvements. \nEagle View disagrees , arguing that the '800 patent claims a \"specific implementation \" akin to the \ntechnique claimed in McRO. (D.I. 22 at 11). I think McRO is distinguishable. That case dealt with \npatent claims directed to automatically animating facial expressions and lip synchronization for 3-\nD-animated characters. McRO, 837 F.3d at 1303. The Federal Circuit found those claims patent\u00ad\neligible because they recited \"specific, limited mathematical rules\" that were distinct from the \n\"subjective\" process previously employed by animators. Id. at 13-14. \nIn contrast, the technology recited in claim 1 is entirely conventional , \"requir[ing] nothing \nmore than generic computer technology. \" Zill ow, 50 F .4th at 13 79 ( quoting Int' l Bus. Machs. Corp. \nv. Zillow Grp., Inc., 549 F. Supp. 3d 1247, 1268 (W.D. Wash. 2021)). Roofr demonstrates why \nthis is so. (D.I. 21 at 8-9). First, the initial image \"may come from a variety\" of sources, including \n9 the public and well-known Google Earth image database. '800 Patent, 10:8-13. Second, both user \ninputs (roof selection and confirmation) may constitute conventional user input from a generic \ncomputer. E.g., id, 10:19-22 (roof selection may be \"by click and dragging via computer mouse, \narrows, or otherwise \"); id, 10:25-28 ( confirmation may be by \"button, enter, checkbox , or \notherwise\"). These techniques-mouse clicks, checkboxes , and confirmation buttons, and the \nlike-are routine computer functions. \nConsequently , the asserted claim \"fail[s] to recite any assertedly inventive technology for \nimproving computers as tools, and [is] instead directed to an abstract idea for which computers are \ninvoked merely as a tool,\" Zillow, 50 F.4th at 1377-78 (citations omitted). I therefore conclude \nthat claim 1 of the '800 patent is directed to an abstract idea. \n2. Alice Step Two \nBecause claim 1 of the '800 patent is directed to an abstract idea, I advance to Alice step \ntwo. \nIndividually , the elements do not recite an inventive concept. As discussed above, the \nspecification shows that elements such as the image display and user inputs merely rely on \nconventional computer functions. \nAs an ordered combination , the elements do not recite an inventive concept that is \n\"significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\" Alice, 573 U.S. at 218 (cleaned \nup). Generic computer activity cannot supply an inventive concept. See, e.g., Two-Way Media Ltd \nv. Comcast Commc 'ns, LLC, 874 F.3d 1329, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (no inventive concept where \nclaims recited nothing \"other than conventional computer and network components according to \ntheir ordinary functions \"). Eagle View argues that the conventionality of the user interface is a factual question that \ncannot be resolved at the motion to dismiss stage. (D.I. 22 at 13, 15) (citing Aatrix, 882 F.3d at \n1125). As the Federal Circuit has explained , however, \"the district court need not accept a patent \nowner's conclusory allegations of inventiveness. \" Zillow, 50 F.4th at 1379. \"Only plausible and \nspecific factual allegations that aspects of the claims are inventive are sufficient. \" Id. (citation \nomitted). Eagle View has not made plausible and specific allegations that the user interface is \ninventive. Ultimately , the claim recites nothing other than the use of routine computer functions \nto perform the abstract idea of selecting a roof from an image that did not originally correspond to \nthe selected roof. \nThus, claim 1 of the '800 patent does not suppl y an inventive concept at Alice step two. I \ntherefore GRANT Roofr' s motion to dismiss claim 1 of the '800 patent. \nB. '538 Patent \n1. Alice Step One \nClaim 1 of the '538 patent suffers from deficiencies similar to those in claim 1 of the '800 \npatent. The claim calls for the identification of the geographic location of a roof, the estimation of \nthe roofing area of that roof based on the \"predominant pitch \" and \"footprint\" of the roof as \nobtained from an image of the roof, and the subsequent generation of a roof report-featuring both \nan image of the roof and its estimated area-\"for determination of an amount of materials needed \nfor a construction project.\" '538 patent, Claim 1. Roofr argues that the claim is directed to the \nabstract idea of\"estimating roofing area using an image of a roof.\" (D.I. 21 at 14). This time, I \nthink that Roofr' s formulation is on point. \nThe Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that claims focused on \"collecting information , \nanalyzing it, and displaying certain results of the collection and analysis\" are directed to an abstract \n11 idea. See Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350, 1353-56 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Elec. \nPower is instructive . There, the representative claim recited \"[a] method of detecting events on an \ninterconnected electric power grid in real time over a wide area and automatically analyzing the \nevents on the interconnected electric power grid .... \" Id. at 1351. The method involved gathering \ndata from various sources, \"detecting and analyzing events in real-time ,\" and displaying the \nresults. Id. at 1352. The Federal Circuit held that these steps were abstract, as they did not \"go \nbeyond requiring the collection , analysis, and display of available information in a particular field, \nstating those functions in general terms, without limiting them to technical means for performing \nthe functions that are arguably an advance over conventional computer and network technology .\" \nId. at 1351. \nAs Roofr illustrates in its motion, claim 1 of the '5 3 8 patent boils down to a series of steps: \n\"(a) collecting tangible information-i.e ., a geographic location and corresponding image; (b) \nanalyzing that information using basic mathematical algorithms (e.g., to determine a footprint, \npredominant pitch, and an estimated roofing area); and ( c) displaying the results of the analysis \n('the estimated roofing area') and collected information ('at least one image showing the roof).\" \n(D.I. 21 at 23). Thus understood , the focus of the claims is on the selection of information , its \nanalysis, and reporting the results of the analysis. This is abstract. \nEagle View contends that its claim is not \"mere data analysis\" because, unlike the Elec. \nPower claims-which \"do not even require a new source or type of information , or new techniques \nfor analyzing it,\" 830 F.3d at 1355-EagleView 's claim recites a \"specific technique \" unknown \nin the prior art. (D.I. 22 at 15-16). Specifically, EagleView points to \"the specific technique of \nusing the roofs 'predominant pitch' and footprint\" to calculate roofing area from an image. (Id.). \n12 The trouble with Eagle View's argument is that the '538 patent neither claims a process for \nascertaining \"predominant pitch\" and \"footprint,\" nor claims a method of calculating roofing area \nfrom those parameters . The specification furnishes some details. For example, the specification \nsuggests that the \"footprint\" is the two-dimensional boundary or overall outline of the roof, '538 \nPatent, 12:8-9, and it states that the \"predominant pitch\" may, but need not, constitute a weighted \naverage of the individual pitch measurements for multiple portions of the roof, '538 Patent, 12: 12-\n37. The asserted claim, however, merely provides that a computer \"determine \" both parameters \n\"by analyzing one or more image showing the roof,\" and \"determine an estimated roofing area\" in \nan unspecified manner \"based on\" those parameters. '538 Patent, Claim 1. \nAs the Federal Circuit has explained , \"the\u00a7 101 inquiry must focus on the language of the \nAsserted Claims themselves , and the specification cannot be used to import details from the \nspecification if those details are not claimed.\" ChargePoint, Inc. v. SemaConnect , Inc., 920 F .3d \n759, 769 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). Generally , a \"result-oriented \" claim-one that \"merely \ndescribes an effect or result dissociated from any method by which it is accomplished\"-is \nabstract. Zillow, 50 F.4th at 1378. Claim 1 of the '538 patent calls for the desired result of \ndetermining roofing area using a roofs \"footprint\" and \"predominant pitch,\" but does not attempt \nto claim any method for achieving that result. Because it \"describe[ es] required functions ... \nwithout explaining how to accomplish any of the tasks,\" id., Eagle View's claim falls squarely into \nthe category of \"results-oriented\" claims that the Federal Circuit has found indicative of a patent\u00ad\nineligible abstract idea. \nOther problems abound. Even if claim 1 recited a formula for each of the methods described \nabove, the claim would be abstract. The Federal Circuit \"has treated analyzing information ... by \nmathematical algorithms , without more, as essentiall y mental processes within the abstract-idea \n13 category.\" Elec. Power, 830 F.3d at 1354. The claim here is directed to an abstract idea under \nthose principles , as the parameters computed under the claimed technique-such as roofing area \nand predominant pitch--comprise a series of mathematical calculations. \nEagle View counters that a claim is not doomed to abstraction if a mathematical formula is \nrequired to complete the claimed method. (D.I. 22 at 18). But the case Eagle View relies upon for \nthis proposition-Thales , 850 F.3d at 1349-is distinguishable. In Thales, the claims applied the \nlaws of physics to \"the unconventional configuration of sensors\" used to track an object on a \nmoving platform. Id. That is to say, those claims involved the use of mathematical algorithms to \nachieve a physical-realm improvement in tracking system technology . See id. at 1348-49. Here, \n\"the focus of the claims is not a physical-realm improvement but an improvement in wholly \nabstract ideas-the selection and mathematical analysis of information, followed by reporting or \ndisplay of the results.\" SAP America, Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC, 898 F.3d 1161, 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nI am not persuaded by EagleView 's suggestion that, under McRO, its claim is patent\u00ad\neligible by virtue of its novelty with respect to \"prior manual methods.\" (D.I. 22 at 16-17). As \nEagle View explains, traditional methods of roof measurement involve in-person site visits in \nwhich roofers climb atop the roof and manually measure the precise pitch of each facet. (E.g., D.I. \n12 at 4-5; D.I. 22 at 16-17). EagleView argues that the '538 patent's approach- \"on/y using \nimages\" to estimate roofing area, as well as employing predominant pitch to do so-supplies an \nunconventional concept that renders the claim patent-eligible. (D.I. 22 at 16-17). Indeed, as \nEagle View stresses both in its complaint and in its opposition brief, its technology has been praised \nas \"revolutionary \" in the roofing industry and recognized as such by another court. (See, e.g., id. \nat 4-5, 16-17; D.I. 12 at 5-6). \n14 As the Federal Circuit has acknowledged , however, it \"is not enough for eligibility\" that \nthe techniques claimed are \"groundbreaking , innovative, or even brilliant\" or \"novel and \nnonobvious in light of prior art.\" SAP America, 898 F.3d at 1163. Eagle View thus mischaracterizes \nMcRO. The claims in that case weren't patent-eligible simply because they were novel; they were \npatent-eligible because, as explained , they recited specific technological improvements that were \nthemselves unconventional. See McRO, 837 F.3d at 1303, 1313 (emphasizing that \"the claims are \nlimited to rules with specific characteristics \"). \nBy contrast, this claim,just like claim 1 of the '800 patent, recites conventional technology \nto implement conventional steps. As Roofr argues, the elements of the '538 claim amount to \nnothing more than \"basic parameters for calculating the area of a roof' (predominant pitch, \nfootprint, and area) \"using conventional computer components \" (a generic computer processor ). \n(D.I. 23 at 6). Both claims, apart from generic computer-implemented activities , recite processes \nthat can be accomplished off the computer ; as Roofr also observes, \"Each of the recited steps could \nbe performed manually by a person with access to physical photographs of a location.\" (D .I. 21 at \n16) ( explaining that, for example, a person could manually compute a roofs footprint and \npredominant pitch from an image of a building, estimate the roofing area using \"basic geometry ,\" \nand enter that information into a report). Consequently , claim 1 of the '538 patent \"fail[s] to recite \nany assertedly inventive technolog y for improving computers as tools, and [is] instead directed to \nan abstract idea for which computers are invoked merely as a tool.\" Zillow, 50 F.4th at 1377-78. \nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that claim 1 of the '538 patent is directed to an \nabstract idea. \n15 2. Alice Step 2 \nClaim 1 of the '538 patent does not recite an inventive concept. Eagle View's argument to \nthe contrary is that the recited technique is novel with respect to the field of image-based roof \nmeasurements. (D.I. 22 at 18-19). Whereas earlier approaches to image-based roof measurements \ninvolved \"trac[ing] the outline of every facet of the target roof and then calculat[ing] the pitch of \neach facet\" (D.I. 22 at 15), the '538 patent claims the \"novel and simpler\" approach of determining \narea from the roofs \"predominant pitch\" and \"footprint\" (id. at 16). According to Eagleview, this \nadvance supplies an inventive concept. (Id. at 18-19). Not so. \nEagle View relies upon Cosmo Key Sol 'ns GrnbH & Co. KG v. Duo Sec. LLC, 15 F .4th 1091 \n(Fed. Cir. 2021). In that case, the representative claim at issue disclosed a method for \nauthenticating the identity of a computer user performing an online transaction. Id. at 1093. The \nFederal Circuit concluded at step two that the claim recited an inventive concept, as it disclosed \n\"a specific improvement to authentication that increases security, prevents unauthorized access by \na third party, is easily implemented , and can advantageously be carried out with mobile devices of \nlow complexity. \" Id. at 1098. The Court found that the claims recite \"a technical solution to a \nsecurity problem in networks and computers ,\" id., emphasizing the specific improvements \nachieved by the claim limitations at issue. For example, the invention simplified the authentication \nprocess because \"the only activity that is required from the user for authentication purposes is to \nactivate the authentication function at a suitable timing for the transaction. \" Id. at 1099. \nCosmoKey, in short, answered the question of whether the claims at issue recited a \n\"technological solution to a technological problem\"-an inquiry that may arise at either step one \nor step two of Alice. See F45 Training Pty Ltd. v. Body Fit Training USA Inc., 2022 WL 17177621 , \nat *6 n.1 (D. Del. Nov. 17, 2022); see also Zeta Global Corp. v. Maropost Marketing Cloud, Inc., \n16 2022 WL 2533182, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2022) (citing CosmoKey at step one). I have already \naddressed this question at step one. Although Eagle View is right that claim 1 of the '538 patent \nresembles the CosmoKey claim insofar as both patents provide \"simpler\" approaches (D.I. 22 at \n18-19), that resemblance is superficial. The CosmoKey claim recited a specific technological \nimprovement to address a technological problem; here, the claim fails to recite technological \nimprovements or benefits beyond the use of the predominant pitch algorithm , which is itself an \nabstract idea. \nFurther, it does not appear that the purported improvement with respect to image-based \nroof measurements is tethered to the claim at issue. As Roofr observes (D.I. 21 at 16), Claim 1 \ndoes not recite any particular method for calculating predominant pitch, and the specification \nindicates that one possible method is a \"weighted average of individual pitch factors.\" '538 Patent, \n12:12-14. Such a method would not obviate the need to calculate the pitch of every facet of the \ntarget roof. \nThus, I conclude that claim 1 of the '538 patent does not recite an inventive concept. I \ntherefore GRANT Roofr's motion to dismiss claim 1 of the '538 patent. \nC. '840 Patent \n1. Alice Step 1 \nThe '840 patent resembles the '538 patent (which EagleView has characterized as \"an \nimprovement on the '840.\" (Tr. at 54)). Its general purpose is the same: measuring a roof based on \nan aerial image. '840 patent, 1: 16-20. Claim 1 requires displaying an aerial image of a roof, \noverlaying a \"pitch determination marker\" tool on the image, allowing a user to manually operate \nthe tool to input the pitch of a roof section, and modifying an unspecified model of a roof based \non that input. '840 Patent, Claim 1. \n17 Roofr argues that claim 1 of the '840 patent claims \"the abstract idea of determining the \npitch of a roof section using an aerial image of a roof.\" (D.I. 21 at 20). I agree. \nThis claim presents the same problems as the last claim. Like claim 1 of the '538 patent, \nclaim 1 of the '840 patent does not \"go beyond requiring the collection, analysis, and display of \navailable information \" as implemented via routine computer processes . Elec. Power, 830 F.3d at \n1351. The two primary limitations that distinguish this patent from the '538 patent-the \"pitch \ndetermination marker\" and the modification of a roof model-recite nothing unconventional. The \n\"pitch determination marker\" (which the specification also calls a \"protractor tool,\" '840 Patent, \n12:40-54) is the computer analog of a standard real-world protractor , the purpose of which is, of \ncourse, to draw and measure angles. The claim discloses no unconventional technique for \nimplementing this tool. Neither does the claim disclose an unconventional technique ( or, for that \nmatter, any specific technique at all) for modifying a model of the roof. \nThese limitations do not, therefore, constitute \"specific technical solutions to technical \nproblems. \" (D.I. 22 at 20). In arguing to the contrary, Eagle View relies heavily on the Xactware \ndecisions. (See id at 20-21). I have read and considered those decisions , and my conclusion is that \nthey are not applicable here. \nI begin by noting that the Xactware decisions dealt with different claims of the '840 patent. \nXactware I involved claims 10 and 18. 358 F. Supp. 3d at 402 n. 2. Xactware II involved claim \n10. 485 F. Supp. 3d at 513. EagleView concedes that no New Jersey Court has decided whether \nclaim 1 of the '840 patent is patent-eligible. (Tr. at 67). As Roofr observes, however, claim 10 is \n\"[n]early identical to claim l.\" (Id at 78). This difference, then, does not necessarily resolve the \nmatter. \n18 What does strike me as significant is the fact that the Xactware decisions centered on an \naspect of Eagle View's inventions that is not at issue here. Looking first to Xactware I, it is apparent \nthat the Court evaluated the six asserted patents \"as a whole.\" 358 F. Supp. 3d at 406-07. Most of \nthose patents related to the correlation of non-stereoscopic (i.e., non-3-D) aerial roof images to \ngenerate a three-dimensional model of the roof. See id. at 407-08. Accordingl y, the Court found \nthat the claims at issue were \"directed to correlating points on different aerial views of different \nplanar sections of a roof in order to create a mathematical model or 'geometric identification ' of \nthe contours of the roof section by calculating through photogrammetry common geometric roof \nfeatures.\" Id. at 407. The Court relied on that correlation function in determining that the claims \nsurvived Alice step one. See id. at 409. It did so again at Alice step two. See id. at 410. \nThe same is true of Xactware II That case involved all but one of the patents involved in \nXactware I. Xactware II, 485 F. Supp. 3d at 510. The Court, again examining the asserted patents \nas a group, id. at 517-18, found that Eagle View's claims \"present a solution ... to the method of \nclimbing up on the roof' by \"having the computer correlate two non-stereoscopic views of \ndifferent sections of a roof.\" Id. at 518. The Court's step-one analysis relied on this characterization \nof the claims, see id., and although the Court did not reach step two, it indicated that its step-two \nanalysis would echo the analysis in Xactware I. Id. at 518 n. 9. \nIn contrast to Xactware , in which the majority of the patents at issue involved the \ncorrelation of multiple images, here, none of them do. In particular , as Eagle View has \nacknowledged , there is nothing in claim 1 of the '840 patent involving two different non-\n19 stereoscopic aerial views. (Tr. at 67). I am therefore unpersuaded by the Xactware Court's \nreasoning with respect to the patent-eligibility of claim 1 of the '840 patent. 2 \nThus, for the foregoing reasons , I conclude that claim 1 of the '840 patent is directed to an \nabstract idea. \n2. Alice Step 2 \nClaim 1 of the '840 patent does not recite an inventive concept. As discussed above, the \nclaim elements are, individually , conventional. EagleView points to the fact that the claim \ndiscloses an \"entirely new\" alternative to traditional roof measurement methods. (D.I. 22 at 22). \nWhat, however, is the inventive concept here? I agree with Roofr that EagleView 's opposition \nbrief is unclear on this point. (See D.I. 23 at 9). If the purported inventive concept stems from the \nautomation of traditional roofing methods, then that is not enough; a patent that simply proposes \n\"doing it on the computer \" is abstract, even if automation has brought significant advances to the \nindustry. See, e.g., Univ. of Fla. Research Found., Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 916 F.3d 1363, 1367 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019). \nAnother possibility is that the purported inventive concept stems from the translation of a \ntwo-dimensional image to a three-dimensional model, as Eagle View suggested at oral argument. \n(E.g., Tr. at 75). Nothing in claim 1 explicitly requires the model to be three-dimensional ; in fact, \nthe model may be two-dimensional. Eagle View concedes this: (Id. at 70). It argues, however, that \n2 For similar reasons, I am unpersuaded by the Court's opinion in Eagle View Techs. v. GAF \nMaterials , LLC., No. 2:22-215-TS-DAO (D. Utah Dec. 12, 2022), which Eagle View submitted as \nsubsequent authority . (D.I. 26-1, Ex. 1). There, the '840 patent was one of nine patents before the \nCourt. (Id. at 1 ). The Court analyzed them together and, in holding that the asserted claims were \nnon-abstract , found that \"the claims are directed to methods and processes of constructing a 3D \nmodel from two photographs to facilitate roof repair or replacement. \" (Id. at 6). Thus, the GAF \nMaterials decision, like the Xactware decision, centered on an aspect of the asserted claims that is \nnot at issue here. \n20 the claim's pitch determination marker element requires three dimensions-perhaps because \ncalculating measurements from an image necessarily involves incorporating the angle at which the \nimage was taken. (See id. at 71-73 ). In any event, claim 1 does not disclose any specific method \nfor how one translates two-dimensional information to three-dimensional information ; it merely \nrecites the desired results. The same is true of the other two patents, which Eagle View suggests \nreflect the same innovation . (See, e.g., id. at 31-32, 35).3 \nThis goes to the primary concern that drives the \u00a7 101 analysis: the monopolization of \nabstract intellectual concepts. See Mayo, 566 U.S. at 70. EagleView may not monopolize the \nabstract idea of deriving three-dimensional measurements from two-dimensional images. The fact \nthat each claim is limited to the roofing context is immaterial ; \"[L]imiting the claims to [a] \nparticular technological environment . . . is, without more, insufficient to transform them into \npatent-eligible applications of the abstract idea at their core.\" Elec. Power, 830 F.3d at 1355. \nConsequently , I conclude that claim 1 of the '840 patent is not directed to an inventive \nconcept. I therefore GRANT Roofr' s motion to dismiss claim 1 of the '840 patent. \n3 I therefore reject Eagle View's argument that the conventionality of this innovation represents an \nunresolved fact question that I cannot consider on a motion to dismiss. (See D.I. 24-25). Eagle View \ncannot avoid dismissal \"simply by reciting in the complaint that the invention at issue is novel and \nnonconventional .\" British Telecommc 'ns PLVv. IAC/InterActiveCorp ., 381 F. Supp. 3d 293, 322-\n23 (D. Del. 2019). To preclude dismissal , EagleView must offer \"detailed factual allegations \nraising issues of fact.\" Id. at 10. Asserting an inventive concept without tethering it to the claims \ndoes not suffice. The same is true of Eagle View's argument with respect to the conventionality of \nthe predominant pitch algorithm. (See D.I. 22 at 17). \n21 IV. CONCLUSI ON \nI grant Roofr's motion to dismiss claim 1 of each of the asserted patents. I deny the motion, \nwithout prejudice to raising the same arguments at summary judgment, as to the other 60 claims \nin the asserted patents. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n22 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEAGLE VIEW TECHNOLOGIES , INC., and \nPICTOMETRY INTERNATIONAL CORP., \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nROOFR, INC., \nDefendant.
