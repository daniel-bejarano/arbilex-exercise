Pending before me is Mizuho\u2019s motion to transfer this case to the\nNorthern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). D.I. 15.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs are Indiana corporations with principal places of business in\nChicago, Illinois. D.I. 1 \u00a7\u00a7] 2-4. Mizuho is a Delaware corporation with its\nprincipal place of business in Union City, California. D.I. 1 6. Mizuho designs\nand manufactures tables and other products used for surgeries. D.I. 1 \u00a7 11; D.I. 20\nat 2. Plaintiffs accuses four Mizuho surgery tables and associated products of\ninfringing Plaintiffs\u2019 patents. D.I. 1 4 50.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Legal Standards\n\nSection 1404(a) provides that \u201c[flor the convenience of the parties and\nwitnesses, in the interests of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to\nany other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or\ndivision to which all parties have consented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). Mizuho\n\ncontends, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that this action could have been brought in\nthe Northern District of California. D.J. 20 at 3. Thus, the only issue before me is\nwhether I should exercise my discretion under \u00a7 1404(a) to transfer the case to the\nNorthern District of California.\nMizuho has the burden \u201c\u2018to establish that a balancing of proper interests\nweigh{[s] in favor of the transfer.\u201d Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25\n(3d Cir. 1970). This burden is heavy. \u201c[U]nless the balance of convenience of the\nparties is strongly in favor of [the] defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should\nprevail.\u201d Jd. (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nAlthough there is \u201cno definitive formula or list of the factors to consider\u201d in\na transfer analysis, the Third Circuit identified in Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55\nF.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995), 12 interests \u201cprotected by the language of \u00a7\n1404(a).\u201d Id. Six of those interests are private:\n[1] plaintiff's forum preference as manifested in the\noriginal choice; [2] the defendant\u2019s preference; [3]\nwhether the claim arose elsewhere; [4] the convenience\nof the parties as indicated by their relative physical and\nfinancial condition; [5] the convenience of the\nwitnesses\u2014but only to the extent that the witnesses may\nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and [6]\nthe location of books and records (similarly limited to the\nextent that the files could not be produced in the\nalternative forum).\n\nId. (internal citations omitted). The other six interests are public in nature:\n[7] the enforceability of the judgment; [8] practical\nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious,\n\nor inexpensive; [9] the relative administrative difficulty\n\n2\nin the two fora resulting from court congestion; [10] the\nlocal interest in deciding local controversies at home;\n[11] the public policies of the fora; and [12] the\nfamiliarity of the trial judge with the applicable state law\nin diversity cases.\nId, at 879-80 (internal citations omitted). As the parties have not identified\nrelevant factors beyond these 12 interests, I will balance the Jumara factors in\ndeciding whether to exercise the discretion afforded me by \u00a7 1404(a).\n1. Plaintiff\u2019s Forum Preference\nIn Shutte, the Third Circuit held that \u201c[i]t is black letter law that a plaintiffs\nchoice of a proper forum is a paramount consideration in any determination of a\ntransfer request\u201d brought pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a), and that this choice \u201cshould not be\nlightly disturbed.\u201d 431 F.2d at 25 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nJumara cited Shutte favorably and reiterated Shutte\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe\nplaintiff's choice of venue should not be lightly disturbed.\u201d Jumara, 55 F.3d at\n879 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, this factor\nweighs strongly against transfer.\n2. Defendant\u2019s Forum Preference\nThis factor weighs in favor of transfer.\n3. Whether the Claims Arose Elsewhere\n\nIt is undisputed that Mizuho designed, developed, and manufactured the\n\naccused products in the Northern District of California. The connection between\nthose efforts and the Northern District favors transfer. See In re Hoffmann-La\nRoche, Inc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009). On the other hand, patent\nclaims arise wherever the allegedly infringing products are sold. See Treehouse\nAvatar LLC v. Valve Corp., 170 F. Supp. 3d 706, 710 (D. Del. 2016). Plaintiffs\ncontend that this factor weighs against transfer because Mizuho\u2019s sales of the\naccused products in Delaware\u2014regardless of the actual dollar amount of sales\u2014\ngive rise to Plaintiffs\u2019 infringement claims. D.I. 20 at 7. Mizuho acknowledges\nthat it sells the accused products in Delaware but asserts that its Delaware sales\ncomprise a \u201cminiscule\u201d 0.32% of its overall sales of the accused products, while its\nCalifornia sales account for 10.1%. D.I. 16 at 4, 9. Overall, this factor weighs\nslightly in favor of transfer.\n\n4. The Convenience of the Parties as Indicated by Their\nRelative Physical and Financial Condition\n\n\u201c[A]bsent some showing of a unique or unexpected burden, a company\nshould not be successful in arguing that litigation in its state of incorporation is\ninconvenient.\u201d ADE Corp. v. KLA-Tencor Corp., 138 F. Supp. 2d 565, 573 (D.\nDel. 2001). Mizuho is incorporated in Delaware. To establish \u201cinconvien(ce],\u201d\ntherefore, Mizuho must show that it would face \u201ca unique or unexpected burden\u201d\nin having to litigate this case in this District.\n\nCalifornia would be a more convenient forum for Mizuho than Delaware, as\nMuzuho\u2019s witnesses and documents are in California. But Plaintiffs have a\n\n4\n\u201csubstantial presence\u201d in Massachusetts, making it easier for relevant employees\nand named inventors on the patents-in-suit\u2014most of whom reside on or near the\nEast Coast\u2014to travel to Delaware than to California. D.I. 20 at 9-10. Because\nthis District is more convenient for the Plaintiffs, and Delaware is not a particularly\ninconvenient forum for Mizuho, the convenience of the parties weighs slightly\nagainst transfer.\n5. The Convenience of Witnesses\n\nAccording to Mizuho, this factor favors transfer \u201c[b]ecause several likely\nnon-party witnesses are within the subpoena power of the Northern District of\nCalifornia, and none are within the subpoena power of this Court,\u201d including\nGregory Hirth and Mark Diel, who \u201cwere each the Director of Research and\nDevelopment at Mizuho during the design and development of the accused Trios\nand ProAxis tables\u201d and \u201care co-inventors on patents embodying these accused\nproducts.\u201d D.I. 16 at 11-12. Plaintiffs contend that this factor is neutral because\nMizuho has not shown that the two former Mizuho employees \u201cwould refuse to\nvoluntarily appear in Delaware for trial if asked to do so,\u201d and has not otherwise\n\u201cidentiflied] any witness who is unwilling to testify at trial in Delaware.\u201d D.I. 20\nat 11. But it is true that the non-party witnesses located in California cannot be\ncompelled by Mizuho or this Court to testify in a trial in Delaware. Moreover, in\n\nconsidering this factor, \u201cthe Court should be particularly concerned not to\ncountenance undue inconvenience to third-party witnesses, who have no direct\nconnection to the litigation.\u201d Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Altera Corp., 842 F.\nSupp. 2d 744, 757 (D. Del. 2012), mandamus denied sub nom. In re Altera Corp.,\n494 F. App\u2019x 52 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Accordingly, this factor favors transfer.\n6. Location of Books and Records\nThis factor favors transfer because Mizuho\u2019s relevant documents and\nphysical evidence\u2014including the \u201cbulky surgical tables\u201d accused of\ninfringement\u2014are located in California, and it would be more difficult and\nexpensive to transport them to Delaware than to a courthouse in the Northern\nDistrict. D.I. 16 at 13.\n7. Enforceability of the Judgment\nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral and/or inapplicable. See D.I. 16\nat 14; D.I. 20 at 13.\n8. Practical Considerations\nJumara instructs me to give weight to \u201cpractical considerations that could\nmake the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive.\u201d 55 F.3d at 879. This factor\nfavors transfer, as neither Plaintiffs nor Mizuho has a connection with Delaware\nother than Mizuho\u2019s incorporation status. Witnesses and evidence are located in\n\nCalifornia but not in Delaware.\n9. Relative Administrative Difficulty Due to Court\nCongestion\n\nGiven the districts\u2019 relative caseloads, this factor favors transfer. According\nto the most recent data provided by the Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 there were 953 weighted\nfilings per judge in this District, as compared to 816 weighted filings per judge in\nthe Northern District of California. See\nhttps://www.uscourts. gov/statistics/table/na/federal-court-management-\nstatistics/2021/12/31-1. Weighted filings \u201caccount for the different amounts of\ntime district judges require to resolve various types of civil and criminal actions.\u201d\nAdmin. Office of the U.S. Courts, Explanation of Selected Terms,\nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/explanation-selected-terms-district-\nmarch-2012_0.pdf. Cases that require substantially more judicial resources than\nthe average civil case because of their complexity and scope receive a higher\nweight. Id.\n\nI am also of the view that the weighted filing figures do not always\naccurately reflect the burdens imposed on district courts by patent cases, which are\nespecially complex and time-consuming to adjudicate. According to data\naggregated by the LexisNexis Litigation Analytics tool, as of February 12, 2022,\n\nthere were 970 open patent cases in the District of Delaware as compared to 267\nopen patent cases in the Northern District of California.' The disparity in the\ncourts\u2019 burdens is compounded by the fact that the District of Delaware currently\nhas only three district judges, while the Northern District of California has 19\nsitting district judges (eight of whom have taken senior status). See\nhttps://www.cand.uscourts.gov/judges; see also\nhttps://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/ce9/2022/Corley_Jacqueline_Scott_CAN_C\nonfirmed.pdf.\n10. Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home\nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral. See D.I. 20 at 16; D.I. 24 at 11.\n11. Public Policies of the Fora\nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral and/or inapplicable. See D.I. 16\nat 14; DI. 20 at 13.\n\n12. Familiarity of the Trial Judges with the Applicable State\nLaw in Diversity Cases\n\nThe parties agree that this factor is neutral and/or inapplicable. See D.I. 16\nat 14; D.I. 20 at 13.\n\n* * OK *\n\n' Courts & Judges Comparator, Comparison Between District of Delaware\n(D.Del) and Northern District of California (N.D.Cal) for Cases Pending Between\n2009-01-01 and 2022-2-12, LEXISNEXIS (last visited April 5, 2022) (on file with\ncourt).\nIn sum, of the 12 Jumara factors, four factors are neutral, two factors weigh\nagainst transfer, and six factors weigh in varying degrees in favor of transfer.\nAlthough Plaintiffs\u2019 forum choice is of paramount importance, when considered in\ntheir totality, the Jumara factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer. I will\ntherefore grant Mizuho\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the Northern District of\nCalifornia.\n\nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nALLEN MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nand HILL-ROM SERVICES, INC.,\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nVv.\n\nMIZUHO ORTHOPEDIC Civil Action No. 21-1739-CFC\nSYSTEMS, INC.
