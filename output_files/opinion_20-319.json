July 12, 2022 \nBefore the Court is Defendants\u2019 Motion to D ismiss ( D.I. 51) under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6).  T he Court will grant the Motion a s to the civil rights claims against \nDefendant Delaware Dep artment of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d) because, as Plaintiff  concedes, \nsovereign immunity bars those claims.  But, for the reasons set forth below, the Court will deny \nthe Motion as to the breach of  contract cl aim ag ainst t he DOC , and a s to the excessive force \nclaim against D efendant  Sergeant  Mason Frazier. \nI. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND1\nPlaintiff J ason T. O\u2019Neil has be en incarcerated at the James T. Vaughn C orrectional C enter \nin Smyrna, Delaware since 2013. \n1  Because the Court is writing for the parties, this Memorandum includes only the background \nrelevant to the disposition of the instant Motion. 2 \n In 2016, in CLASI v. Coupe , Civ . No. 15- 688-GMS (D. Del), the DOC entered into a \nSettlement Agreement providing, among other things, for the improvement of mental health \nservices for inmates in the DOC\u2019s custody.  D.I. 47 \u00b6 18; id. at Ex. B (copy of Settlement Agreement).  Plaintiff contends that he was one of the original inmates of the plaintiff class in CLASI , and thus the Settlement Agreement is a binding contract between him and the DOC.  D.I. \n47 \u00b6 19. \nOn August 13, 2019, Plaintiff  attempted to swallow a paper clip, and had a  verbal exchange \nwith Sergeant Frazier ,\n2 who declined to call a licensed mental health professional.  Id.  \u00b6 13.  The \nverbal exchange between Plaintiff and Sergeant  Frazier escalated , and Sergeant Frazier sprayed \nPlaintiff with pepper spray until the pepper spray can was empty.  Id.   This caused Plaintiff \npermanent eye damage.  Id. \nOn March 10, 2020, Plaintiff  swallowed four sporks, a pen, and a piece of metal \napproximately 16cm long\u2014which may have been a radio antenna.  Id.  \u00b6 14.   As a result, Plaintiff \nhad blood in his stool and endured severe pain.  Id.  H e asked to be sent to the hospital.  Id.   The \nDOC refused.  Id. \u00b6 15 \u201316.  Instead, it had its internal  medical team monitor him , including with \nx-rays to look for organ perforation.  Id.   Three months later, after Plaintiff had developed an \nabdominal herni a, the DOC sent him to an outside hospital.  Id.  \u00b6 16. \nPlaintiff claims that (1) the DOC violated his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to properly \ntreat him for the injuries he suffered by intentionally swallowing the aforementioned objects; (2) \nthe DOC breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to make mental health care accessible to him; and (3) that Sergeant Frazier used excessive force against Plaintiff by emptying a can of \n \n2  The operative complaint refers to Sergeant Frazier as \u201cCorporal Frazier.\u201d  The Court will follow \nthe parties \u2019 briefs by referring to him as \u201cSergeant Frazier.\u201d  \n 3 \n pepper spray on hi m, causing permanent eye damage.   Defendants move under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss these claims .3  D.I. 51.  \nPlaintiff concedes that his claims against the DOC \u2014except for breach of contract \u2014are \nbarred by sovereign immunity and must be dismissed.  D.I. 56 p.1.  Acco rdingly, for purposes of \nthe instant M otion, the parties only dispute whether the following claims should be dismissed: \n(1) breach of contract against the DOC; and (2) excessive force against Sergeant Frazier.   The \nCourt will grant the unopposed portion of  Defendants\u2019 M otion and dismiss the civil rights claims \nagainst the DOC.  \nBut, for the reasons that follow, the Court will deny Defendants\u2019 M otion as to (1) the breach \nof contract claim against the DOC and the (2) excessive force claim against Sergeant Frazier.  \nII. JURISDICTION  \nThis Court has jurisdiction over the federal civil rights claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.  This \nCourt has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1367(a).  See  De Asencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 342 F.3d 301, 308 (3d Cir . 2003) (noting when \n\u201cstate- law claims share a \u2018common nucleus of operative fact\u2019 with the claims that supported the \ndistrict court\u2019 s original jurisdiction,\u201d exercising supplemental jurisdiction is proper) (quoting \nU.S. Mine Workers v. Gibbs , 383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966)).  \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint \nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  When considering such a motion, a court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most \n \n3  Plaintif f also has claims  against additional defendants , but they are not part of   the instant Motion.  \nSee D.I. 35 (staying claims against certain defendants due to bankruptcy proceedings).  \n 4 \n favorable to the plaintiff.  Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).  To state \na claim upon which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the pleading must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).  A \nclaim is facially plausible when the factual allegations allow a  court to draw a  reasonable \ninference that the  defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 663; \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555\u201356. \nIV. DISCUSSION  \nA. Breach of Cont ract (against the DOC ) \nTo state a claim for breach of contract under Delaware law, a plaintiff must allege (1) the \nexistence of a contract; (2) breach of the contract; (3) damages as a result of the breach; and (4) that plaintiff performed its duties under  the contract.  VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett -Packard Co., \n840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del. 2003).  Here, for purposes of the instant Motion, only the first element is disputed: Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to plead the existence of a contract.  \nMore specifically, Defendants  argue  that Plaintiff\u2019s allegations do not point to any relevant \nprovision of  the Settlement Agreement  that is relevant to his theory of breach.  See D.I. 52 pp. 9\u2013\n10.  This argument hinges on whether Plaintiff has al leged that the DOC denied him mental  \nhealth care, as opposed to physical  health care.  This is because the Settlement Agreement \nrequires  the DOC to \u201cmake mental health services in the continuum of care, outpatient through \ninpatient, accessible to all inmates in need of such services,\u201d see D.I. 47 Ex. B p.4 \u00b6 G, but 5 \n Plaintiff does not point to, and the Court does not discern, a similar obligation in the Agreement \nregarding physical health services.4 \nIn the operative complaint, Plaintiff alleges , among other things , that \u201c[o]n August 13, 2019, \nduring an attempt to swallow a paper clip [Sergeant] Frazier declined to call a licensed mental health professional.\u201d  D.I. 47 \u00b6 13.  Six months later, \u201c[o]n March 10, 2020, Mr. O\u2019Neil swallowed four sporks, a pen, and a piece of metal (believed to be a radio antenna) approximately 16cm long.  Mr. O\u2019Neil requested to be sent to the hospital to receive appropriate treatment.\u201d  Id.  \u00b6 14.  But the DOC did not send Plaintiff to the hospital until three months later, \nopting to monitor and treat him within its own facilities .  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 15 \u201316; see also  id. at Ex A \n(Plaintiff\u2019s DOC medical records); D.I. 52 at 7 n.4 (describing Plaintiff\u2019s medical treatment by DOC) .  Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that the DOC breached its obligation to make necessary mental \nhealth services  accessible  to him.  See D.I. 47 \u00b6 24.  \nDefen dants\u2019 position is that \u201cPlaintiff does not allege any facts that would suggest that the \ntreatment at the  [outside]  hospital would have provided mental health care as contemplated in the \nsettlement agreement.\u201d  D.I. 52 p. 10.  Defendants are correct, but t hey fail to explain why the \nallegation that Sergeant Frazier declined to call a licensed mental health professional is \ninsufficient  to adequately plead that the DOC failed to make mental health services accessible.\n5  \n \n4  See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (A \u201cdocument \nintegral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint\u201d may be considered \u201cwithout converting the \nmotion [to dismiss] into one for summary judgment.\u201d) (emphasis in original). \n5  Defendants do, however, contend that Plaintiff cannot use this allegation in support of his \nbreach of contract claim because he does not repeat it in latter portion of his complaint where he \nbreaks his allegations into counts.  See D.I. 57 (arguing Plaintiff pointing to this allegation in his response to the Motion is an attempt to amend his pleading via his brief ).  But Plaintiff\u2019s Count \nII (breach of contract ) specifically re- alleges and incorporates that allegation.  Compare  D.I. 47 \u00b6 \n13 (\u201cOn August 13, 2019, during an attempt to swallow a paper clip [Sergeant]  Frazier  declined \nto call a licensed mental health professional. \u201d) with  id. at \u00b6 2 3 (re-alleging and incorporating by \nreference paragraphs 1 \u201319).  6 \n See D.I. 47 \u00b6 13.  Defendants are also correct that some of Plaintiff\u2019s  allegations are conclusory \nassertions that the Court does not presume true.  See, e.g. , id. \u00b6 24 (alleging \u201c[f]ailure to send Mr. \nO\u2019Neill [sic] to the hospital deprived him of necessary m ental health and physical treatment.\u201d).  \nBut Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the DOC (via Sergeant Frazier) refused to call a licensed mental \nhealth professional for him is entitled to the presumption of truth on a motion to dismiss.  See id. \n\u00b6 13 (\u201cOn August 13, 2019, during an attempt to swallow a paper clip [Sergeant]  Frazier \ndeclined to call a licensed mental health professional.\u201d) . \nMaking the required  inferences in favor of Plaintiff, he has adequately pleaded that by \nrefusing to call a mental health profe ssional, the DOC breached the Settlement Agreement by \nfailing to make mental health services accessible to him.  \nDefendants  also argue that Plaintiff failed to adequately plead the existence of a contract \nbecause, in their view, he failed to allege a specific obligation of the Settlement Agreement that \nhe contends was breached.  See D.I. 52 p. 10.  Not so.  His complaint explicitly  alleges a  theory \nof breach based on the Agreemen t\u2019s requirement that the DOC make mental health care \naccessible.  See D.I. 47 \u00b6 24.  The cases Defendants cite requiring a claimant to identify the provision that was allegedly breached center on whether a pleading gives adequate notice to the defending pa rty.  Here, the operative complaint clearly identifies the obligation Plaintiff contends \nwas breached, thus providing adequate notice.  \nPlaintiff has adequately pleaded a breach of contract claim against the DOC.  \n  7 \n B. Excessive force (against Sergeant Frazier ) \nThe Eighth Amendment protects inmates from excessive force by prison officials.  See \nWhitley v. Albers , 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986).  The use of force is actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1983 when it exceeds \u201cthat which is reasonable and necessary under the circu mstances.\u201d  \nDavidson v. O\u2019Lone , 752 F.2d 817, 827 (3d Cir. 1984).  \u201cT he infliction of pain in the course of a \nprison security measure . . . does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment simply because it \nmay appear in retrospect that the degree of force authorized or applied for security purposes was \nunreasonable, and hence unnecessary in the strict sense.\u201d   Whitley , 475 U.S. at 319.  Rather, the  \nkey inquiry in excessive force claims is \u201cwhether force was applied in a good- faith effort to \nmaintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d  Hudson v. McMillian , 503 U.S. 1, 7 (1992); see also  Wilkins v. Gaddy , 559 U.S. 34 (2010). \nIn making that inquiry, the Court considers the following factors: (1) the need for the \napplication of force; (2) the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used; (3) the extent of the injury inflicted; (4) the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible \nofficials; and (5) the efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful re sponse.  Brooks v. Kyler , \n204 F.3d 102, 106 (3d Cir. 2000); see also Whitley , 475 U.S. at 321. \nHere, Plaintiff\u2019s excessive force claim centers on the allegation that Sergeant Frazier emptied \na can of pepper spray on him  in an apparent effort to prevent him from swallowing a paper clip:  \nOn August 13, 2019, during an attempt to swallow a paper clip [Sergeant]  Frazier declined to \ncall a licensed mental health professional.  The verbal exchange between Mr. O\u2019Neil and \n[Sergeant] Frazier escalated and [Sergeant] Frazier sprayed Mr. O\u2019Neil with pepper spray until \nthe pepper spray can was empty causing Mr. O\u2019Neil pe rmanent eye damage.  \nD.I. 47 \u00b6 13.  \n Defendants  argue that Plaintiff fails to state a claim of excessive force against Sergeant \nFrazier because he does not allege that Sergeant Frazier\u2019s use of force was not a good faith 8 \n attempt to restore order , or that he acted maliciously or sadistically to intentionally cause harm.  \nRather, Defendants argue, Sergeant Frazier acted reasonably as a matter of law to prevent \nPlaintiff from harming himself by swallowing a paperclip.   E.g., D.I. 52 p. 12. \n Plaintiff counters that emptying a can of pepper spray into his face to stop him from \nswallowing a paperclip makes no sense.  D.I. 56 p.5. \nApplying the factors  set forth above , taking the allegations as true and drawing the required \ninferences in favor of Plaintiff,  Sergeant Frazier \u2019s use of force exceeded that which was \nreasonable and necessary under the circumstances.  By swallowing a paperclip, Plaintiff only \nendangered himself.  And that danger seems \u2014based on the allegations, unlikely to place \nPlaintiff\u2019s life or  major body functions in serious imminent peril.  So the need to apply force \u2014if \nany\u2014wa s minimal.  While perhaps some level of force could be warranted to prevent an inmate \nfrom voluntarily swallowing a paperclip, emptying a can of pepper spray on  the inmate  to do so \ndoes not seem reasonable as a matter of law .  This is especially true given that it seems that the \nonly effect of the pepper spray was to allegedly cause permanent eye damage.  Nothing in the allegations suggests that Sergeant Frazier reasonably  perceived any additional threat or that his \nactions were to protect himself  or third persons .  Similarly, nothing in the allegations \u2014other than \nperhaps the fact that there was a verbal exchange \u2014suggests that Sergeant Frazier made any \nattempt to temper the  severity of his force.  \nDefendants\u2019 remaining arguments for dismissal of the excessive force claim fare no better.  \nFor example, they contend Plaintiff\u2019s claim should be dismissed because he fails to allege \u201cbasic facts\u201d such as \u201cthe duration Plaintiff was allegedly pepper sprayed.\u201d  Id.  at p.13.  Plaintiff \nexplicitly alleges that the entire can was emptied.  Facts like how long that took are a matter for discovery.  Here, their absence is not sufficient for dismissal.  Defendants also point out that the 9 \n use of pepper spray by prison pers onnel on an inmate is not excessive force per se.  See  id. \n(citing cases).  Although true, that is  not the issue.  The issue is whether the allegations about \nSergeant Frazier\u2019s use of pepper spray plead  excessive force sufficiently to survive dismissal .  \nThey do. \nPlaintiff has adequately pleaded an excessive force claim against Sergeant Frazier.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 51)  \nas to (1) Count I against the DOC (deliberate indifference to serious medical needs); and (2) \nCount III against the DOC (excessive force .)  The Court will deny Defendants\u2019 Motion as to (1) \nCount II against the DOC  (breach of contract); and (2) Count III against Sergeant Frazier \n(excessive fo rce.) \nAn appropriate order follows.
