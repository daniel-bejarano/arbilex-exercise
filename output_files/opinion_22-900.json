The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection with Defendant\u2019s \nmotion, heard oral argument, and applied the relevant legal standards for review of this type of Section 101-related motion at the pleading stage, which it has previously set out in Genedics, LLC v. Meta Co., Civil Action No. 17-1062-CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2-5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).    The Court\u2019s Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the hearing on December 2 0, 2022,\n1 pertinent excerpts of which follow:  \nI\u2019ll now move on to the second case, InQuisient, Inc., v[.] \nServiceNow, Inc. , Civil Action Number 22-900- CJB.  In th is case,  \nwe again have Defendant \u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Most, though \nnot all, of the motion is premised  on the [ assertion ] that the \noperative complaint should be dismissed on Section 101 eligibility grounds.  I will address only those grounds now, and for reasons I [ \nwill]  explain, I will deny the motion as it relates to Section 101 for \nthe reasons I will now set out today. \n \nPlaintiff asserts in its complaint that Defendant infringes at least Claim 1 of each of  three patents, United States Patent Number  \n7,979,468, which I [ will]  refer to as the '468 [patent] ; United States \nPatent Number 8,219,585, which I [ will]  refer to as the '585 patent; \nand United States Patent Number 8,224,855, which I [ will] refer \n \n1  ( See D.I. 33 (hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d) ) \n3 \n t[o] as the '855 patent.  The three asserted patents share the same \ntitle, \u201cDatabase Data Dictionary. \u201d  The '585 patent and the '855 \npatent are continuations of the '468 patent, and the three patents \nshare the same written description.  \n \nDefendant asserts that Claim 1 of each of  the asserted patents are \nrepresentative of the remainder of the claims in each patent, and  \nPlaintiff does not contest th [at].  Therefore,  the Court will analyze \nonly C laim 1 of each  asserted patent, and because the Court will \ndeny the motion [with] respect to C laim 1 of each of  those patents, \nthe Court will also deny the motion with respect to all claims in the  \nasserted patents.  \n I\u2019ll now turn to the Alice analysis at  Step 1.  Defendant says the \nrepresentative claims are directed to the abstract idea of  \u201cstoring, \nmanaging, indexing, and retrieving data sets based on metadata or descriptions of the data. \u201d\n2  The Court agrees that this is an abstract \nidea.  Indeed, Plaintiff does not really dispute this.  And the [United States Court of Appeals for the] Federal Circuit  has held, \nin cases like Content Extraction [&]  Transmission, LLC, v [.] Wells \nFargo Bank, N[ at\u2019l Ass\u2019n], that the concept of \u201c data collection, \nrecognition, and storage,\u201d a similar concept, was an abstract idea.\n3 \n Plaintiff, for its part, argues that the  claims, though, are not \ndirected to this  abstract idea and that Defendant has  over-\ngeneralized the claims.  According to [P]laintiff, the claims of the asserted patents  are directed to a \u201c data repository with a  specific \nset of interrelated data structures  [(]the modules [)] defining how \nthat structure is  implemented. \u201d\n4  Thus, Plaintiff\u2019s argument goes [,] \nwith the claims purportedly reciting \u201c new data structures that \nimpro ve the operation and efficiency of a database system, \u201d the \nclaims  are not abstract [,] but instead are directed  toward a \ntechnological improvement in database management.5 \n \nIn cases like CardioNet, LLC, v[.] Info [B]ionic, Inc., the Federal \nCircuit has  instructed [c] ourts to be careful to avoid \noversimplifying a claim by looking at it generally and failing to \n \n2  (D.I. 12 at 7) \n \n3  Content Extraction & Transmission LLC, v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat\u2019l Ass \u2019n, 776 \nF.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014).   \n \n4  (D.I. 16 at 12) \n \n5  ( Id.) 4 \n account for its  specific requirements in Step 1.6  For the  reasons I [ \nwill]  discuss now, I think [D]efendant has oversimplified what the \nfocus of the claims  is.  For that reason, the Court finds that \nPlaintiff has the better of the arguments at Step 1. \n Looking first to the claim language itself, Claim 1 of each of the asserted patents  generally claims a computerized system for  \nmanipulating data sets comprised of a processer  and a data \nrepository that processes, retrieves, and stores data contained in the data sets and one or more layers of metadata of  the data in the data  \nsets.\n7  Stopping here, tha t does sound a lot like Defendant \u2019s \nasserted  abstract idea[\u2014t] hat is, storing, managing, indexing, and \nretrieving datasets based on  metadata or descriptions in the data.   \nBut importantly, the claims do not stop  there.  They go on to recite \nwhat it is that makes up the claimed data repo sitories [\u2014t] hat is, \nseveral different modules that are configured to store, identify, define,  generate, and/or transmit various types of information.\n8  \nThese claimed modules constitute  the bulk of the claims, and, as \nPlaintiff  points out, the modules are configured such that they have \nrelationships to one another.9   \n For example, looking to Claim 1 of the '46[8] patent, the claimed data repository contains eight modules.  First, an element  module \nthat[ is] configured to store and uniquely identify a plurality of \nelements.   Second, an element relation module configured to store \none or more relationships between the element and the element module.  Third, a class module configured to define at least one class of the elements and  store the class.   Fourth, an attribute \nmodule configured to define and store one or more attributes.  Fifth, a class attribute module  configured to define and store one or \nmore  class -attribute associations between at least  one of the \nattributes in the class.   Sixth, a type definition module configured \nto define and store one or more types of the class, the attributes related to  the class, and the relationships between the elements.   \nSeventh, a state machine module configured to store one or more state machine types associated with at least one of the  elements.   \n \n6  CardioNet, LLC, v. Info Bionic, Inc., 955 F. 3d 1358, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \n \n7  (D.I. 1, ex. A (hereinafter, \u201c'468 patent\u201d), col. 16:13-19; id., ex. B (hereinafter, \n\u201c'585 patent\u201d), col. 16:19-24; id., ex. C (hereinafter, \u201c '855 patent\u201d), col. 16:22-26) \n \n8  ('468 patent, col. 16:20- 41; '585 patent, col. 16:26-54; '855 patent, col. 16:28-52) \n \n9  (D.I. 16 at 9)   5 \n And eighth, a status module configured to store one or more \nstatuses of each state machine.10 \n \nSo sure, the claims certainly involve the concept of storing, managing, indexing, and retrieving datasets based on metadata or  \ndescriptions of the data [.  B]ut Defendant\u2019s articulation of what the \nclaims are directed to  seems to skim over the modules \nthemselves [\u2014i.e.,] what appears to be the key aspect of  the claims.   \nFor example, on page eight of its opening brief, Defendant stated that the various recited modules \u201cmerely describe groupings of metadata. \u201d\n11  In that regard, it might be that Defendant intended \nthe \u201c based on metadata\u201d aspect of its articulation of the abstract \nidea to appropriately capture the utilization and presence of these various modules.    But if so, Defendant \u2019s description of what the claims are  about still \nseems to be selling the claim [s] short.  Just simply based on the \nmodules \u2019 prominence in the claims and the somewhat intricate way \nin which the modules must interrelate to one another, it seems that the particular nature of the metadata in these modules is not an afterthought  in the claims,  which is what it sounds like in \nDefendant \u2019s articulation of the abstract idea.  Instead,  it[ is] the \nstar of the claims.  In other words, the claim language suggests that \nthe claims are directed to a data repository that, as  Plaintiff points \nout on page 18 of its answering brief, is \u201ccomposed of multiple substructures configured to hold particular information, w hich are \ntied to other claimed  structures in a specified manner. \u201d\n12 \n Defendant also argued at page three of  its reply brief that although \nPlaintiff claims  that the \u201c[relationships\u201d] and \u201c interrelationship [s]\u201d \nof the modules are key to the improvements to  computer \ntechnology advanced by the claims, that, in fact, the patents are \u201csilent\u201d on what the relationships are among the claimed  \nmodules.\n13  But in the Court\u2019s view, that [ is] not true.  The claim \nlimitations, on their face, do not seem to be silent about what are the relationships between the modules.  Instead, the claims tell us how certain modules are related to one another.  For example, the state machine module is configured to store state machine types \n \n10  ('468 patent, col. 16:20-41) \n \n11  (D.I. 12 at 8)   \n \n12  (D.I. 16 at 18) \n \n13  (D.I. 17 at 3) 6 \n associated with at least one o f the elements [\u2014]elements that are \nstored by the element module.14 \n \nThe Court notes that today at oral argument, the parties appeared to \nhave different views about what these claimed  modules really are \nor consist of.  Defendant,  on the one hand, seemed to be suggesting \nthat although the modules facially are required to contain different \ntypes of data, like elements or attributes or state machine types, in  \nreality, they all simply require groupings of merely any type of metadata[.  A]nd Defendant [] suggested that these modules were \nnot actually  part of the data structure, just grouping[s] of data \nthemselves.\n15  But Plaintiff \u2019s counsel argued that the modules, as \ntheir names would appear to suggest, do require utilization of different  types of metadata and that a module is a portion of a data \ntable or a data table itself [\u2014t] hat is, a structure or type of \nstructure.\n16  At this stage of the case, without claim construction \nhaving occurred, Plaintiff\u2019s arguments as to what the claimed modules are seem plaus ible, so I must credit them.  \n \nAt page two of its reply brief, [Defendant] also suggested that the fact that each module is defined by functional language means that the claims amount simply to instructions [to] [\u201c]apply it with a computer [\u201d] in order to carry out the claimed functions.\n17  While it \nis true that the claims dictate that the modules are  configured to \nstore and identify or define certain information, Defendant\u2019 s \nargument ignores that the claims themselves [\u2014]particularly if \nPlaintiff is correct about the previously referenced claim construction issue as to [\u201c] module [\u201d\u2014]would be directed to a new \nsystem  for manipulating datasets that includes particular modules  \nthat must store, identify,  and/or define particular information and \nthat have certain relationships to one another .  The  claims, \ntherefore, would not simply amount to instructions to store, manage, index, and/or retrieve data based on metadata or descriptions of the data on a computer, full stop.  Rather,  they \nwould recite specific data structures for doing so. \n \nNow, the patent specification, though not a model of clarity, also sheds some light on the \u201c directed to \u201d Step 1 inquiry.  For example,  \n \n14  ( See, e.g., '468 patent, col. 16:20-21, 37-39)  \n \n15  (Tr. at 57 -59, 63) \n \n16  ( Id. at 78) \n \n17  (D.I. 17 at 2) 7 \n the abstract explains that the patents claim a  computerized system \nfor \u201cstoring, managing, indexing, interrelating, and/or retrieving \ndata sets in a manner independent of the data model .\u201d18  This \nsuggests that the patents will be  claiming a new system for \nmanaging, indexing, interrelating, and/or retrieving datasets  \n[\u2014t] hat is, one that is independent of the data model.   The abstract \nthen goes on to note how the patent does this [; t]hat is [,] by \nclaiming a system that includes an element module that [ is] \nconfigured to store uniquely identified elements and an element relation module configured to show relationships between the elements and the element module[,] and then by further containing various additional types of modules.  These concepts are, in turn, captured  by the claims.  \n \nTurning to the written description of the asserted patents, column \n1\u2019s background information section explains that at the time  of the \ninvention, a conventional data storage system would implement its own data model according to the system\u2019 s user interface and  \nbusiness r [u]le[s] specification.\n19  These prior art  systems \ndepended on a specific data model, one that the system\u2019 s \ndevelopers create by writing dedicated code.  However, these systems were  said to lack flexibility and portability.\n20  The  section \nends with the patent stating that there  is a \u201cneed for systems and \nmethod[s] that store,  manage, index, interrelate, and/or retrieve \ndata[]sets in a manner independent of the data model .\u201d21  Then in \nthe summary of the invention section, the patent describes the claimed  systems and methods that are s aid to address  this problem \nin some way.  In doing so, the summary section pointedly notes that these  systems and methods are ones containing various \nmodules of the types that are found in the asserted representative \nclaims at issue.\n22 \n Now, candidly, the patent does not, in the Court\u2019s view, understandably articulate how  it is that a claimed system, like those \nin the purportedly representative claims, actually  solve [s] the \nproblems in the prior art that are called out in the background \n \n18  ( See, e.g., '468 patent, Abstract  (emphasis added) )  \n \n19  ( Id., col. 1:20-23) \n \n20  ( Id., col. 1:22-27) \n \n21  ( Id., col. 1:50-52 (emphasis added)) \n \n22  ( See, e.g., id., cols. 1:56-2:12) 8 \n inform ation  section of the patent.  Nor, in the Court\u2019s view, was \nthat answer particularly clear after  reading Plaintiff \u2019s briefing or its \ncurrent  operative complaint.   And despite many questions here \ntoday at oral argument, the Court was left wondering about this \nconnection between what is claimed on the one hand and how what is claimed solves the types of computer- based problems described \nby the patent on the other hand.\n23   \n This lack of clarity, if it continues, may well be harmful to [P]laintiff \u2019s case at some point in the future [.  B]ut it does not \naffect my Step 1 decision here today.  That \u2019s because all I[ am]  \ndoing at Step 1 today is asking myself, first, what is the focus of these claims, and, second, is that concept captured in the abstract idea put forward by  [D]efendant? \n For the reasons that I[ have] explained here today, it is not.  The claim language itself  and the patent specification tell us repeatedly  \nthat the focus of these patent claims is on the particular nature of the data structure at  issue, including its use of particular modules t hat \nstore different types of metadata that are interrelated in a particular way.  Defendant\u2019s abstract idea was simply too broad.  It \noversimplifies the claims, so it doesn \u2019t capture this important \nconcept . \n \nFinally, the caselaw that the parties  highlight as similar to the \nclaims at issue  also helps, at least in part, to demonstrate  that \nPlaintiff \u2019s position appears to be the right one.  For its part, \nDefendant asserted  that the claims here were most analogous to \nthose found to be patent eligible in BSG Tech  LLC v [.] \nBuy[S]easons, Inc.,\n24 a Federal Circuit  case.25  [P]laintiff says that \nits claims were  more similar to the claims found to be patent \neligible in Enfish , LLC, v [.] Microsoft Corp.,26 anothe r Federal \nCircuit case.27  The Court finds that the claims are more like those \nin Enfish than those in BSG Tech., which is another reason why the \ndefendant's motion must be denied at Step 1.  \n \n23  (Tr. at 74-77, 81-84, 88-91) \n \n24  BSG Tech  LLC v . Buy Seasons, Inc., 899 F.3d 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \n \n25  (D.I. 26 at 1- 2)  \n \n26  Enfish , LLC, v . Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2016).   \n \n27  (D.I. 27 at 1) 9 \n In BSG Tech ., the Federal Circuit  affirmed the district court\u2019 s \ndetermination  that the patents at issue were not patent eligible. \nNotably, there, the district court\u2019s decision was issued after the \n[c]ourt accepted  the plaintiff \u2019s proposed claim constructions and \nconverted the [defendant\u2019s] motion to dismiss  into a motion for \nsummary judgment.28  The claims  at issue in that case recited \nmethods and systems for indexing and retrieving data being posted by a plurality of users to a wide area network that entailed, as the claimed advanced  over the prior art, providing the users with \nsummary comparison usage information corresponding to previously used parameters and values for use in posting the data.\n29  \nThe Federal Circuit found that these claims were directed to the \nabstract idea of \u201cconsidering historical usage information while inputting data. \u201d\n30  The Court noted that the patentee did not purport \nto have invented a new database structure.  Rather, the focus of the claims was  guiding users by presenting summary comparison \ninformation to them before they inputted data in order to achieve more consistent item descriptions.\n31  The Federal Circuit reiterated  \nthroughout the opinion that the claimed databases themselves were well known at the time of the inv ention.\n32  While the focus of the \nclaims would improve the quality of the information added to the database, this is not the same as improving the database\u2019s functionality.  Indeed, the database would  serve in its ordinary \ncapacity of storing the resulting  information, and thus the claims \nwere unrelated to how databases function.\n33 \n \nOne claim[ at]  issue in BSG Tech recited a database system, and \nthe patentee pointed to a limitation requiring that users can add  \nadditional parameters without modifying the predefined structure of the database as  constituting an improvement in computer \nfunctionality.\n34  However, the Court explained that the \nspecification said nothing about how to construct such a database \n \n28  BSG Tech  LLC , 899 F.3d at 1285. \n \n29  Id. at 1284. \n \n30  Id. at 1286. \n \n31  Id. \n \n32  Id. at 1286, 1287, 1288. \n \n33  Id. at 1288. \n \n34  Id. at 1289. 10 \n structure, which suggested that this fea ture of the claimed  system \nwas not the focus of the claim.  Moreover, the patent did not \nsuggest that conventional databases required structural modifications to add new param [e]ters.\n35  \n At Step 2  of the Alice test, the BSG Court explained that the only \nalleged unconventional feature of the claims was the requirement that the user be guided by the summary comparison usage information, which, again, simply restated the abstract idea at issue.\n36  As to [the] patentee\u2019s argument there that the claims \nsupplied an inventive concept because they required a specific database structure that did not preempt consideration of usage information  while inputting data into other types of databases, the \nCourt again explained that the claimed specific database structures were well  understood and conventional, and accordingly did not \nsupply an inventive concept.\n37 \n \nSo while in BSG Tech [.] the claimed advance in the patents was \nsimply having users consider certain information while inputting information  into the index, here [,] in contrast [,] the focus of the \nclaims seems to be on a data repository  that includes particular \ndata structures that  have relationships among one another[\u2014t] hat \nis, the particular claimed database structures are  the focus of the \nclaims.  And unlike [in] BSG Tech. , it[ is] not clear [here] that the \nrecited structures were well understood and conventional.  As the Court has previously noted, the patent itself seems to say they were not.  Indeed, the fact that the patentee obtained a patent on these \nclaims  would appear to indicate that they were not. \n \nFor this reason, the Court agrees with [P]laintiff that the claims seem more similar  to those found to be patent eligible in Enfish , \nwhich, again, not for nothing, was [a]  case where the Section 101 \nissue was not decided  until a [] full [er] record was made on \nsummary  judgment.\n38  In Enfish , the Federal Circuit  deemed the \nclaims at issue to be patent eligible because they recited \u201cnon[-]abstract  improvements to [the] computer technology.\u201d\n39  The  \n \n35  Id. \n \n36  Id. at 1291. \n \n37  Id. \n \n38  Enfish , LLC , 822 F.3d at 1330.   \n \n39  Id. at 1335-36. 11 \n Court explained that \u201c[m]uch of the advancement made in \ncomputer technology consist [s] of improvements to software, that, \nby their very nature, may not be defined by particular physical \nfeatures [,] but rather by logical str uctures and processes. \u201d40  The \npatent at issue in Enfish claimed a particular type of logical model for a computer database described as a \u201cself-referential\u201d table.\n41 \nFinding that the focus of the claims was on [a] specific improvement to the way computers operate, the Court emphasized that the claims did not broadly cover any form of storing tabular \ndata, but rather specifically  taught the claim\u2019 s self -referential  \n[table]  for a  computer database.\n42  This specificity was  reflected in \nthe claim language, which described in some detail the table\u2019s attributes, and also in the teaching of the specification.  There, the specification  emphasized how the self -referential table improved \nupon conventional database structures, such as by providing increas ed flexibility,  faster search times, and smaller memory  \nrequirements.   In light of what this demonstrated about the plain \nfocus of the claims [\u2014]that is, that the focus was on an  \nimprovement to computer functionality itself [\u2014]the Enfish Court \nfound the claims passed  Alice \u2019s Step 1 test.\n43 \n \nAs in Enfish , the claims here are directed to data repositories that \nappear to  include specific sets of data structures, that  is, modules, \nthat are configured to store particular kinds of information and that have relationships with one another.   For these reasons, the Court finds that the claims at issue are not directed to the abstract idea put  forward by Defendant.  Therefore, \nDefendant \u2019s motion must be denied. \n \nDefendant \u2019s motion also moves to dismiss  Plaintiff \u2019s claims for \nindirect and willful infringement.\n44  The Court will take that \nportion of the motion under advisement without argument and will issue a forthcoming order on that portion of the motion soon. \n \n40  Id. at 1339. \n \n41  Id. at 1330.   \n \n42  Id. at 1337. \n \n43  Id. at 1339. \n \n44  (D.I. 12 at 17-20) "}
