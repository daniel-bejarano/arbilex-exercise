WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nPlaintiff Affinity Empowering, Inc. (Affinity) brings this action against Defendants \nEurofins Scientific, Inc. (Eurofins) and Clinical Enterprise, Inc. (CEI). In its Complaint (D.I. 2), \nAffinity seeks declaratory judgment as to the scope of a pilot program from the Department of \nDefense and damages for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing. Pending before the Court is CEI' s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter \nJurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim upon Which Relief Can be Granted (D.I. 20). Since the \nCourt finds that Affinity has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate the Court's subject matter \njurisdiction over its claims, the Court will dismiss Affinity's Complaint without prejudice. \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nThis case arises from CEI' s termination of Affinity as a subcontractor on a Department of \nDefense contract to expand COVID-19 testing. In furtherance of his Administration's national \nCOVID-19 response strategy, President Joseph R. Biden issued Executive Order 13,996 on \nJanuary 21, 2021. D.I. 2 ,r,r 1-2; Exec. Order No. 13,996, 86 Fed. Reg. 7197 (Jan. 26, 2021). \nThe Order required various members of the President's cabinet-i.e., the Secretaries of Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Homeland Security-to \"provide support for surveillance \n[COVID-19] tests for settings such as schools .... \" Id. at \u00a7 3(b )(i). \nThe Department of Defense may enter contracts with non-traditional defense contractors \nfor \"prototype projects\" under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022. On February 17, 2021, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services launched \"a partnership with the [Department of Defense] , to make \n1 In a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction , the Court accepts all allegations in the \nComplaint as true. Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 346 (3d Cir. 2016). \n1 a $650 million investment in an experimental pilot program ... authorized by\"\u00a7 4022 that \n\"expands COVID-19 testing opportunitie s for K-8 schools and underserved congregate settings, \nsuch as homeless shelters.\" D.I.214. Government officials envisioned a \"public-private \npartnership \" whereby the government set \"strategic direction\" and the contractors facilitated \nCOVID-19 testing and results reporting . D.I.2142 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nEurofins created CEI as a wholly owned subsidiary and used it to enter the new pilot \nprogram. D.I.2123. However, CEI, Affinity alleges, was Eurofins's alter ego, and Eurofins \ndirected CEI's operations. D.I.2124. \"Affinity is an expert in development and operations of \ncomplex programs in highly regulated environments \" and Affinity had a \"network of molecular \ntesting labs and [a] proprietary state-of-the-art technolog y platform [that] enabled Affinity to \nquickly enter the COVID-19 testing landscape .\" D.I.2120. Eurofins, CEI, and Affinity \n\"developed a joint\" bid to join the pilot program. D.I.2155. \nThe Department of Defense ultimately selected the pilot program proposal that Euro fins, \nCEI, and Affinity developed . D.I. 21 8. In particular , the Department of Defense \"contract[ ed] \nwith CEI/Eurofins to facilitate\" two of the four COVID-19 testing \"Hubs\" that the pilot program \nrequired. D.I.218 . CEI's contract with the government is entitled \"Other Transaction \nAuthority for Prototype Agreement \" and was effective May 25, 2021 (the \"Government \nContract,\" D.I. 2-6). D.I.218; D.I. 2-6. \"CEI/Eurofins , in turn, subcontracted with Affinity to \nimplement the bulk of the work related to those Hubs.\" D.I.218. The Service Agreement , \ndated May 27, 2021, governed the relationship between CEI, as contractor , and Affinity, as \nCEI's subcontractor (the \"Service Agreement ,\" D.I. 2-7). Affinity filed both the Government \nContract and the Service Agreement in this Court under seal. The Service Agreement outlines \nthe services Affinity was required to perform and states that CEI could not \"assign, subcontract , \n2 services directly related to\" the services Affinity was to perform without Affinity's \"prior written \nconsent .... \" D.I. 2-7 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 16, Ex. A. \n\"Affinity invested substantial resources \" in the pilot program \"and successfully \nperformed under the Service Agreement .... \" D.I. 2 ,r 9. \"Yet, effective November 24, 2021 [,] \n... CEI/Eurofins improperly terminated Affinity's subcontract in bad faith .... \" D .I. 2 ,r 11. \nCEI asserted as its grounds for termination that the pilot program \"required Affinity to engage in \ntraditional 'sales' of the free COVID-19 testing capacity ... and to actually perform a certain \nnumber of COVID-19 tests.\" D.I. 2 ,r 12. However, the pilot program imposed no such \nrequirements because all parties involved anticipated that, once \"schools and other underserved \ncongregate settings\" were \"made aware of the free testing capacity[,]\" the demand for testing \nwould follow. D.I. 2 ,r,r 13-16. Thus, Affinity alleges, CEI improperly terminated the Service \nAgreement. Further, prior to termination, CEI reassigned parts of Affinity's role to a third party, \ndespite Affinity's express rejection of CEI's request to do so. D.I. 2 ,r,r 126-30. \nAffinity's claims sound in three counts. In Count I, Affinity seeks \"declaratory judgment \nas to the scope and requirements of [the pilot program] under Executive Order 13,996 ... , the \nDepartment of Defense's\" authority under\u00a7 4022, \"and federal common law.\" D.I. 2 at Count I \n( capitalization altered and emphasis omitted). In Count II, Affinity alleges that CEI breached the \nService Agreement when it reassigned certain services that Affinity was to provide to a third \nparty and \"prematurely and improperly terminated the Service Agreement .... \" D.I. 2 ,r,r 167-\n71, 177. In Count III, Affinity alleges that, despite knowledge to the contrary, CEI \n\"manufacture[ d]\" as grounds for termination of Affinity that the pilot program and the Service \nAgreement required Affinity to engage in \"traditional 'sales[.]\"' D.I. 2 ,r,r 184-85. Thus, \nAffinity alleges, CEI breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \n3 II. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nOnce a court's jurisdiction is challenged , it must presume that it lacks jurisdiction unless \nthe party asserting that jurisdiction exists can prove otherwise . G. W v. Ringwood Bd of Educ., \n28 F.4th 465,468 (3d Cir. 2022). '\"Under [Rule] 12(b)(l), a court must grant a motion to \ndismiss if it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a claim.\"' Shibles v. Bank of Am., NA., 730 \nF. App'x 103, 105 (3d Cir. 2018) (citation omitted) (alteration in original). A motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(l) may be a \"facial\" attack, in which defendants argue that the allegations in \nthe complaint are insufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction, or a \"factual\" attack, in which \ndefendants question the asserted facts underlying federal court jurisdiction. Davis v. Wells \nFargo, 824 F.3d 333,346 (3d Cir. 2016). If a party brings a facial attack, as here, D.I. 21 at 6, \nthe Court must \"'consider the allegations of the complaint as true[,]\"' Davis, 824 F.3d at 346 \n(quoting Petruska v. Gannon Univ., 462 F.3d 294, 302 n.3 (3d Cir. 2006)). \n\"Federal courts have limited jurisdiction .\" Maglioli v. All. HC Holdings LLC, 16 F.4th \n393,413 (3d Cir. 2021). One set of cases federal courts may hear are those that arise under \nfederal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \"[A] case arises under federal law when federal law creates the \ncause of action asserted.\" Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251,257 (2013); see Maglioli, 16 F.4th at \n413 (same). Further, \"[c]laims founded upon federal common law arise under the laws of the \nUnited States and support federal-question jurisdiction. \" E. OH C. v. Sec '.Y United States Dep 't \nof Homeland Sec., 950 F .3d 177, 193 (3d Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). Federal common law displaces state statutes where \"necessary to protect uniquely \nfederal interests,\" Cassirer v. Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Found, 142 S. Ct. 1502, 1509 \n(2022) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and there is shown \"a significant conflict \nbetween some federal policy or interest and the use of state law[,]\" Atherton v. FD.JC, 519 \nU.S. 213,218 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Linan-Faye Const. \n4 Co. v. Haus. Auth. of City of Camden, 49 F.3d 915,920 (3d Cir. 1995) (similar); Rhode Islandv. \nShell Oil Prod. Co., 35 F.4th 44, 54 (1st Cir. 2022) (similar). \nAdditionally , Grable instructs that \"federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a \nfederal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of \nresolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress. \" \nGunn, 568 U.S. at 257 (citing Grable & Sons Metal Prod., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. \n308, 314 (2005)). This test is only met where, \"to prove some element of a state-law claim, the \nplaintiffha[s] to win on an issue of federal law.\" City of Hoboken v. Chevron Corp., 45 F.4th \n699, 709 (3d Cir. 2022). This is a '\"special and small'\" category of cases. Goldman v. Citigroup \nGlob. Markets Inc., 834 F.3d 242,249 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Gunn, 568 U.S. at 258). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nAffinity has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction. Affinity \nargues that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 for three reasons: \nFirst, Affinity has an implied cause of action under Executive Order 13,996 and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n4022. D.I. 26 at 9-11. Second, Affinity's \"claims ... are governed by federal common law.\" \nD.I. 26 at 12-14. Third, Affinity's claims \"necessarily raise a substantial and disputed federal \nissue\" because its claims are based on the pilot program's scope. D.I. 26 at 14-16. However , all \nof Affinity's arguments fail and this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction for the reasons set \nforth more fully below. \nA. Cause of Action Under Federal Law \nAffinity cannot show that it has an implied cause of action under federal law. \nAffinity first asserts that, \"(f]or jurisdictional purposes , the only question is whether \nAffinity has an 'arguable' cause of action under federal law .... \" D .I. 26 at 9-10. CEI does not \nrespond to this argument from Affinity, save in a footnote. D.I. 34 at 1 n.1. \"(A]rguments raised \n5 in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not squarely argued, are considered waived.\" John Wyeth \n& Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'! Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997). Thus, the Court will \nadopt the \"arguable\" standard that Affinity asserts by consent of the parties. \nThe parties agree that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022 does not provide for an express federal cause of \naction. D.I. 21 at 7-8; D.I. 26 at 10. However, Affinity asserts that the statute arguably contains \nan implied cause of action. D.I. 26 at 10. \"[S]ince Congress creates federal causes of action, \nwhere the text of a statute does not provide a cause of action, there ordinarily is no cause of \naction.\" Jaroslawicz v. M&T Bank Corp., 962 F.3d 701, 709 (3d Cir. 2020) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). \"[A]n implied right of action exists if 'a statute ... manifest[s] \nCongress's intent to create (1) a personal right, and (2) a private remedy.\"' Migliori v. Cohen, \n36 F.4th 153, 161 n.48 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting Three Rivers Ctr.for Indep. Living v. Housing \nAuth. of City of Pittsburgh, 382 F.3d 412,421 (3d Cir. 2004)) (alterations in original). Initially, \nthe Court must \"analyze the statute's text and structure to determine whether it contains rights\u00ad\ncreating' language. [The Court] may also look to the legislative history and other indicia of \nlegislative intent.\" Bakos v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 748 F. App'x 468, 473-74 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \"When 'right-or duty-creating language' is not \nexplicitly included in a statute, a court will rarely imply congressional intent to create a private \nright of action.\" Spencer Bank, SL.A. v. Seidman , 309 F. App'x 546, 549 (3d Cir. 2009) \n(quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273,284 n.3 (2002)). \nAffinity argues that this Court should, instead, apply the test outlined in American \nTrucking, D.I. 26 at 10, which, in tum, derives its test from the Supreme Court's decision in Cort \nv. Ash, see Am. Trucking Ass 'n, Inc. v. Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Comm 'n, 458 F.3d 291, \n297 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78 (1975)). However, \"[t]he Supreme \n6 Court's decision in Alexander v. Sandoval , 532 U.S. 275[] ... (2001), strongly suggests that the \nCourt has abandoned the Cort v. Ash test[,]\" and the Third Circuit has rejected the four-part test \nfrom American Trucking. Wisniewski v. Rodale, Inc., 510 F.3d 294, 299-301 (3d Cir. 2007) \n(citation omitted). Thus, the Court will use the two-part test adopted in Sandoval. \nThe Court first finds that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022 does not contain rights-creating language that \nwould evidence Congress 's intent to create a personal right. \"As background , Congress granted \nthe Department of Defense the authority to enter into other transactions ('OT'). OTs are \nagreements that are not procurement contracts , cooperative agreements , or grants.\" Space Exp/. \nTechs. Corp. v. United States, 144 Fed. Cl. 433,435 (2019) (citing, among others, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2371b). Section 4022 allows for such OTs. See id.; William M. (Mac) Thornberry National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Pub. L. No. 116-283, \u00a7 1841, 134 Stat. 3388, \n4243 (2021); National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-81, \u00a7 \n1701, 135 Stat. 1541, 2151 (2021) (transferring\u00a7 2371b to\u00a7 4022 in two steps). Section 4022 \npermits certain officials in the Department of Defense to \ncarry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission \neffectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, \ncomponents, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department \nof Defense, or to improvement of platforms , systems, components , or materials in \nuse by the armed forces. \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022(a)(l ). The statute requires the sign-off of increasingly senior officials for more \nexpensive projects, id. \u00a7 4022(a), directs the government to use \"competitive procedures\" \"[t]o \nthe maximum extent practicable\" when it awards the contracts, id. \u00a7 4022(b )(2), requires that the \nComptroller General be able to access certain information about projects, id. \u00a7 4022( c ), permits \ncontract renewals (i.e., \"follow-on\" contracts) , id. \u00a7 4022(f), applies ethics rules, id. \u00a7 4022(h), \nand permits a contract awardee to provide a prototype to another government contractor , id. \u00a7 \n7 4022(g). The statute also prohibits the Department of Defense from entering a contract for a \nprototype project under \u00a7 4022 unless the project meets one of four conditions ( e.g., \"at least one \nnontraditional defense contractor \" participates ; \"exceptional circumstances justify\" using \nprocedures not \"feasible or appropriate under a contract\"). Id. \u00a7 4022( d)(l ). \nNone of these provisions evidence the intent to create rights or remedies for private \nparties. Rather, the statute allows Department of Defense officials to grant flexible procurement \ncontracts to non-traditional government contractors. The statute also contains no language that \nreferences private remedies for parties. For example, Section 4022 contains no \"comprehensive \nremedial scheme.\" Wisniewski , 510 F.3d at 303. Affinity points to no legislative history that \nwould contradict the statute's plain text, and the Court has not found any. See National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-92, \u00a7 815, 129 Stat. 726, 893 (adding a \nprovision entitled \"authority of the Department of Defense to carry out certain prototype \nprojects\"). Affinity argues that \"certain aspects of[\u00a7 4022] are intended to benefit entities, like \nAffinity, who 'participate[] in the performance of' agreements authorized by that statute.\" D.I. \n26 at 10 (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022(c)-{d)) (alterations in original). However , whether Affinity \nis correct that it could bring suit against a private party to obtain such benefits, Affinity points to \nno particular benefit that the statute offers. Therefore , the Court finds that \u00a7 4022 does not grant \nan implied right of action. \nThe Court next finds that Executive Order 13,996 does not grant it subject matter \njurisdiction. Affinity asserts that the Order is a law for jurisdictional purposes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1331 because the Order states that it is authorized under \"the laws of the United States of \nAmerica.\" D.I. 26 at 11; Exec. Order 13,996, supra. CEI responds that the Order both fails to \ncreate a private right of action and does not constitute federal law for purposes of \u00a7 13 31. D .I. \n8 34 at 5. Section 1331 grants this Court jurisdiction over \"civil actions arising under the ... laws, \n... of the United States.\" This includes executive orders \"designed to implement and effectuate \nthe statutes under which they were promulgated .... \" Loe. 1498, Am. Fed'n ofGov't Emp. v. \nAm. Fed'n ofGov't Emp., AFVCIO, 522 F.2d 486,491 (3d Cir. 1975); see also Chasse v. \nChasen, 595 F.2d 59, 61-62 (1st Cir. 1979) (explaining that \"validly issued administrative \nregulations or executive orders may be treated as 'laws of the United States' under\u00a7 1331(a)\" \nafter the court weighs \"the statutory authority for promulgation\" and \"the formality of the \npromulgation\") ; Terry v. Northrup Worldwide Aircraft Servs., Inc., 786 F.2d 1558, 1560 (11th \nCir. 1986) (asking whether the executive order \"'was entered into pursuant to authority conferred \nby federal statute\"' (citation omitted)) ; Kuhn v. Nat'! Ass'n of Letter Carriers, Branch 5,570 \nF.2d 757, 761 (8th Cir. 1978) (\"[P]residential proclamations and orders have the force and effect \nof law when issued pursuant to a statutory mandate or delegation of authority from Congress. \" \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)) . \nExecutive Order 13,996 cites only one statute for its authority , 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 301. Affinity \npoints to no other statute from which the Order derives its authority. D.I. 26 at 11. Section 301 \nprovides that the President \"is authorized to designate and empower\" various federal officials \n\"appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" \"to perform without approval ... \nany function which is vested in the President by law\" or any function that requires presidential \napproval. 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 301. Executive Order 13,996, for its part, establishes a \"COVID-19 \nPandemic Testing Board\" and directs various senior officials to \"facilitate the provision of \nCOVID-19 testing free of charge to those who lack comprehensive insurance coverage\" and to \n\"provide support for surveillance tests for settings such as schools .... \" Exec. Order No. \n13,996, supra,\u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. The Complaint alleges that the Departments of Defense and of Health \n9 and Human Services launched \"an experimental pilot program ... authorized by\" \u00a7 4022 that \n\"expands COVID-19 testing opportunities for K-8 schools and underserved congregate settings, \nsuch as homeless shelters.\" D.I. 2, 4. Affinity participated in the pilot program as part of \n\"Team Eurofins\" and entered into the Service Agreement \"[i]n connection with\" the Government \nContract. D.I. 2, 8, 55, 65, 76--78; D.I. 2-7 \u00a7 1. The designs of Executive Order 13,996 and of \nthe pilot program do not suggest an attempt to implement or effectuate\u00a7 301. In other words, \n\u00a7 301 permitted Executive Order 13,996's adoption, but the Order did not further\u00a7 301 's \nimplementation (e.g., it did not outline rules for permissible delegations under\u00a7 301). As such, \nthe Order does not grant federal question jurisdiction under\u00a7 1331. \nAffinity has failed to meet its burden to show that either \u00a7 4022 or Executive Order \n13,996 grants this Court subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \nB. Federal Common Law \nThis action also does not arise under federal common law. \"[B]ecause federal common \nlaw is federal law, disputes governed by it arise under the laws of the United States.\" E. OH C., \n950 F.3d at 192 (cleaned up). Federal common law exists in \"limited areas\" where \"the rule is \nnecessary to protect uniquely federal interests[,]\" Matrix Distributors , Inc. v. Nat'! Ass 'n of \nBoards of Pharmacy, 34 F.4th 190, 197 (3d Cir. 2022) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted), or where \"substantial rights or duties of the United States hinge on [an action's] \noutcome[,]\" Miree v. DeKalb Cnty., Ga., 433 U.S. 25, 31 (1977). One example is \"cases \nconcerned with the rights and obligations of the United States\" such as \"when the United States \nis a party to a contract .... \" E. OH C., 950 F .3d at 192 (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). Further, federal common law only applies where \"a significant conflict exists between \nan identifiable federal policy or interest and the operation of state law .... \" Boyle v. United \nTechs. Corp., 487 U.S. 500,507 (1988) (cleaned up); see also Atherton, 519 U.S. at 218. \n10 Affinity asserts that \"(t]his case arises in one of those rare, uniquely federal areas-a vital \nfederal program created to combat a nationwide , once-in-a-lifetime pandemic\" and that \n\"(a]pplying state law to Affinity's claims would seriously undermine federal interests in \nuniformity, predictability, and the supremacy of the federal interest.\" D.I. 26 at 12. Affinity \nargues that determining whether the Government Contract \"obligated Affinity to perform in the \nway CEI[] wrongly claims it did will necessarily impact how [the Government Contract] is \ninterpreted.\" D.I. 26 at 13. Additionally, Affinity raises the specter of \"[d]ivergent state court \ninterpretations\" that could \"undermine the National Strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic \n.... \" D.I. 26 at 13-14. The Ninth Circuit, as Affinity points out, D.I. 26 at 12, has held that \nfederal common law governs contract disputes over a subcontract between private parties to a \ngovernment contract, see New SD, Inc. v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 79 F.3d 953, 955 (9th Cir. 1996). \nHowever , other courts have rejected the Ninth Circuit's analysis as overbroad and instead found \nthat a subcontract must implicate government rights or interests--or expose the government to \n\"some potential loss\"-for federal common law to apply. See Woodward Governor Co. v. \nCurtiss Wright Flight Sys., Inc., 164 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 1999). \nThe Court finds Affinity's arguments unavailing . First, if the Department of Defense \ndisagreed with state courts' interpretations of the Government Contract, the Department could \nsimply revise the offending language and renew or reissue the contract on more agreeable terms. \nThus, inconsistent state court interpretation presents little risk to the federal government as to \nother or future agreements. Second, states' shared interest in the pandemic's containment shows \nthat federal interests are far from \"unique\u008f.\" See, e.g., Delaware 's COVID-19 Response , Del. \nDiv. Pub. Health (Accessed Sept. 22, 2022), https://coronavirus.delaware.gov /; Seventh \nExtension of Declaration of a Public Health Emergency for the State of Delaware , Del. Exec. \n11 Dept. (Sept. 15, 2022), https://govemor.delaware.go v/wp\u00ad\ncontent/uploads /sites/24/2022/09/Seventh-Extension-of-PHE _9 .15 .22 _ Signed. pdf ( extending \nDelaware's COVID-19 public health emergenc y). Third, Affinity asserts no conflict between \nstate law and federal common law as it pertains to Affinity's claims. Indeed, the Service \nAgreement at issue selects both Delaware law and applicable provisions of federal law. D.I. 2-7 \n\u00a7 19. In other words, the parties anticipated resolution of at least some disputes related to the \nService Agreement to occur under Delaware law. Therefore , Affinity has failed to meet is \nburden to show that its claims arise under federal common law. \nC. State Law Grable Claims \nFinally, Affinity cannot meet its burden to show that this is one of the \"'special and \nsmall\"' number of cases that arises exclusively under state law that federal courts will still hear. \nGoldman , 834 F.3d at 249 (quoting Gunn, 568 U.S. at 258). The Supreme Court has instructed , \nunder the test articulated in Grable, that \"federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a \nfederal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial , and (4) capable of \nresolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress .\" \nGunn, 568 U.S. at 257 (citing Grable & Sons Metal Prod., 545 U.S. at 314). Proof of an element \nof the state law claim must tum on federal law, City of Hoboken , 45 F.4th at 709, and the case \nmust raise an issue substantial \"to the federal system as a whole[,]\" Gunn, 568 U.S. at 260. \nHere, the Court does not find for Affinity as to either Count II, breach of contract, or Count III, \nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, under Grable. \nTo begin, \"[t]he Declaratory Judgment Act does not ... provide an independent basis for \nsubject-matter jurisdiction ; it merely defines a remedy.\" Allen v. DeBello, 861 F.3d 433, 444 (3d \nCir. 2017) (footnote omitted). Affinity brings Count I under Executive Order 13,996, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4022, and federal common law. See D.I. 2 at Count I. Since the Court has found it lacks \n12 jurisdiction under Executive Order 13,996, \u00a7 4022, and federal common law, see supra, the \nCourt has no jurisdiction as to Count I and will only apply Grable to Count II and Count III. \nAffinity argues that Count II and Count III necessarily raise a disputed federal issue \nbecause \"[t]he primary question in all of Affinity's claims relates to the requirements of' the \npilot program. D.I. 26 at 14. However, Affinity's breach of contract claim, Count II, mentions \nthe pilot program only to state (i) the \"intent\" of the parties when they entered the Service \nAgreement and (ii) that the Service Agreement was to last as long as the Government Contract \nlasted. D.I.211164, 174-75. Otherwise , Affinity alleges only the breach of \"the plain language \nof the Service Agreement .... \" D.I.211165 , 174. \"[T]he interpretation of private contracts is \nordinarily a question of state law .... \" Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trustees of Leland Stanford \nJunior Univ., 489 U.S. 468,474 (1989). Thus, Count II does not \"necessarily raise\" an issue of \nfederal law, much less a disputed issue. \nCount III alleges that, while neither the pilot project nor the Service Agreement \"require \ntraditional 'sales,' as opposed to marketing and outreach[ ,]\" CEI knowingly used Affinity's \nfailure to make sales as a \"manufacture[d] purported grounds for termination for cause\" of the \nService Agreement. D.I.21185. A claim only falls under Grable if, \"to prove some element of \na state-law claim, the plaintiff had to win on an issue of federal law.\" City of Hoboken, 45 F.4th \nat 709 (emphasis in original); see also Grable, 545 U.S. at 314-15 (noting that an \"essential \nelement\" of Grable' s state law claim was whether he received the notice that federal law \nrequires). Here, the Government Contract specifies CEI's obligations within the pilot project, \nsee, e.g., D.I. 2-6 \u00a7 C. l .d. (\"[CEI] shall carry out the Prototype Project in accordance with the \nStatement of Work, attached as Appendix A.\"); id. at App'x Al, A2 (outlining, e.g., \ncoordination , laboratory network, and schedule requirements) , and the Service Agreement \n13 applies only to Affinity's provision of services \"related to specimens collected and prepared for \ntesting pursuant to the [Government Contract,]\" D.I. 2-7 at 1. Since Count III turns on whether \n\"Affinity was required to engage in sales[,]\" D.I. 2 ,r 185, the Court finds it likely that Count III \nwill also turn on contract interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the Service Agreement and of the \nGovernment Contract) and, therefore , is unlikely to raise a disputed federal issue. \nHowever , even if Affinity raises a federal issue, the issue is not substantial. Affinity \nexplains that this case presents a substantial federal issue because its resolution would require \nthat the Court \"prob[ e] the judgments of federal executive officers\" and \"examin[ e] the scope of \nthe federal government 's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \" D.I. 26 at 15. First, Count II \nasserts breach of the Service Agreement and Count III is based upon CEI' s knowledge of the \nGovernment Contract's requirements. D.I. 2 at Count II, Count III. If the two contracts impose \nclear and unambiguous requirements , the Court would not need to consider extrinsic evidence at \nall. See Cox Commc'ns, Inc. v. T-Mobile US, Inc., 2022 WL 619700, at *5 (Del. Mar. 3, 2022) \n(\"[Delaware 's] approach places great weight on the plain terms of a disputed contractual \nprovision .... \"). Even if the Court had to resort to extrinsic evidence, the extrinsic evidence \nwould likely come from the parties, since Count II relates only to breach of a contract between \nthe parties and Count III may require investigating CEI's (not the Department of Defense's) state \nof mind. Finally, the Complaint clarifies that Executive Order 13,996 was only one out of\"a \nnumber of Executive Orders\" issued to combat the pandemic , D.I. 2 ,r 2, and the pilot program \ntargeted only one or two of at least seven goals that Executive Order 13,996, alone, pursued, \nExec. Order No. 13,996, supra,\u00a7 1. Even if the entire national strategy to combat COVID-19 \nwere important to \"the federal system as a whole[,]\" Gunn, 568 U.S. at 260, it is unclear why this \nsmall portion of it would be. Therefore , Affinity raises no substantial federal issue. \n14 Finally, Affinity argues that the federal-state balance would not suffer disruption because \na case related to \"a new and unprecedented federal program that state courts have never been \ninvolved with\" is \"unlikely to occur very often.\" D.I. 26 at 16. However , Affinity ignores that \nDelaware has an interest in the interpretation of the Service Agreement , since it invokes \nDelaware law. See D.I. 2-7 \u00a7 19. See generally lllinois Nat. Ins. Co. v. Wyndham Worldwide \nOperations , Inc., 653 F.3d 225,231 (3d Cir. 2011) (\"When interpreting state law, we follow a \nstate's highest court .... \"). Second, it is hardly rare that federal programs are called \"new and \nunprecedented.\" See, e.g., Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, Off. \nElementary & Secondary Ed. (July 21, 2022), https://oese.ed.gov /offices/education-stabilization\u00ad\nfund/ elementary-secondary-school-emergency-relief-fund/ ( noting corona virus relief bill's \n\"unprecedented $1.9 trillion package of assistance measures \"); Eiden-Harris Administration , \nUSDOT Make an Unprecedented $1.4 Billion in Rail Grants Available Through Bipartisan \nInfrastructure Law, U.S. Dept. of Transportation (Sept. 1, 2022), \nhttps://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-usdot-make\u00ad\nunprecedented-14-billion-rail-grants-available ; Trump Administration Accomplishments , Trump \nWhite House (Jan. 2021), https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov /trump-administration\u00ad\naccomplishments / (listing ''unprecedented reforms\" related to \"prescription drugs\"; \n\"[u]nprecedented support for law-enforcement\" ; \"unprecedented transparency in Medicare and \nMedicaid data\"; and \"unprecedented attention and support to combat the opioid crisis\"). Thus, \nthe Court cannot accept Affinity's assertion that similar requests to assert federal jurisdiction \nover classic state law contract claims would be \"rare.\" \nTherefore, Count II and Count III fail the Grable test. \n* * * \n15 In summary , Affinity has the burden of proof to show jurisdiction , and Affinity has failed \nto meet that burden. The Court finds that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4022 does not create a private right of \naction; that Executive Order 13,996 was not designed to implement\u00a7 4022 or 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 301; \nthat federal common law does not govern Affinity's claims; and that Affinity cannot invoke this \nCourt's jurisdiction under Grable for Affinity's state law claims. Thus, Affinity has failed to \nmeet its burden to establish this Court's jurisdiction , and the Court will dismiss Count I, Count \nII, and Count III for lack of subject matter jurisdiction . \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court will grant CEI's motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction without prejudice . In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\" Prod Liab. Litig., \n132 F.3d 152, 155 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding that the \"disposition \" of\"a case, over which the court \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction , ... will, however, be without prejudice \" (citations omitted)); \nsee Patel v. Allstate New Jersey Ins. Co., 648 F. App'x 258, 262-63 (3d Cir. 2016) (vacating \ndismissal with prejudice because court lacked jurisdiction to decide merits). \nThe Court will enter an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n16 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAFFINITY EMPOWERING , Inc., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nEUROFINS SCIENTIFIC , Inc., \nCLINICAL ENTERPRISE , Inc. \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 21-1843-GBW \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 11th day of October, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion \nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \n1.
