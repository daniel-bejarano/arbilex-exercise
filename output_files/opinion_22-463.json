BACKGROUND\nThis action arises from the denial of Me lissa Ann Margis\u2019s (\u201cplaintiff\u201d) claim for\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (\u201cDIB\u201d) benefits under Title II of the Social Security\nAct (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433.\n4  Plaintiff protectively filed her benefits application\n1 Following the parties\u2019 consent to proc eed before a magistrate judge, this judge\nwas assigned to conduct all proceedings and or der the entry of a final judgment in\naccordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) and F ED.

LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Motion for Summary Judgment\nIn determining the appropriateness of su mmary judgment, the court must \u201creview\nthe record as a whole, \u2018draw[ing] all reas onable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\nparty[,]\u2019 but [refraining from] weighi ng the evidence or making credibility\ndeterminations.\u201d15  If no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment is appropriate.16 \nThis standard does not change merely because there are cross-motions for\nsummary judgment.17  Cross-motions for summary judgment:\nare no more than a claim by each side that it alone is entitled to summary\njudgment, and the making of such inherent ly contradictory claims does not\nconstitute an agreement that if one is  rejected the other is necessarily\njustified or that the losing party waives judicial consideration and\ndetermination whether genuine issues  of material fact exist.18\n\u201cThe filing of cross-motions for summary judgment does not require the court to\ngrant summary judgment for either party.\u201d19\nB. Court\u2019s Review of the ALJ\u2019s Findings\nThe Commissioner must follow a five-step sequential analysis when determining\nif an individual is disabled.20  The Commissioner must determine whether the applicant: \n(1) is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a \u201csevere\u201d medical impairment; (3)\n15 Reeves v.

Under the substantial-evidence standar d, a court looks to an existing\nadministrative record and asks whether it contains \u201csufficien[t] evidence\u201dto support the agency's factual determinations.  And whatever themeaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d in other contexts, the threshold for such\nevidentiary sufficiency is not high. Substantial evidence, this Court hassaid, is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla.\u201d\n24\nIn reviewing whether substantial evidenc e supports the Commissioner's findings, the\ncourt may not \u201cre-weigh the evidence or impose [its] own factual determinations.\u201d25  The\nreviewing court must defer to the ALJ and affirm the Commissioner's decision, even if it\nwould have decided the factual inquiry differently, so long as substantial evidencesupports the decision.\n26\nThe reviewing court must also review the ALJ's decision to determine whether\n21 McCrea v.

DISCUSSION\nThe ALJ found plaintiff had the following se vere impairments:  major depressive\ndisorder; persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress; attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d); cervical  degenerative disc disease (\u201cDDD\u201d); cervical\nradiculopathy; and obesity.29  The ALJ found plaintiff\u2019s hypothyroidism, Reynaud\u2019s, and\nfibromyalgia were not \u201csevere\u201d impai rments as defined in the regulations.30  The ALJ\nposed to the VE two base hypothetical questions and several follow up questions.  First,she asked the following hypothetical question to the VE:\n[A]ssume an individual who is able to perform light work, occasionally\nclimb ramps and stairs, but never c limb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds. \nOccasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, tolerate occasionalexposure to extreme heat, extreme cold , humidity, wetness, fumes, odors,\ndust, gasses, poor ventilation, and vibrations, and who cannot tolerateexposure to hazards, such as moving machinery or unprotected heights. \nPlease assume that the individual can finger, handle, and reach no morethan frequently, and is able to perform no more than simple, routine,repetitive tasks, and can tolerate no more than few changes in a routinework setting.  Would such an individual be able to perform the Claimant'spast work?\n31\nThe VE responded the hypothetical person could not.32  The ALJ then asked if\nthere would be any jobs that person could perform.33  The VE responded such person\n27 Sykes v. Apfel , 228 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir. 2000).\n28 Id.\n29 Tr. at 12.\n30 Id. at 12-13.\n31 Id. at 54.\n32 Id.\n33 Id. at 55.\n5would be able to perform jobs at the light ex ertional level including:  inspector, general\noffice helper, and router.34\nThe ALJ posed a second hypothetical question to the VE:[A]ssume all the limitations I've listed, including the simple, routine,\nrepetitive, and few changes in a routine work setting. . . .  [P]lease assumethis individual is at the sedentary exertional level.  Would such an\nindividual be able to perform the Claimant' s past work?\n35\nThe VE again responded the hypothetical person could not.36  The ALJ then\nasked if there were any other jobs in the national economy that could be consistent with\nall of the limitations in  the second hypothetical.37  The VE responded such person would\nbe able to perform jobs at the sedentary exertional  level including:  taper, printed circuit\nboards, addresser, and final assembler.38\nThe ALJ then asked the VE:Thinking about the limitations I've listed in base Hypothetical 1 and base\nHypothetical 2, along with the corre sponding jobs you listed for each of\nthose two base hypotheticals in the national economy, if in addition toeach of those hypotheticals the individual were not able to work at aproduction pace, so in other words, no assembly line type of work, wouldthat impact your response regarding any of the light or sedentary jobs\nyou've listed in the national economy?\n39\nThe VE responded that none of the light or s edentary jobs she identified are production\npaced jobs, but do have productivity requirements.40\nNext, the ALJ asked:\n34 Id.\n35 Id.\n36 Id.\n37 Id. at 56.\n38 Id.\n39 Id.\n40 Id. at 57.\n6If in addition to the limitations I\u2019ve listed in each of those two base\nhypotheticals, the individual were able to interact with supervisors and co-workers no more than frequently while working in tandem with or directly\nwith others no more than occasionally, and . . . interacting with the publicno more than occasionally.  Would that impact your response regardingany of the light or sedentary jobs you've listed in the national economy?\n41\nThe VE stated that the identifi ed-jobs, \u201ctypically do not require any public contact. The\ninteraction with supervisors and co-workers would not be more than frequent for these\ntype of jobs.  And these jobs are typically  not done in tandem with others.  It would be in\nproximity of your co-worke r, but not in tandem with.\u201d42\nFinally, the ALJ asked:\n[I]f in addition to the limitations I\u2019ve listed in each of the two base\nhypotheticals, the individual requir ed the opportunity to move from a\nseated position to a standing position, or vice-a-verse, for up to fiveminutes throughout every hour, remain ing on task.  Would that impact\nyour response regarding the jobs y ou\u2019ve listed at light or sedentary?\n43\nThe VE confirmed that \u201c[i]f they\u2019re changing positions for five minutes every hour, but\nremaining on task, the jobs I identified would be available.\u201d44\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel then posed questions  to the VE regarding an employer\u2019s\ntolerance for off task behavior and absences.45  The VE responded that either 15% or\nmore lost productivity, or missing one or more days per month over time, would\npreclude employment.46\nIn her decision, the ALJ stated:\n41 Id.\n42 Id.\n43 Id.\n44 Id.\n45 Id. at 58.\n46 Id.\n7After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that\nthe claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work asdefined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except o ccasionally climb ramps, stairs,\nladders, ropes, scaffolds; occasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch andcrawl; tolerate occasional exposur e to extreme heat, extreme cold,\nhumidity, wetness, fumes, odors, dus t, gases, poor ventilation, vibrations\nand hazards such as moving machinery and unprotected heights; canfinger, handle and reach no more than frequently; can perform simple,routine, repetitive tasks, and can tole rate few changes in a routine work\nsetting; can interact with co-workers and supervisors frequently, whileworking in tandem with others occasionally, and can interact with thepublic occasionally.\n47\n* * * * *\nAfter careful consideration of the evidence, the undersigned finds that the\nclaimant's medically determinabl e impairments could reasonably be\nexpected to cause the alleged sym ptoms; however, the claimant's\nstatements concerning t he intensity, persistenc e and limiting effects of\nthese symptoms are not entirely consis tent with the medical evidence and\nother evidence in the record for the reasons explained in this decision.48\nThe ALJ relied upon the VE\u2019s assessments in her final determination and\nconcluded, considering plaintiff\u2019s age, educat ion, work experience, and RFC, she was\ncapable of making a successful adjustment to other work that existed in significant\nnumbers in the national economy, such as in spector, general office helper, and router.49\nPlaintiff argues substantial evidence does  not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that\nshe has the capacity to perform light work because the ALJ failed to properly evaluatethe medical opinion evidence consistent with Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d)\npolicy and Third Circuit precedent.\n50  She also contends the ALJ\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d finding\nwas generally defective for the same reasons, but also for failing to consider her\n47 Id. at 14-15.\n48 Id. at 18.\n49 Id. at 23.\n50 D.I. 12 at 1, 2-16.\n8exemplary work history.51  Plaintiff contends the opinions of her treating medical\nprofessionals Alfred Fletcher, M.D. (\u201cDr. Fl etcher\u201d), Jeffrey Vari, PT, DPT, MBA (\u201cPT\nVari\u201d), and Ranga N. Ram, M.D. (\u201cDr. Ram\u201d)52 each \u201c(1) describe far greater and more\ndetailed limitations than are accounted fo r in the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding; and (2) met\nPlaintiff\u2019s burden to produce evidence establis hing that she is \u2018disabled\u2019 pursuant to\nSSA\u2019s definition.\u201d53  Plaintiff asserts \u201cthe treating and examining opinions are consistent\nwith and supported by the record, and the ALJ di d not reasonably or logically find to the\ncontrary.\u201d54\nDefendant asserts substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of the\nmedical opinion evidence under the new controlling regulatory scheme, and she\ncomplied with SSA regulations and policy w hen considering plaintiff\u2019s subjective\ncomplaints.55\nPlaintiff was treated by Dr. Fletcher, PT Vari, and Dr. Ram during her alleged\nperiod of disability.  Each submitted opinions, inter alia , that her physical and/or mental\nimpairments would prevent her from maintaining full time employment.56  If those\nopinions were accepted, plaintiff would be di sabled.  \u201c[I]t is well established,\u201d however,\n51 Id. at 1-2, 16-18.\n52 Dr. Fletcher is plaintiff\u2019s primary ca re physician, PT Vari is her physical\ntherapist, and Dr. Ram is her treating psychiatrist.

Bloch of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.  As\nhere, the plaintiff argued:  \u201cif the ALJ has found multiple opinions to be persuasive, he or\nshe then \u2018break[s] the tie\u2019  by applying the factors set forth in Section[]  404.1520c(b)(3)\n. . . \u2013relationship with the claimant, specia lization, and other factors\u2013to determine which\nof the \u2018persuasive\u2019 opinions is most persuasive.\u201d79  Judge Bloch rejected this argument\nand cogently explained:\nIn essence, Plaintiff is contending that the ALJ first makes the binary\ndecision of whether an opinion is pers uasive or not persuasive by applying\nthe two \u201cmost important factors\u201d of supportability and consistency, and\nthen applies the remaining factors to separately \u201crank\u201d the opinions in theorder of persuasiveness.  This is si mply not consistent with the language\nof the regulations.\nSection[] 404.1520c(b) . . . provide[s]:  \u201cWe will articulate in our\ndetermination or decision how persuasive we find all of the medicalopinions and all of the prior administr ative medical findings in your case\nrecord.\u201d  ALJs, therefore, do not simply determine whether  an opinion is\npersuasive or not, but rather how persuasive it is.  This very clearly\ncontemplates a spectrum of pers uasiveness and not merely a \u201cthumbs up\u201d\nor \u201cthumbs down\u201d on whether an opi nion is persuasive.  Moreover,\nsection[] 404.1520c(b) . . . expressly state[s] that supportability and\nconsistency \u201care the most import ant factors we consider when we\ndetermine how persuasive we find a medical source's medical opinions or\nprior administrative medical findings to be.\u201d  (emphasis added).

In the event that two or more\nopinions regarding the same iss ue are \u201cequally\u201d well-supported and\nconsistent with the record, then a more focused analysis of the remainingfactors is warranted.

Again, the\nregulations do not state that if tw o or more opinions are supported and\nconsistent with the record that this  additional analysis will be triggered, but\nonly if they are equally  supported and consistent.

(underlining added, bold in original).  The analysis in Skirble  is not\ncontradicted by the Knecht  opinion cited by plaintiff as support for his two-step \u201cbreak\nthe tie\u201d argument.

She thoughtfully\nexplained how plaintiff\u2019s reasonably supported limitations were accounted for in her\nRFC, and the reasons plaintiff\u2019s allegedly gr eater disabling limitations were rejected.\nPlaintiff alleged disability beginning Oc tober 1, 2017 \u201cbased on progressively\nworsening pain and anxiety.\u201d81  The ALJ noted her testimony of feeling lonely and\nisolated, the side effects of her medicati on (including weight gain, blisters, memory\nproblems, drowsiness, and suicidal thoughts) , and of suffering insomnia and continuous\nuse of heat or ice packs for pain.82  \nThe ALJ found plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmedically determinable impairments could reasonably\nbe expected to cause the alleged symptoms[.]\u201d83  She determined, however, that\n\u201cplaintiff\u2019s statements concerning the intensit y, persistence and limiting effects of these\nsymptoms are not entirely c onsistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in\nthe record[.]\u201d84\nThe ALJ found the record reflected no signi ficant changes in plaintiff\u2019s physical or\nmental impairments around her stated Oct ober 17, 2021 onset date, but noted she\nstopped working because her employer closed its Delaware facility in 2017.85  The ALJ\n81 Tr. at 15.\n82 Id. at 13-15.\n83 Id. at 18\n84 Id.\n85 Id.

The court rejects plai ntiff\u2019s argument that the ALJ\u2019s\ncredibility determination was deficient for pur portedly neglecting to consider plaintiff\u2019s\nwork history.  The ALJ noted plainti ff stopped working in 2017 because her employer\nclosed its Delaware office, and that there was no evidence of changes to plaintiff\u2019simpairments coincident with the end of her em ployment.  This court has affirmed an\nALJ\u2019s decision where a disability claimant wit h an extensive work history was laid off. \n15found evidence from Dr. Ram and a consulta tive examination regarding plaintiff\u2019s\nunderstanding, remembering, or applying info rmation as supporting no more than a mild\nlimitation.86  Psychotherapy records supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that her\ninteraction with others is moderately limited.87  Plaintiff\u2019s concentration, persisting, or\nmaintaining pace were moderately limited based on the ALJ\u2019s consideration of her\ntestimony that she has difficulty concent rating, her ADHD diagnosis, and consultative\nexamination.88  The ALJ found plaintiff only mild ly limited with regard to adapting or\nmanaging herself based on her reporting at a cons ultative examination that she dresses\nand bathes without assistance, drove to  the exam, and occasionally shops, does\nlaundry and washes dishes.89\nThe ALJ also found the medical records do not support plaintiff\u2019s alleged degree\nof functional limitation.  She separately discussed the record describing plaintiff\u2019s\ndepression and ADHD, and her cervical DDD, cervical radiculopathy, and obesity.90\nThe ALJ found plaintiff\u2019s \u201cstatements about the intensity, persi stence, and limiting\neffects of her symptoms[] . . . incons istent with the evidence of record.\u201d91  The record\nSee Milliman v.

(citing id., Ex. 17F/4-8).\n96 Id.\n17Lastly, the ALJ discussed the medical opi nions and prior administrative findings\nby first discussing plaintiff\u2019s mental impairment s.  Dr. Ram opined that plaintiff could not\nperform simple, routine, repetitive work forty hours per week without missing two of\nmore days a month, her inability to remain on task 80% of a workday, and that she hasa moderate severe to severe degr ee of impairments in all areas.\n97  The ALJ found Dr.\nRam\u2019s opinions were not persuasive because there were not supported by his treatment\nnotes.  Those notes do not show a signifi cant change in mental health symptoms or\nlimitations as of the alleged onset date; instead, they show plaintiff\u2019s continued\nmanagement with outpatient p sychotherapy and medication.98  Dr. Ram\u2019s opinions were\nalso found inconsistent with the consulta tive examination and prior administrative\nmedical findings which recorded plaintiff hav ing fair attention, concentration, and\nshort-term memory, and dysthymic mood, but she was able to make good eye contact,having good memory for immediate material, and denial of any difficulties getting along\nwell with others.\n99  Additionally, plaintiff continues to drive, shop, and perform some\nhousehold chores.100\nIn contrast, ALJ found persuasive the opini on of the consultative examiner that\nplaintiff was moderately impaired as to \u201crestri ction of daily activities, deterioration of\npersonal habits, ability to carry out instru ctions under ordinary supervision, cope with\npressures of ordinary work, and perform routine, repetitive tasks under ordinary\n97 Id.

(citing id., Ex. 7F).\n18supervision.\u201d101  That degree of impairment was s upported by the exam findings listed\nabove, including good eye contact, fa ir attention, concentration, inter alia.102  A State\nagency psychological consultant\u2019s findings, subsequently affirmed by anotherconsultant, that plaintiff was only moderately limited in her ability to maintain attention\nand concentration for extended periods was also determined by the ALJ to bepersuasive.\n103  The consultative examiner report ed plaintiff as having \u201cfair attention,\nconcentration, and short-term memory, and . . . [to be] capable of interactingappropriately with others, performing simple  tasks, and avoiding hazards at work.\u201d\n104 \nThe ALJ determined those findings were s upported by explanation and consistent with\nthe medical evidence of record.105\nTurning to plaintiff\u2019s physical impairment s, the ALJ found Dr. Fletcher\u2019s opinion\nthat plaintiff\u2019s back and neck pain limiting her to standing twenty minutes at one time\nand three hours total, and sitting for twenty mi nutes at one time and three to four hours\ntotal, precluded her from working eight hour s per day at sedentary or light exertional\nlevel not persuasive as unsupported by his own reports.106  Specifically, the ALJ noted\nthat on December 11, 2018, Dr. Fletc her noted neck inspection with only mild\ntenderness, and no gross motor or sensory def icits, and that in August 2019 Fletcher\u2019s\n101 Id. at 19-20 (citing id., Ex. 7F/5-6).\n102 Id. at 20 (citing id., Ex. 7F/3).  The ALJ determined the medical evidence of\nrecord did not support the assessment of moderatel y severe impairment or limiting\nplaintiff to simple work related decisions , based on limited mental health treatment and\nfindings of relative stability during the period at issue.

(citing id., Ex. 14F).\n19notes did not mention any fatigue or tender \u201ctrigger points\u201d that had been reflected in\nnotes from and  intervening appointment.107  The ALJ also pointed out more recent\nrheumatology records observed normal neck range of motion, gait, and sensory exam;\nas well as grossly intact motor exam.108\nThe ALJ also rejected as not persuasive PT Vari\u2019s opinion that plaintiff lacks the\nphysical ability to work in most sedentary occupations because she could only perform\nsedentary work for two hours.109  Dr. Fletcher rheumatologist Sheerin Javed, MD.\nreviewed the report and agreed to the functional status.110 The ALJ rejected PT Vari\u2019s\nopinion as unsupported and inconsistent with the more recent rheumatology reports\nreferenced with respect to Dr. Fletcher\u2019s opinion.111\nThe ALJ concluded her RFC for plaintiff a ccurately reflected plaintiff\u2019s ability to\nperform work-related activities based on support from \u201cthe objective evidence of cervical[DDD] and radiculopathy managed conservative ly, the potential impact of obesity, and\nmental health symptoms that have remained stable with ongoing outpatient\ntreatment.\u201d\n112\n  The court agrees and finds the ALJ\u2019s RF C is supported by substantial evidence. \n107 Id. (citing id., Exs. 20F/47, 20F/34, 20F/27).\n108 Id. at 21 (citing id., Ex. 17F7/4-8).  The ALJ also rejected other non-treating \nmedical opinions that suggested less restrictive  limitations than the RFC she found the\nrecord supported.  See id.  (finding the medical evidence of record supported more\nrestrictive and postural limitations than sugges ted by consultative examiner Izzy Pines,\nD.O.), id. (rejecting opinions of Joseph Michel, M. D. and Darrin Campo, M.D. finding \u201cno\nsevere physical impairments,\u201d and \u201ccapable of work at a medium level of exertion,\u201d\nrespectively).\n109 Id. (citing id., Ex. 15F/7).\n110 Id. (citing id., Exs. 16F, 18F).\n111 Id. (citing id., Ex. 17F/4-8).\n112 Id.\n20Also, because the ALJ found the opinions of Dr. Fletcher, PT Vari,  and Dr. Ram were\nnot persuasive, much less equally  persuasive as those of the consultative examiners,\nshe was not required to consider t he additional factors listed in 20 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520c(c)(3)-(5) as plaintiff suggests.  Plai ntiff accuses the ALJ of focusing on a\nlimited portion of the evidence when she found those opinions unpersuasive.113\nAlthough the ALJ\u2019s discussion of plaintiff\u2019s treat ment notes is not as extensive as that\nset forth in plaintiff\u2019s briefing, the Th ird Circuit has not required the ALJ to \u201cmake\nreference to every relevant treatment not e in a case where the claimant . . . has\nvoluminous medical records,\u201d so long as the re viewing court can discern the basis of the\ndecision.114  Here, the court finds the basis of the ALJ\u2019s determination with regard to the\nnotes of plaintiff\u2019s treating medi cal professionals is discernable.\nViewing the record as a whole, the court finds the ALJ applied the correct legal\nstandards and that her decision is reasonabl e and supported by substantial evidence.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nTherefore, plaintiff\u2019s motion for su mmary judgment (D.I. 11) is DENIED, and\ndefendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 15) is GRANTED.\n113 See, e.g., D.I. 12 at 9 (For Dr. Fletcher, the ALJ cited to a mostly normal\nexam.); id. at 10 (For PT Vari, the ALJ focused on a single, normal exam.); id. at 12 (For\nDr. Ram, the ALJ used a \u201chighly selective de scription of [another doctor\u2019s] examination\nresults.\u201d).\n114 See Fargnoli v.
