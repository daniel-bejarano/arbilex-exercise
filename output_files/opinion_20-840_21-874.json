No. 20-840-SRF\nGAS RECOVERY, LLC, et al.,\nDefendants.\nDANIEL DAVIS, III, )\nPlaintiff, 5\n\nVv. C.A. No. 21-874-SRF\nLOGAN SPICER, et al., 5\nDefendants. \u2018\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 3rd day of May, 2022, the court having considered Plaintiff Daniel\nDavis\u2019 (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) Second Motion for Sanctions and to Enforce Subpoena as to Nonparty\nShawn Sweigart (D.I. 66), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion for sanctions is\nDENIED-IN-PART, and Plaintiff is granted leave to re-notice the deposition for the following\nreasons:\n\n1. Background. Nonparty Shawn Sweigart (\u201cMr. Sweigart\u201d) was personally served\nwith a subpoena to testify and produce records in this matter on September 28, 2021, and a\ndeposition was noticed for October 18, 2021. (D.I. 66, Ex. 1) Mr. Sweigart did not appear for\nthe deposition or produce the documents requested, nor did he object to the subpoena by motion\n\nor otherwise. (D.I. 66 at 1, Ex. 2)\n2. On November 12, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Sanctions and to Enforce\nSubpoena as to Nonparty Shawn Sweigart, seeking to compel Mr. Sweigart\u2019s attendance at the\ncourt for purposes of taking deposition and production of documents or, alternatively, sanctions\nincluding a monetary fine of $200 per day of noncompliance and payment of attorneys\u2019 fees.\n(D.I. 49)\n\n3. On December 21, 2021, the court ordered Plaintiff to provide written notice and\nproof of service of the Motion for Sanctions and to Enforce Subpoena as to Nonparty Shawn\nSweigart (D.I. 49) prior to seeking relief from the court. The court subsequently denied without\nprejudice the motion on February 24, 2022, due to lack of proof of service of the motion on the\nnonparty.\n\n4. On March 10, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Second Motion for Sanctions and to Enforce\nSubpoena as to Nonparty Shawn Sweigart, seeking the same relief as the previous motion. (D.I.\n66) On March 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed written notice and proof of service of the motion on Mr.\nSweigart. (D.I 68)\n\n5. Legal Standard. \u201c[{T]he power of the Court to impose sanctions in discovery\nmatters is undisputed, and the exercise of that authority rests in the sound discretion of the\nCourt.\u201d Bartos v. Pa., 2010 WL 1816674, at *6 (M.D. Pa. May 5, 2010); see Wisniewski v.\nJohns\u2014Manville Corp., 812 F.2d 81, 90 (3d Cir.1987). \u201cRule 37(b)(1) provides the appropriate\nmeans to sanction a nonparty\u201d who fails to appear at deposition or fails \u201cto follow the court\u2019s\ndirections.\u201d General Ins. Co. of Am. V. Eastern Consol. Utilities, Inc., 126 F.3d 215, 220 n.3 (3d\nCir. 1997); see Miller v. Transamerican Press, Inc., 709 F.2d 524, 531 (9th Cir.1983) (noting\nthat Rule 37(b)(1) sanctions may be available against nonparty deponent who failed to appear at\n\na deposition in violation of a court order); Adesanya v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 2016 WL\n4401522, at *5 (D. N.J. August 15, 2016) (internal citations omitted) (\u201cSanctionable misconduct\nby a non-party witness can include failure to appear\u201d). Sanctions should \u201calways be narrowly\ntailored to meet the misconduct, and should entail no greater punishment than is reasonably\nnecessary to address the specific wrongdoing that confronts the court.\u201d Bartos, 2010 WL\n1816674, at *6; see also Klein v. Stahl, GMBH & Co., Maschinefabrik, 185 F.3d 98 (3d Cir.\n1999). \u201c[F]ees can only be assessed against non-party witnesses upon a finding of civil\ncontempt.\u201d Yarus v. Walgreen Co., 2015 WL 4041955, at *5 (E.D. Pa. July 1, 2015). \u201cRule\n45(g) permits the court issuing a subpoena to hold in contempt a person who, having been\nserved, fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena or an order related to it.\u201d Jd. at *3\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n\n6. Plaintiff's motion for sanctions as to Mr. Sweigart is DENIED without prejudice.\nThe Plaintiff has not satisfied the requirements for the court to grant sanctions against the\nnonparty on the present record. The Plaintiff has not made a showing that the court should find\nthe nonparty in civil contempt for his failure to appear for deposition on one occasion. Granting\nPlaintiff leave to re-notice the deposition properly addresses \u201cthe specific wrongdoing that\nconfronts the court,\u201d such that the imposition of sanctions at this stage would be disproportionate\nto the conduct alleged. Bartos, 2010 WL 1816674, at *6. Indeed, Plaintiff admits that he \u201cseeks\nsanctions that are no more than necessary to coerce Mr. Sweigart\u2019s compliance with the\nsubpoena.\u201d (D.I. 66 at 2) The court agrees and denies without prejudice Plaintiffs motion for\nsanctions should Mr. Sweigart fail to obey this Order of the court.\n\n7. Further, \u201c[mJonetary sanctions are not expressly made available against a\n\nnonparty\u201d absent a finding of civil contempt. Yarus, 2015 WL 4041955, at *3. A finding of\ncivil contempt against a nonparty is a high burden, and the following elements must be met: \u201c(1)\na valid court order existed, (2) the [individual] had knowledge of the order; and (3) the\n[individual] disobeyed the order.\u201d Harris v. City of Phila., 47 F.3d 1311, 1326 (3d Cir. 1995);\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(g) (\u201cThe court...may hold in contempt a person who, having been served,\nfails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena or an order related to it\u201d). The Plaintiff has\nnot met his burden to satisfy those elements on the present record. See Miller, 709 F.2d at 531\n(Rule 37(b) \u201cprovides sanctions only for failure to obey a court order\u201d); See General Ins. Co.,\n126 F.3d at 220 n.3 (Rule 37(b)(1) \u201cgrants a district court the authority to punish a nonparty for\nfailing to follow the court\u2019s directions\u201d). Thus, Mr. Sweigart\u2019s conduct is not so egregious as to\nwarrant sanctions at this stage. See Yarus, 2015 WL 4041955, at *5 (denying party\u2019s motion for\nmonetary sanctions against nonparty witnesses and instead instructing party to make one final\nattempt to depose witnesses).\n\n8. Although the Second Motion for Sanctions is denied, the court grants leave to the\nPlaintiff to serve another subpoena on Mr. Sweigart to appear for a deposition and produce\nrecords within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order. The court denies Plaintiffs request to\nnotice the deposition to take place in the courtroom of the undersigned judicial officer.\nDepositions are customarily taken in the offices of counsel for the party seeking to examine the\nwitness. The court sees no reason to grant an exception on the present record.\n\n9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED: Nonparty, Shawn Sweigart, is ordered to attend\na deposition \u201cat a time and place designated by Plaintiff within thirty (30) days of the date of this\n\nOrder.\u201d General Ins. Co., 126 F.3d at 217.\n10. \u2018Plaintiff shall serve a copy of this Memorandum Order upon the nonparty witness\nwith service of the subpoena for his deposition and shall provide the court with proof of service\n\nof the same.\n\nDated: May 3, 2022\n\nUnited States\n\nagistrate Judge\n"}
