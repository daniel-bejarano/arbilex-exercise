{"case_name": "VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel Corporation", "case_number": "18-966", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "06-27-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nVLSI TECHNOLOGY LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nINTEL CORPORATION, \nDefendant C.A. No. 18-966-CFC-CJB \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nDefendant Intel has filed a motion to exclude certain testimony of Plaintiff \nVLSI's technical expert, Dr. Thomas M. Conte. D.I. 787. \nI. \nResolution of the motion is governed by Federal Rules of Evidence 402, \n403, and 702. Rule 402 provides that \n[ r ]elevant evidence is admissible unless ... provide[ d] \notherwise [by] the United States Constitution; a federal \nstatute; these rules; or other rules prescribed by the \nSupreme Court. Irrelevant evidence is not admissible. \nFed. R. Evid. 402. \nUnder Rule 403, \n[t]he court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative \nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or \nmore of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or \nneedlessly presenting cumulative evidence. \nFed. R. Evid. 403. \nRule 702 provides: \nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, \nskill, experience, training, or education may testify in the \nform of an opinion or otherwise if: \nFed. R. Evid. 702. (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other \nspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to \nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in \nissue; \n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; \n( c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles \nand methods; and \n( d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and \nmethods to the facts of the case. \nII. \nIntel asks first that I exclude Conte's testimony \"about Intel's purported \nlitigation misconduct, corporate culture, and ethics.\" D.I. 788 at 1. Intel argues \nthat Conte's opinions on these matters \"are baseless, irrelevant, beyond his \ntechnical expertise, highly prejudicial to Intel, and likely to mislead the jury.\" D.I. \n788 at 1. I lack sufficient information to judge whether Conte' s opinions on these \nmatters are baseless, but I agree with Intel that any opinions Conte might offer on \nsuch matters are irrelevant, beyond his expertise, highly prejudicial to Intel, and \n2 likely to mislead a jury; and they are therefore inadmissible under Rules 403 and \n702. \nThe jury will be asked to decide in the first phase of the trial whether Intel \ninfringed the asserted patents and whether the asserted patents are invalid. If the \njury decides that at least one of the asserted patents was infringed and is not \ninvalid, it will be tasked with deciding whether VLSI is entitled to damages. \nIntel's purported litigation misconduct, corporate culture, and ethics have no \nrelevance to any of the infringement, invalidity, or damages issues that will be \npresented to the jury. And any conceivable probative value Intel's purported \nlitigation misconduct, corporate culture, and ethics could have would be \nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice against Intel, confusing \nthe issues, misleading the jury, and wasting time. In addition, Conte is an engineer \nwith no qualifications that would enable him to offer reliable opinions about \nlitigation misconduct and ethics. Accordingly, I will exercise my discretion and \npreclude him under Rules 402,403, and 702 from offering opinions at trial about \nIntel's purported litigation misconduct, corporate culture, and ethics. \nVLSI says Conte' s testimony on these issues is appropriate because his \nexpert analysis was limited by \"the onerous conditions Intel placed on his code \nreview, and Intel's delayed productions and non-production of pertinent materials.\" \nD.I. 865 at 1. VLSI seems to be alleging here that Intel violated its discovery \n3 obligations under the Court's orders and/or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nBut if VLSI thought that Intel failed to comply with its discovery obligations and \nthat that failure prejudiced Conte's analysis, VLSI should have sought relief from \nthe Court. It is not the province of the jury to hear and decide discovery disputes. \nVLSI insists that it needs to offer Conte' s opinions about \"Intel's repeated \nviolations of Intel's 'Corporate Conduct/Ethics,\"' because Intel intends to \"argue \nits corporate ethics provide a defense to patent infringement.\" D.I. 865 at 2-3 \n( citation omitted). But Intel has promised that it \"will demonstrate \nnoninfringement on the merits.\" D.I. 900 at 1-2. If Intel does not abide by that \nrepresentation and offers at trial self-serving testimony to the effect that it does not \ninfringe patents because of its ethics policies, it may open the door to allow VLSI \nto introduce evidence that Intel does not comply with those policies. But even if \nIntel opened that door, I do not see how Conte could be the source of such \ncounterevidence, as he is not offered as a fact witness with percipient knowledge \nof Intel's alleged misconduct, and VLSI has not suggested that he is an expert on \ncorporate ethics. \nAccordingly, Conte may not testify at trial about Intel's purported litigation \nmisconduct, corporate culture, and ethics. \n4 III. \nIntel next asks that I bar Conte from testifying at trial that Intel derives more \n\"benefit\" from infringing the dependent claims of an asserted patent (the #027 \npatent) than it does from infringing the independent claims from which the \ndependent claims depend. D.I. 788 at 1, 5. Independent claims 1, 8, and 18 of the \n#027 patent require adjusting voltage levels of an integrated circuit based on an \n\"analog variation parameter.\" D.I. 789-1, Ex. 2 at claims 1, 8, 18. Dependent \nclaims 3, 5, and 10 (which depend from claims 1 or 8) \"further\" require adjusting \nvoltage levels based on a \"digital variation parameter.\" D.I. 789-1, Ex. 2 at claims \n3, 5, 10. Thus, although the independent claims cover devices that use an \"analog \nvariation parameter\" both with and without a \"digital variation parameter,\" the \ndependent claims cover only devices that use both analog and digital variation \nparameters. \nIn his expert report, Conte says that he \"expect[s] each of the Accused \nProducts [that uses only the analog variation parameter] to obtain at least a 1.18% \npower savings benefit from Intel's infringement of claims 1, 8, and 18,\" and he \n\"expect[s] each of the Accused Products [that uses both the analog and digital \nvariation parameters] to obtain at least a 2.63% power savings benefit from Intel's \ninfringement of claims 3, 5, and 10.\" D.I. 789-1, Ex. 1 ,r,r 828-29. Conte further \nopines that \"[t]he[] benefits\" obtained from infringing the dependent claims \"are \n5 additive to the benefits the Accused Products obtain from infringing [ the \nindependent] claims\" and that \"[t]hese benefits are fully apportioned to be \ncoextensive with the claims.\" D.I. 789-1, Ex. 1 ,I,I 829-30. Relying on these \nopinions, VLSI's damages expert, Dr. Ryan Sullivan, opines that Intel owes $1.6 \nbillion for infringing the independent claims and an additional $2.3 billion for \ninfringing the dependent claims. D.I. 789-1, Ex. 3 ,i,r 315-16. \nIntel argues that I need to preclude Conte from offering these opinions about \nthe relative benefits of Intel's infringement of the independent and dependent \nclaims because \n[i]t would be legal error to allow VLSI to argue at trial that \nthe narrowing elements recited in a dependent claim\u00ad\neach of which further /imi,ts the scope of the dependent \nclaim-somehow create additional value beyond the \nunderlying independent claim, which by definition, \nencompasses everything in the dependent claim and more. \nD.I. 788 at 6 ( emphases in original). Intel does not identify a Rule of Evidence that \nbars the admission of Conte's opinions, but I take it as a given that an expert's \nopinions that are incorrect as a matter of law are inadmissible as irrelevant under \nRules 402 and 403 and unreliable under Rule 702. And I agree with Intel that \nConte's opinions about the relative benefits he \"expects\" Intel \"to obtain\" from \ninfringement of the independent and dependent claims of the #027 patent are \nwrong as a matter of law; and, therefore, I will bar him under Rules 402, 403, and \n702 from offering those opinions at trial. \n6 As an initial matter, Conte errs in saying that Intel \"obtains\" \"benefits\" from \ninfringement. Patents convey two benefits. The first, granted to the patentee, is \nthe right to exclude others for a limited period from practicing the invention recited \nin the patent's claims. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(a){l) (\"Every patent shall contain ... a \ngrant to the patentee ... of the right to exclude others from making, using, offering \nfor sale, or selling the invention .... \"); see Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, \n255 (1891). The second benefit, the disclosure of the claimed invention in the \npatent's specification, is enjoyed by the public at large and is the price the patentee \npays to garner its right to exclude. See Scott Paper Co. v. Marca/us Mfg. Co., 326 \nU.S. 249, 255 (1945) (\"By the patent laws Congress has given to the inventor \nopportunity to secure the material rewards for his invention for a limited time, on \ncondition that he make full disclosure for the benefit of the public of the manner of \nmaking and using the invention, and that upon the expiration of the patent the \npublic be left free to use the invention.\"); id. (noting that an \"aim of the patent laws \nis not only that members of the public shall be free to manufacture the product or \nemploy the process disclosed by the expired patent, but also that the consuming \npublic at large shall receive the benefits of the unrestricted exploitation, by others, \nof its disclosures\"). \"Infringement\" is the legal determination that a party \ninterfered with the patentee's exclusionary right by practicing the claimed \ninvention \"without authority.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271. The infringing party may well \n7 have benefitted from practicing the invention, but it does not \"obtain benefits\" \nfrom a finding that it infringed the patent. \nConte compounds his first error by saying that a dependent claim provides \n\"a benefit\" that is \"additive\" to the benefits offered by the independent claim from \nwhich it depends. VLSI, too, insists in its briefing that a dependent claim \"covers \nmore inventive benefit\" than its corresponding independent claim. D.I. 865 at 5 \n( emphasis omitted). But the law says the opposite. Under \u00a7 112( d) of the Patent \nAct, \"a claim in dependent form shall contain a reference to a claim previously set \nforth and then specify afurther limitation of the subject matter claimed. A claim \nin dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations \nof the claim to which it refers.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(d) (emphasis added). Thus, the \nlimitations that a dependent claim \"adds\" to an independent claim are precisely \nthat-limitations that limit the coverage of the dependent claim to a scope that is \nnarrower than the scope of the independent claim. It is the independent claim that \nis broader and \"covers more inventive benefit\" for the patentee. 1 Thus, with \nrespect to infringement, any \"benefit\" of a dependent claim is already covered by \nthe independent claim from which it depends. \n1 To the extent a dependent claim reveals something not expressly recited in the \nindependent claim, it might be said (albeit awkwardly) that the public \"obtains\" an \n\"additive\" benefit from the dependent claim. But that is of no moment in a patent \ninfringement case. \n8 Conte' s error in opining about the relative \"benefits\" Intel \"obtains\" from \ninfringing the #027 patent's dependent and independent claims is further \ncompounded because his opinions are being offered to support VLSI's damages \nclaims. The relevant question for damages in a patent infringement case is not \nwhat the defendant gained by practicing the patent, but rather what the plaintiff lost \nbecause of the defendant's infringement. When a patentee is deprived of its right \nto exclude others from practicing the patent, it is entitled to \"damages adequate to \ncompensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for \nthe use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as \nfixed by the court.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 (emphasis added.) The purpose of \ncompensatory damages is to make the injured party whole. Thus, as the Federal \nCircuit held in Mentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA, Inc., 851 F.3d 1275 (Fed. Cir. \n2017): \"[t]he question to be asked in determining damages is how much had the \nPatent Holder ... suffered by the infringement. And that question (is) primarily: \nhad the Infringer not infringed, what would [the] Patent Holder[] have made?\" Id. \nat 1284 (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). \nSince infringement of a dependent claim necessarily constitutes \ninfringement of the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends, \nthe patentee's losses caused by the infringement of the dependent claim cannot be \n9 higher than the losses caused by infringement of its corresponding independent \nclaim. A rational licensee would not pay-and thus a patentee could not obtain\u00ad\nin a hypothetical negotiation under Georgia-Pacific a higher royalty for the right to \npractice a valid dependent claim than the licensee would pay to practice the \nbroader corresponding independent claim. If anything, the royalty would be higher \nfor the broader independent claim. A car with a radio may be more valuable than a \ncar without a radio, but the right to sell cars with and without radios is more \nvaluable than the right to sell only cars with radios. \nIt may be, as VLSI maintains, that Intel makes more money selling products \nthat have both analog and digital parameters because products with both \nparameters are sold at higher prices than products with only analog parameters. \nSee D.I. 865 at 5-6. But since both the independent and the dependent claims \ncover products with digital parameters, VLSI does not gain any \"additive benefit\" \nfrom Intel's infringement of the dependent claims. Cf Wahpeton Canvas Co. v. \nFrontier, Inc., 870 F.2d 1546, 1552 n.10 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"Infringement of an \nindependent claim would result in the same damage award as would infringement \nof all claims dependent thereon and non-infringement of an independent claim \ncarries with it non-infringement of all claims dependent thereon.\"). \nFor these reasons, I will grant Intel's request to bar Conte from testifying at \ntrial that Intel derives more benefit from practicing the dependent claims of the \n10 #027 patent than it does from practicing the patent's independent claims. D.I. 788 \nat 1, 5. \nIV. \nLastly, Intel asks me to preclude Conte from offering at trial opinions about \nthe Accused Products' power savings that are based on his simulation of a single \nIntel Product. D.I. 788 at 8. Intel faults Conte for \"treat[ing] that simulation as \nrepresentative of hundreds of other accused products-across different families, \ntypes, configurations, and generations.\" D.I. 788 at 8 ( emphases omitted). And it \nsays that Conte \"did not even attempt to account for the countless differences \nacross these many products, and instead merely offered his speculative \n'expect[ation]' that the differences do not matter.\" D.I. 788 at 8 (alteration in \noriginal) ( citing D.I. 789-1, Ex. 1 ,r,r 3 75, 828-29). These objections, however, go \nto the weight, not the admissibility, of Conte's opinions. Intel is free to raise these \nissues when it cross examines Conte at trial. Accordingly, I will deny Intel's \nmotion in this regard. \n* * * * \n11 NOW THEREFORE , at Wilmington on this Twenty-seventh day of June in \n2022, Defendant Intel Corporation's Motion to Exclude Evidence from Dr. \nThomas M. Conte (D.I. 787) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART: \n1. Dr. Conte is barred from offering opinions at trial about Intel's purported \nlitigation misconduct, corporate culture, and ethics; \n2. Dr. Conte is barred from testifying at trial that Intel derives more benefit \nfrom practicing the dependent claims of the #027 patent than it does from \npracticing the patent's independent claims; and \n3. Intel's motion is DENIED in all other respects. \n12 UNITED STATES CHIEF \nDISTRICT JUDGE "}
