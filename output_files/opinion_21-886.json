Civil Action No. 21-886-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn 2015, Petitioner Edwin Andrews (\"Petitioner'') pleaded guilty to two counts of \nsecond-degree robbery and one count of possession of a deadly weapon during the \ncommission of a felony. (D.1. 1-1 at 4) The Delaware Superior Court sentenced him to \n15 years of Level V incarceration, suspended after 12 years for descending levels of \nsupervision. See Andrews v. State, No. 289,2020, Order at 1-2 (Del. June 11, 2021). \nOn July 27, 2020, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a motion for \nmodification of sentence under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 35(b}. See id. \nThe Delaware Superior Court denied the motion. Petitioner appealed that judgment, \narguing that \"his numerous medical issues leave him unusually susceptible to the \ndangers posed by COVID-19.\" Id. He also argued that the increased health risk posed \nby COVID-19 implicates the Eighth Amendment. Id. The Delaware Supreme Court \nrejected Petitioner's argument and affirmed the Superior Court's denial of his Rule 35 \nmotion. Id.; (D.I. 1-1 at 5) Thereafter, Petitioner filed in this Court a form petition for habeas relief under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254 challenging the Delaware state courts' denial of his Rule 35 motion. (D.I \n1) He contends that the Delaware state court ignored his medical issues and that their \ndenial of his Rule 35 motion violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal \nprotection. (D.I. 1 at 5-15) \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA district court judge may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly \nappears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is \nnot entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll.\u00a7 2254. A petitioner is not entitled to \nfederal habeas relief unless he has exhausted state remedies for his habeas claims by \n\"fairly presenting\" the substance of the claims to the state's highest court, either on \ndirect appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, and in a procedural manner permitting \nthe state courts to consider them on the merits. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A); Duncan \nv. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 365 (1995); Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. \n1997). Petitioners seeking habeas corpus relief in federal court have the burden to \nestablish exhaustion of state court remedies, 1 even when they are seeking habeas relief \nbased on the risks posed by COVID-19. See, e.g., Valdez v. Kauffman, 2021 WL \n1425300, at *2-3 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 15, 2021); Ginn v. Kauffman, 2021 WL 1340140, at *2-\n3 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 9, 2021); Davis v. Kauffman, 2021 WL 1225930, at *3-4 (M.D. Pa. Apr. \n1, 2013). \n1 See DeFoy v. McCullough, 393 F.3d 439, 442 (3d Cir. 2005). \n2 Ill. DISCUSSION \nThere are two threshold issues in this case: (1) is a state prisoner's claim that the \nEighth Amendment requires his release during the COVID-19 pandemic cognizable \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; and (2) did Petitioner exhaust state remedies for the instant \nclaim. With respect to the first question, the Third Circuit has held that immigration \ndetainees may proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to challenge allegedly unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Hope v. Warden York \nCty. Prison, 972 F.3d 310 (3d Cir. 2020). Importantly, however, the Hope Court \ncautioned that it was \"not creating a garden variety cause of action,\" and the Third \nCircuit has not extended its holding in Hope to cases outside the immigration context \ninvolving petitioners in custody pursuant to a state court judgment of conviction. Hope, \n972 F.3d at 324-25; see, e.g., Houck v. Moser, 2021 WL 1840827, *1 (W.D. Pa. May 7, \n2021) (\"Even in the COVID-19 era, a writ of habeas corpus is not a generally available \nremedy outside the immigrant detainee context contemplated in Hope v. Warden York \nCounty Prison[ ... ].\"). Given the significant amount of uncertainty surrounding the issue, \nthe Court will refrain from deciding whether Petitioner can challenge the Delaware \ncourts' failure to release him despite the risks posed by COVID-19. \nInstead, the Court concludes that the instant Petition is subject to summary \ndismissal because Petitioner failed to exhaust state remedies. In Delaware, a prisoner \nmay file a motion for reduction or modification of sentence pursuant to Superior Court \nCriminal Rule 35(b) and/or apply to the Delaware Department of Correction for a \nmedical modification of sentence under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217. Under\u00a7 4217, the \n3 Department of Correction may seek modification of an inmate's sentence for good \ncause, including \"a serious medical illness or infirmity.\" See Eggleston v. State, 203 \nA.3d 738 {Table), 2019 WL 343669 {Del. Jan. 24, 2019) {citing 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217{c)). \nParticularly relevant to this case, the Delaware Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 4217 is \nthe statutory vehicle for seeking sentence modification in light of an offender's \nunderlying medical conditions and potential exposure to COVID-19. See Johnson v. \nState, 239 A.3d 388 {Table), 2020 WL 5626231, at *2 {Del. Sept. 18, 2020); see also \nChrichlow v. State, 257 A.3d 449 {Table), 2021 WL 3087677, at *2 {Del. July 21, 2021) \n{\"An application under\u00a7 4217 is the proper vehicle for Chrichlow's claims that his \ncancer treatment and potential exposure to COVID-19 warrants reduction of his \nsentence.\"); Hernandez-Vargas v. State, 240 A.3d 2 {Table), 2020 WL 5951372, at *2 \n(Del. Oct. 7, 2020) (\"[Tihe decision of whether the early release of low-risk offenders \nwould lessen the dangers posed by COVID-19 to the general prison population is best \nleft to the discretion of the Department of Corrections, which may move for the \nmodification of any prisoner's sentence for good cause under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4217.\"). \nAlthough Petitioner filed a Rule 35{b) motion to modify his sentence and \nappealed the denial of that motion, the face of the instant Petition does not indicate that \nPetitioner pursued the discretionary process for determining his eligibility for a medical \nmodification or sentence under\u00a7 4217 by submitting a request and the required form to \nthe Department of Correction. Accordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant \nPetition without prejudice for failure to exhaust available state remedies. \n4 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant \nPetition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because \nPetitioner has failed to make a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional \nright.\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) ; 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, \n113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order will be entered. \nDated: March 7, 2022 \nChief Judge \n5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nEDWIN ANDREWS , \nPetitioner, \nV. \nKOLAWOLE AKINBAYO, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE, \nRespondents. Civil Action No. 21-886-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington, this Seventh day of March in 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Petitioner Edwin Andrews ' Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief Under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.I. 1) is SUMMARILY DISMISSED without prejudice for failure to \nexhaust state remedies . \n2. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because \nPetitioner has failed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2 ). \nColm F. Connlly \nChief Judge "}
