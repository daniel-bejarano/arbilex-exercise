{"case_name": "Sprint Communications Company L.P. v. WideOpenWest, Inc., et al", "case_number": "18-361", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "01-19-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nSPRINT COMMUNICATIONS COMP ANY \nL.P., \nPlaintiff \nV. \nWIDEOPENWEST , INC., et al., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 18-361-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nThe issue before me is \"Sprint's assertion that WOW is withholding privileged \ndocuments that are allegedly inconsistent with WO W's belief that it would not be sued by \nSprint.\" (D.I. 454 at 1). I held a pretrial conference for this case on October 25, 2022. While \narguing for its second motion in limine (D.I. 433), Plaintiff Sprint raised the issue of certain \nprivileged communications . (10/25/2022 Hr. Tr. at 32:17-25). Plaintiffs second motion in limine \nsought to exclude testimony about company \"folklore\" regarding a right to practice Sprint's \npatents. Defendants plan to assert the affirmative defense of implied license, supported by this \n\"folklore\" testimony from WOW's Rule 30(b)(6) designee, Mr. Mitchell, and general counsel, \nMr. Martin. I determined that the folklore testimony would be admissible for the limited purpose \nof showing WO W's subjective belief, which I believed was a component of the implied license \ndefense. (10/25/2022 Hr. Tr. at 25:18-26:2) . However , Sprint is concerned that WOW is using \nprivilege to withhold documents relevant to Mr. Martin's and Mr. Mitchell's beliefs that might \nundercut WOW's position. Sprint argues that this is \"a classic sword and shield problem. \" (D.I. \n454 at 2-3). \n1 In their letters and at the pretrial conference, the parties identified the following privilege \nlog entries as being at issue: 6-8, 16, 20, 33, 35, and 41-45.1 (D.I. 453). Defendants did not \nsubmit entry 45. I have reviewed the other identified documents. Some of them are not relevant \nto the present dispute. Some, however, do speak to Mr. Martin's beliefs regarding the possibility \nof suit by Sprint. Therefore, I will exclude testimony by Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Martin regarding \ncompany beliefs and \"folklore\" unless Defendants within one week disclose privilege log entries \n8, 20, 33, 35, and 41-44. \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nff1 \nEntered this ~ay of January, 2023 \n1 Plaintiff also indicates in a footnote that it is \"concerned\" about some additional documents \nclaimed to be privileged. (D.I. 454 n. 1). I do not consider \"concerns\" (and especially not \n\"concerns\" described in a footnote) to raise any issue that I need to resolve. Therefore, I did not \nreview these additional documents. \n2 "}
