February  27, 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware  NOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE  \nPending before the Court is Petitioner Benjamin Crump\u2019s (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) authorized second \nPetition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d).  (D.I. 2).  The \nState filed an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply.  (D.I. 10; D.I. 17).  For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny  the Petition as second or successive.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Facts1 \nOn November 23, 1981, the thirteen -year-old victim was leaving the Clifton Park \nCommunity Center (\u201cCommunity Center\u201d) with her friend on her way to her home in the Clifton Park Apartment complex, when a man emerged from the bushes and bumped into the victim.  After \nexcusing himself, the man bumped into the victim again, and grabbed her. The victim\u2019s friend screamed and fled the scene.  The assailant dr agged the victim, kicking and screaming, into a \nvacant apartment in the complex, where he raped her.  After the assailant fled the scene of the rape, \nthe victim returned to the Community Center and recounted the incident to an employee of the Center.  The victim was treated at a hospital, and later gave a tape- recorded statement to the police, \nwhich included a description of her assailant.  At that time, the victim could not identify a picture of her assailant in any of the photo books.  After awakening lat er that night from a nightmare, the \nvictim drew a sketch of her attacker, but she could not identify him in any of the photo books with which she was subsequently presented.  In January of 1983, the victim was shown a photo spread comprising of approximately forty photographs, including one of Petitioner .  Petitioner  had been \nidentified as a suspect in several other rapes that  had occurred in the vicinity of the attack in this \ncase.  The victim indicated that Petitioner  looked like her assailant, except tha t the assailant\u2019s eyes \n \n1  The facts are from the Honorable Joseph J. Farnan\u2019s Memorandum Opinion denying \nPetitioner\u2019s first habeas petition in 1991.  ( See D.I. 4 -1 at 14-19). 2 were darker.  At trial, the victim again identified Petitioner  as the man who had raped her.  During \nthe prosecution\u2019s redirect examination of the victim, the prosecutor sought to introduce portions \nof the transcript prepared from the tape- recorded statement that the victim had given to the police \nfollowing the rape.  Petitioner  objected based on the Best Evidence Rule.  The prosecutor testified \nthat the tape had since been erased and used again during the three -year interim for other  purposes, \npursuant to standard police department procedure. The c ourt permitted the transcript to be \nintroduced into evidence, concluding that it was permissible under the Best Evidence Rule.  During cross -examination of the victim at trial, she admitted that although she had no clear independent \nrecollection of the tape- recorded statement, she had reviewed the transcript of the statement and \nhad corrected several answers which were \u201cincorrect.\u201d  The victim indicated that the answers were \nincorrect because they did not match her present recollection of the rape.  This \u201ccorrected\u201d version \nof the transcript was also admitted into evidence.  In addition to the victim\u2019s identification of \nPetitioner  as her attacker, the State offered hair analyses at trial which  showed that Petitioner \u2019s \nhair had the same twenty characteristics as the victim\u2019s assailant.  In rebuttal, Petitioner  claimed \nthat he had never seen the victim, and that he had never been to the Community Center.  Petitioner  \nalso testified that at the time of the attack, he had been moving furniture between his old apartment and his girlfriend\u2019s apartment, who lived in t he same apartment complex as the victim. The jury \nrejected Petitioner \u2019s alibi defense and found him guilty of kidnapping and forcible rape. \nB. Procedural History  \nOn June 19, 1984, a Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of first -degree kidnapping \nand first -degree rape.  (D.I. 11 -1 at Entry Nos. 12, 14) .  The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner \nto two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.  (D.I. 11- 1 at Entry No. 15) .  Petitioner appealed, \nand the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed his convictions on September 6, 1985.  See Crump v. State , 505 A.2d 452 (Table), 1985 WL 188342 (Del. Sept. 6, 1985).   3 Petitioner filed his first motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior \nCourt Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 mot ion\u201d) on March 31, 1988.  (D.I. 11 -1 at Entry No. 31) .  The \nSuperior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion on October 18, 1998.  See State v. Crump, \n1988 WL 109381, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 18, 1988).  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on August 21, 1989.  See Crump v. State , 567 A.2d 420 (Table), 1989 WL 114290, \nat *1 (Del. Aug. 21, 1989).  On November 30, 1989, Petitioner filed a federal habeas petition in \nthis Court, which the Honorable Joseph J. Farnan denied on July 2, 1991.  (D.I. 4 -1 at 13- 24).   \nIn 1996, the Innoc ence Project ( \u201cthe Project\u201d) began assisting Petitioner.   See State v. \nCrump , 2017 WL 6403510, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 14, 2017).  On February 28, 2000, the \nProject filed a motion in the Superior Court to release evidence from Petitioner\u2019s  trial for te sting, \nwhich the court granted on March 8, 2000.  (D.I. 11 -1 at Entry Nos. 51, 52) .  Forensic Science \nAssociates, on behalf of the Project , reviewed the FBI Special Agent\u2019s report and testimony \nregarding his hair comparison analysis and conducted DNA testi ng on a comb with pubic \ncombings from the victim .  D.I. 11 -18 at 51- 54, 98- 99; see Crump , 2017 WL 6403510, at *1.  In \nApril 2003, the scientists submitted a report identifying several issues of concern with the FBI Agent\u2019s report and testimony on the hair analysis, at one point stating, \u201cAt best [the Agent\u2019s] testimony . . . is a gross distortion of the scientific capacity of microscopic hair examinations to \ndistinguish between the hairs of individuals.\u201d  (D.I. 11- 18 at 51- 54).  The 2003 report also \nconcluded that Petitioner \u2019s claims of factual innocence were unsupported because Petitioner was \nthe contributor of the spermatozoa\u2019s DNA on the comb.  D.I. 11- 18 at 98- 99; see Crump , 2017 \nWL 6403510, at *1, 3.    \nIn a letter dated September  12, 2014, the United States Department of Justice (\u201cUSDOJ\u201d) \nadvised Petitioner that the FBI Special Agent\u2019s trial testimony regarding hair analysis was 4 problematic  and provided a copy of  the Independent Scientific Review performed for his case.  \n(D.I. 11 -18 at 118-21).   In a letter dated September 30, 2014, the USDOJ sent a letter to the \nDelaware Department of Justice stating that it had determined that the FBI Agent\u2019s testimony \n\u201cregardin g microscopic hair comparison analysis contain[ed] erroneous statements\u201d and  \n\u201cexceeded the limits of science and were therefore, invalid.\u201d  (D.I. 11 -18 at 132-33).  On May 15, \n2015, the USDOJ sent another letter to Petitioner, enclosing a copy of the September 30, 2014 letter it had sent to the Delaware Department of Justice.  (D.I. 11 -18 at 135). \nOn June 12, 2015, Petitioner,  acting pro se , filed a second Rule 61 motion in which he \nraised claims of the FBI Special Agent\u2019s improper testimony and ineffectiv e assistance of trial \ncounsel in failing to challenge that expert\u2019s testimony.  (D.I. 11- 1 at Entry No. 57).  The Superior \nCourt appointed postconviction counsel to assist Petitioner .  (Id. at Entry No. 59) .  On \nJanuary  3, 2017, postconviction counsel filed a motion to withdraw his representation of \nPetitioner , stating that, after thoroughly reviewing the record, he could not find any claims that he \ncould ethically advocate for Petitioner .  (D.I. 11-16).  On December 14, 2017, following responses \nfrom the State and Petitioner , the Superior Court denied Petitioner \u2019s second Rule 61 motion as \nuntimely  under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(i)(1)  and procedurally barred as \nrepetitive  under Rule 61(d), and granted postconviction counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.  See Crump, \n2017 WL 6403510, at *3.  On August 7, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment.  See Crump v. State , 194 A.3d 16 (Table), 2018 WL 3769261, at *1 (Del. Aug. \n7, 2018).  Petitione r subsequently petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of \ncertiorari, which was denied on March 25, 2019.  See Crump v. Delaware , 139 S. Ct. 1400 (2019).  \nII. PETITIONER\u2019S SECOND AND SUCCESSIVE PETITION   \nOn September 3, 2019, Petitioner  filed in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals an application \nfor leave to file the instant second federal habeas P etition and a memorandum in support of the 5 petition.  ( D.I. 2; D.I.  4).  On September 19, 2019, the Third Circuit granted Petitioner leave to file \nthe Petition, and transferred the Petition to be filed in this Court.  (D.I. 1 at 1) .  The Third Circuit\u2019s \norder explains that its decision to authorize Petitioner\u2019s filing of a second or successive petition \n\u201crepresents only a prima facie determination that Petitioner\u2019s proposed \u00a7 2254 petition is not an \nabuse of the writ.\u201d  ( Id.).  The Third Circuit\u2019s order is not dispositive or indicative of the merits of \nthe instant Petition.  Rather, the Third Circuit expressly states that, \u201c[i]f the District Court \ndetermines that the petition is abusive of the writ and that Petitioner cannot alternatively satisfy \nthe standards of  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B), the District Court must dismiss Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 \npetition.\u201d  (D.I. 1 at 1).    \nThe State contends that the Petition should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction  for failing \nto satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), without addressing the abuse of the writ doctrine.  \nThe State also asserts that the Petition  is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d) and procedurally barred.  \nFollowing the Third Circuit\u2019s express guidance, however, the Court will focus on whether the  \nClaims  are an abuse of the writ and, if not, whether Petitioner can satisfy the requirements of  \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B). \nIII. ABUSE OF THE WRIT DOCTRINE  \nPrior to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) , the \n\u201cdoctrine of abuse of the writ define[d] the circumstances in which federal courts decline to entertain a claim presented for the first time in a second or successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d  Goldblum v. Klem , 510 F.3d 204, 216 (3d Cir. 2007);  see also In re Minarik , 166 F.3d \n591, 595 (3d Cir. 1999).  Under this doctrine, \u201ca petitioner could prosecute another such petition only if he could (1) show cause for, and prejudice from, the omission of his new claim or claims from his earlier p etition ( i.e., that his proceeding would not constitute an \u2018abuse of the writ\u2019), or \n(2) demonstrate \u2018actual innocence.\u201d  Id . at 215.  6 Cause requires a showing of some external impediment preventing \ncounsel from constructing or raising the claim. The questi on is \nwhether petitioner possessed, or by reasonable means could have obtained, a sufficient basis to allege a claim in the first petition and pursue the matter through the habeas process.  Accordingly, if what \npetitioner knows or could discover upon reasonable investigation \nsupports a claim for relief in a federal habeas petition, what he does \nnot know is irrelevant.  Omission of the claim will not be excused \nmerely because evidence discovered later might also have supported or strengthened the claim.  Once the petitioner has established cause, he must show actual \nprejudice resulting from the errors of which he complains.  Actual \nprejudice means not merely that the errors at trial created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of \nconstitutional dimensions.   Even if a petitioner cannot show cause and prejudice, the failure to raise the claim in an earlier petition may nonetheless be excused if he or she can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.  A court, however, should \nexercise this authority only in a narrow class of cases, i.e ., in \nextraordinary instances when a constitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of one innocent of the crime.  To establish the requisite probability, the pet itioner must show that it is more likely \nthan not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in light of the new evidence.  \n \nGoldblum , 510 F.3d at 215\u201316 (cleaned up).  \nAEDPA\u2019s  \u201csubstantive standards governing the allowance of second or successive \napplications [\u00a7 2244(b)]  are more rigorous than the pre -AEDPA standard.\u201d  Minarik , 166 F.3d at \n595.  The Third Circuit has held that, in cases where the petitioner\u2019s first petition was filed before \nthe enactment of AEDPA, courts must engage in a case specifi c inquiry to determine whether the \napplication of AEDPA\u2019s new gatekeeping mechanism \u2013 \u00a7 2244(b)  \u2013 would have an impermissible \nretroactive effect .  See Minarik, 166 F.3d at 600.  In other words, if the petitioner \u201ccan show that \nhe would have been entitled to pursue his second petition under pre -AEDPA law, then the [ . . .] 7 default rule prohibits applying AEDPA\u2019s new substantive gatekeeping provisions to bar his claims.  \nIn the absence of such a showing, [. . .] the AEDPA standard must be applied.\u201d2  Id. at 602.   \nIV. AEDPA\u2019S SECOND OR SUCCESSIVE REQUIREMENTS  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4), \u201c[a] district court shall dismiss any claim presented in \na second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the appli cant satisfies the requirements of this section. \u201d  The requirements relevant to this case are:  \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been \ndiscovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and   (ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.  \n \n2  The Third Circuit articulated this two -step procedure as follows: \n \nwe must be mindful that [the petitioner\u2019s] initial \u00a7 2254 habeas \npetition was filed in 1995, before AEDPA was enacted. Because application of \u00a7 2244(b) would have a retroactive effect upon [the petitioner] if it foreclosed habeas review that would have been available under the pre -AEDPA abuse of the writ doctrine, we must \napply pre -AEDPA law and determine whether [the petitioner\u2019s] \nclaim was raised in an earlier habeas petition.  If so, the claim would have been barred and we may apply \u00a7 2244(b) \u2019s gatekeeping \nprovisions to [the petitioner\u2019s] most recent filings. If [the petitioner\u2019s] claim is new, however, we must determine whether [the petitioner] has demonstrated cause and prejudice for failing to present it in the state court. In the absence of such a showing, however, the AEDPA standard must be applied.   \nDiventura v. Wynder , 325 F. App\u2019 x 71, 74 (3d Cir. 2009).  The Third Circuit further stated, \n\u201cthe cause and prejudice standard also may be satisfied if the petitioner can demonstrate \nthat a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.\u201d  \nMcCleskey v. Zant , 499 U.S. 465, 495 (1991) . This requires a showing tha t a \u201cconstitutional \nviolation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d Schlup v. Delo , 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995).  8 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B).   Section 2244(B)(2)(b)(ii)\u2019s \u201cevidence as a whole\u201d provision means \n\u201call the evidence, old and new, incriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would \nnecessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that would  govern at trial.\u201d  House v. Bell , \n547 U.S. 518, 538 (2006) ; see also Munchinski v. Wilson, 694 F.3d 308, 336-37 (3d Cir. 2012).   \nThe Supreme Court has explained the difference between the \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d \nexception in the abuse of the writ doctri ne and \u00a7  2244(b)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s \u201cclear and convincing\u201d \nevidence standard as follows:  \nCongress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice \nexception into \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).  Rather, Congress \nconstrained the application of the exception.  Prior to AEDPA\u2019 s \nenactment, a court could grant relief on a second-or- successive \npetition, then known as an \u201cabusive\u201d petition, if the petitioner could show that \u201ca fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.\u201d  Section 2244(b)(2)(B) limits the \nexception to cases in which \u201cthe factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,\u201d and the petitioner can establish that no reasonable factfinder \u201cwould have found [her] guilty of the underlying offense\u201d by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d  Congress thus required second -or-successive habeas petitioners attempting to benefit from \nthe miscarriage of justice exception to meet a higher level of proof (\u201cclear and co nvincing evidence\u201d) and to satisfy a diligence \nrequirement that did not exist prior to AEDPA\u2019 s passage.  \n \nMcQuiggin v. Perkins , 569 U.S. 383, 395\u201396 (2013).    \nV. DISCUSSION  \nPetitioner\u2019s second habeas Petition asserts two grounds for relief.  In Claim One, Petitioner \ncontends that he is entitled to a new trial because the FBI Special Agent was a material witness \nand his perjured testimony regarding microscopically matching hair evidence obtained from the victim and Petitioner violated Petitioner\u2019s due proces s rights.  (D.I. 2 at 5; D.I. 4 at 11-15).  In \nClaim Two, Petitioner asserts that, pursuant to State v. Hubbard, 2011 WL 4965286 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 29, 2011), there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for first degree 9 kidnapping because  the State failed to prove the elements of \u201charm\u201d and \u201crelease.\u201d  (D.I. 2 at 7; \nD.I. 4 at 18-27).   \nA. Claim One: FBI Special Agent\u2019s Testimony  \nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends that the USDOJ\u2019s May 15, 2015 letter demonstrates that \nthe FBI Special Agent\u2019s testimony on the microscopic hair analysis comparison constituted \nperjury, thereby establishing that his conviction was obtained in violation of his due process rights.  In his first petitio n, Petitioner did not argue that the Agent\u2019s testimony constituted perjury or that \nthe admission of the testimony violated his due process rights .\n3  Consequently, Claim One is new. \n \n3  Although the Court concludes that Petitioner could not have discovered that the Agent\u2019s \ntestimony was flawed in the manner identified by the USDOJ prior to receiving the \nMay 2015 letter, Petitioner did consistently challenge the reliability of the Agent\u2019s \ntestimon y.  For instance, on direct appeal, Petitioner argued there was insufficient evidence \nto support his conviction, premised in part on his argument that the expert\u2019s testimony was \u201csuspect\u201d and \u201cbased on a science that is simply not exact.\u201d  (D.I. 11 -3 at 29-30).  In his \nfirst Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that that defense counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the Agent\u2019s hair comparison analysis testimony or presenting testimony from another expert about the unreliability of hair comparisons.  Se e State v. Crump , 1988 WL \n109381, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 18, 1988).  The Superior Court determined that \nPetitioner was not prejudiced because the Agent conceded on cross -examination that \u201chair \ncomparison does not constitute a basis for positive person al identification.\u201d  Id . at *3.   In \nhis first federal habeas petition, Petitioner argued that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony on the unreliability of hair samples as identification.  (D.I. 11-13 at 11).  Judge Farnan denied that argument, opining: \n \n[I]f by this argument [Petitioner] means to imply that counsel failed to \ndiscredit the testimony of the agent, the Court concludes that this argument is without merit as well.  The Court finds that counsel vigorously attacked the reliability of the hair sample evidence in question on cross -examination.  \nIn particular, counsel was successful in getting the agent to admit that hair sample analysis is not as positive an identification as a fingerprint.  \n As to [Petitioner\u2019s] con tention that counsel should have presented expert \ntestimony on the unreliability of hair samples for personal identification purposes, the Court first notes that counsel was able to elicit a concession to this effect on cross -examination (\u201chair comparison does not constitute a \nbasis for positive personal identification.\u201d).  In fact, counsel\u2019s entire cross -\nexamination of the agent called into question the reliability of hair samples as a method of positive identification.  The Court concludes that petitioner  10 Given the circumstances surrounding the USDOJ\u2019s \u201creview of microscopic hair comparison \nreports and testimony presented by the FBI Laboratory before December 31, 1999,\u201d the Court concludes that Petitioner could not have discovered the information contained in the USDOJ\u2019s letter earlier through the exercise of due diligence.\n4  Therefore, he has established cause for not \npresenting Claim One in hi s first petition.  ( See D.I. 11 -18 at 132- 33). \nHaving determined that Petitioner established cause, the Court must consider whether he \ncan show prejudice.  Petitioner asserts that the Agent was a material witness and, therefore, any \nevidence that discredit s the Agent\u2019s testimony is material because th e hair analysis testimony was \nthe primary evidence of identification.  The Court cannot dispute that the Agent\u2019s hair analysis testimony played an important role in the identification of Petitioner.  Indeed, the State\u2019s closing \nargument discussed the importance of the hair comparison evidence to identify Petitioner.  \n(D.I.  11-12 at 28- 29).  Nevertheless, on cross -examination, the Agent acknowledged that hair \ncomparison does not constitute a basis for positive personal identification, and testified that, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to mislead anybody into thinking a hair is a fingerprint.\u201d  (D.I. 11- 17 at 51).  This \n \nhas failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective \nstandard of reasonableness.  \n(D.I. 11- 13 at 15 -16).  Although Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument in \nhis first petition and his perjury/due process argument i n this proceeding both challenge \nthe reliability of the Agent\u2019s testimony and the effect the unreliable testimony had during the guilt phase of Petitioner\u2019s trial, the differences between the two are enough to find that Claim One in this proceeding is a ne w claim.  \n \n4  The Court notes that the USDOJ did send a letter to Petitioner on September 12, 2014 informing him in general terms about the problems with the Agent\u2019s testimony.  Petitioner contacted the public defender\u2019s office at that time, and it even ap pears that he drafted a pro \nse Rule 61 motion in September 2014 concerning the information provided by the USDOJ.  \n(D.I. 11- 18 at 118- 19).  These events do not alter the Court\u2019s determination that Petitioner \nhas demonstrated cause for not raising Claim One  in his first petition , because he still did \nnot have the relevant information concerning the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d until long after his first habeas petition  was denied .  11 concession put the jury on notice that the Agent\u2019s testimony was not completely definitive with \nrespect to identifying Petitioner as the victim\u2019s assailant.  During closing, defense counsel \nreiterated the Agent\u2019s testimony, stating:  \nAnd then by a special paragraph, so there can be no \nmisunderstanding, it\u2019s pointed out that hair comparisons do not \nconstitute a basis for positive person identification.  Does not \nconstitute a basis for positive personal identification.  Now, that just \ncan\u2019t be any clearer.  If you believe the FBI, then you cannot believe , \nunder the proper legal standards, that [Petitioner] is the person who \ncommitted the alleged rape.  \n \n(D.I. 4 -1 at 16, 79) .  The trial court instructed the jury that \u201cthe testimony of an expert is to be tried \nlike other testimony, receive as much weight and credit as you think it is entitled to receive when \nyou view it in connection with all the other evidence in the case.\u201d  (D.I. 4 -1 at 98) .  All of these \nfacts demonstrate that, despite the Agent\u2019s co nclusions regarding the hair analysis, the jury was \naware that the Agent\u2019s conclusions did not necessarily constitute a positive identification of Petitioner.  \nThe jury was also presented with the victim\u2019s testimony identifying Petitioner as her \nattacker an d validating the transcript of her   police  interview on November 23, 1981 that was taped \nthe same night of the rape .  Petitioner testified, presented his alibi, and stated that he had never \nseen the victim before.  The jury\u2019s verdict demonstrates that they  rejected Petitioner\u2019s alibi \ntestimony.  \nIn sum, even if the jury had been presented with the USDOJ\u2019s determination regarding the \ninvalidity of the Agent\u2019s testimony, the Court concludes tha t a rational juror could have found \nPetitioner guilty of rape based upon the victim\u2019s testimony .  Consequently, Petitioner has failed to \ndemonstrate prejudice, because he has not shown that the Agent\u2019s testimony worked to his actual \nand substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dime nsions.  12 Having con cluded that Petitioner did not demonstrate prejudice, the Court must determine \nwhether Petitioner has shown that the dismissal of his Petition would result in a fundamental \nmiscarriage of justice.  This is a difficult standard to satisfy,  and the Supreme Court has advised \nthat review should be granted under this exception only in \u201cextraordinary instances.\u201d  McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1470.  The Court concludes that this case is not one of those instances.   \nThe Third Circuit established a two- step inquiry for deciding claims of actual innocence.  \nSee Hubbard v. Pinchak , 378 F.3d 333, 340 (3d Cir. 2004); Goldblum , 510 F.3d 204, 225 (3d Cir. \n2007) (reaffirming two -step inquiry).  First, a court must decide \u201cwhether the [petitioner] has \npresented new reliable evidence .  . . not presented at trial.\u201d   Hubbard, 378 F.3d at 340.  \u201cNew \nreliable evidence\u201d includes \u201cexculpatory, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence that was not presented at trial. \u201d  Schlup, 513 U.S. at 324.  Second, if the petitioner presents  \n\u201cnew evidence not considered by the jury,\u201d  then a court must determine \u201cwhether it is more likely \nthan not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in light of the new evidence.\u201d  \nHubbard, 378 F.3d at 340.  \nPetitioner\u2019s new evidence is the USDOJ\u2019s determination that the following three categories \nof the Special Agent\u2019s testimony exceeded the limits of science: (1) \u201cthe examiner stated or implied that the evidentiary hair could be associated with a specific i ndividual to the exclusion of all \nothers;\u201d (2) \u201cthe examiner assigned to the positive association a statistical weight or probability or provided a likelihood or rareness of the positive association that could lead the jury to believe that valid statistica l weight can be assigned to a microscopic hair association;\u201d or (3) \u201cthe examiner \ncites the number of cases or hair analyses worked in the laboratory and the number of samples \nfrom different individuals that could not be distinguished from one another as a  predictive value \nto bolster the conclusion that a hair belongs to a specific individual.\u201d  (D.I. 11- 12 at 17) .  The Court 13 presumes that the USDOJ\u2019s determination that the Agent\u2019s testimony \u201cexceeded the limits of \nscience and [was], therefore, invalid\u201d con stitutes new reliable evidence, and it definitely was not \npresented at trial.  Therefore, Petitioner has satisfied the first step of the actual innocence inquiry. \nIn order for Petitioner to satisfy the  second step, the Court must be persuaded that, in ligh t \nof the old evidence presented at trial and the new evidence presented here (the USDOJ\u2019s letter and \ndetermination), no juror acting reasonably would have voted to find Petitioner guilty of rape.  Petitioner does not satisfy this standard .  At trial, the FBI Special Agent testified as an expert \nwitness for the State about his conclusions from performing microscopic hair comparison analysis.  \nOn the victim\u2019s jacket, the Special Agent found a \u201cdark brown pubic hair of Negroid origin.\u201d  (D.I.  11-17 at 42) .  The Special Agent \u201ccompared that pubic hair to the hairs of [Petitioner]\u201d and \ndetermined that \u201cthey microscopically matched.\u201d  (Id.).  The Special Agent also found \u201ctwenty \ncharacteristics in that unknown pubic hair which were arranged in exact ly the same manner as the \ncharacteristics in [Petitioner\u2019s] pubic hairs.\u201d  (D.I. 11 -17 at 43) .  On the victim\u2019s knit cap, the \nSpecial Agent found \u201ca dark brown Negroid head hair\u201d that \u201cmicroscopically matched the head hairs of [Petitioner].\u201d   (Id.).  Similar to the pubic hairs, the Special Agent found that the unknown \nhead hair and Petitioner\u2019s head hair shared twenty characteristics arranged in the same manner.  (D.I. 11- 17 at 44) .  Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the Special Agent stated that he had \ncompared hairs from 10,000 individuals and had only encountered two occasions in which two \nindividuals had the same type of hair characteristics and he could not distinguish them.  (D.I. 11-17 at 44- 45).  The Special Agent claimed that he had never \u201chad an oc casion where [he] had a \nhead hair and a pubic hair from one person and [he] could not distinguish it from any other person.\u201d  \n(D.I. 11- 17 at 45) .  14 Nevertheless, the Special Agent also made multiple concessions about the limits of \nmicroscopic hair compariso n analysis.  During defense counsel\u2019s cross -examination, the Special \nAgent conceded that hair comparison analysis was not like a fingerprint and that \u201cno two hairs are \nwhat we call identical.\u201d  (D.I. 11 -17 at 47) .  The Special Agent also acknowledged that \u201ca person \nmay have hair which is not unique in the population.\u201d  (D.I. 11- 17 at 48) .  During further cross -\nexamination, the Special Agent conceded that he \u201ccannot positively make a personal identification from the samples that [he] had.\u201d  (D.I. 11 -17 at 56) .  During redirect examination, the Special \nAgent noted that his report contained a disclaimer that microscopic hair comparison analysis was not a means for personal identification because the FBI did not want people \u201cto think it\u2019s like a fingerprint\u201d and that \u201c[w]hen [the FBI] match[es] a hair to a particular person, it\u2019s a very strong \nassociation but, again, it\u2019s not a fingerprint, so [the FBI] do[es not] want to mislead anybody.\u201d (Id.).  \nAlso at trial, the jury was presented with the victim\u2019s testimony and positive in -court \nidentification of Petitioner.  The jury was aware of the lapse of time between the rape itself and the victim\u2019s identification of Petitioner through a photograph array .  (D.I. 4 -1 at 50- 52).  The jury \nheard in great detail the victim\u2019 s validation of the transcript  of her original tape- recorded  police \nstatement from November 23, 1981 \u2013 the same night of the rape \u2013 and her identification of certain \nerrors in that statement fifteen months  later during the trial.  (D.I. 11- 9 at 4 -5, 20-27).  The jury \nalso heard Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he had never seen the victim before and his alibi that he had been moving furniture between his old apartment and his girlfriend\u2019s apartment, who lived at the same apartment complex as the victim.  (D.I. 4 -1 at 16) . \nThe Court is faced with the following question: \u201c[i]n the context of a reasonable juror\u2019s \nreview of all the evidence, is [the USDOJ\u2019s identification of the errors in the Agent\u2019s test imony]  15 so persuasive and exculpatory that all 12 members of a jury who voted to convict [Petitioner] of \nrape would now change their minds to the end that it is more likely than not that none of them would vote to convict?\u201d  Goldbum , 510 F.3d at 227.  Based on the Court\u2019s review of the record \nprovided for Petitioner\u2019s trial, even if the jury had been presented with the USDOJ\u2019s determination \nregarding the invalidity of the Agent\u2019s testimony, the Court concludes that a rational juror could have found Petitioner guilty of rape based upon the victim\u2019s testimony.  When considered with the \nvictims\u2019 testimony, the errors with the Agent\u2019s testimony do not rise to \u201ca colorable showing of factual innocence\u201d necessary to show a fundamental miscarriage of justice.   \nThus, since Petitioner cannot establish prejudice or a miscarriage of justice under pre -\nAEDPA law, the Court must apply the gatekeeping provision in \u00a7 2244(b) to determine if \nPetitioner can proceed with Claim One.  See Min arik, 166 F.3d at 602.   \n1. Section  2244(b)(2)(B)(i)  \nGiven the circumstances behind the USDOJ\u2019s September 12, 2014 and May 15, 2015 \nletter s to Petitioner , the Court finds that Petitioner could not have discovered the factual predicate \nfor the claim previously through the exercise of due diligence.  As a result, Petitioner satisfies \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i).    \n2. Section 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), a petitioner seeking to have the merits of his second or \nsuccessive petition considered must demonstrate his actual innocence under a higher level of  proof \nthan that required to establish actual innocence in other habeas contexts, such as procedural default \nand the statute of limitations.  See generally  McQuiggin, 569 U.S. 383 (statute of limitations \ncontext); Schlup, 513 U.S. 298 (procedural default c ontext);  Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, \n558 (1998) (\u201cIt is true that the miscarriage of justice standard . . . [for purposes of recalling a \nmandate] is somewhat more lenient than the standard in \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B).\u201d).   To establish actual 16 innocence, a petitioner must put forth \u201cnew reliable evidence \u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific \nevidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014that was not presented \nat trial and that proves that no reasonable juror would have voted to find him guilty beyond a \nreasonable doubt.\u201d  Hubbard v. Pinchak , 378 F3d 333, 339- 40 (3d Cir. 2003).  Demonstrating \nactual innocence is \u201ca burdensome task,\u201d Satterfield  v. Dist. Att\u2019y Philadelphia , 872 F.3d 152, 163 \n(3d Cir. 2017), and merely repackaging the existing trial record, Hubbard, 378 F.3d at 341, or asserting conclusory claims of actual innocence, Couch v. Phelps , 671 F. Supp. 2d 559, 562 \n(D. Del. 2009), is insufficient to meet this standard.   \nPetitioner contends that his conviction violated the due process clause because it was based \non the FBI Special Agent\u2019s perjured testimony, with the falsity of the testimony being demonstrated by the USDOJ\u2019s May 2015 letter.  In order to satisfy \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), Petitioner must sh ow that, after considering the newly discovered additional evidence of the errors in the FBI \nSpecial Agent\u2019s testimony with all the evidence in the record, no reasonable factfinder would have \nconvicted him.  See House , 547 U.S. at 538. \nIn determining whether Petitioner can satisfy  \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), the Court incorporates  \nits prior discussion of the evidence as set forth in its discussion of the miscarriage of justice exception to the abuse of the writ doctrine.  See supra at Section V. A.  Additionally, however, the \nCourt considers  evidence in Petitioner\u2019s record that was obtained after his conviction and the \ndismissal of his first habeas petition.\n5  Notably, s ometime between 2000 and 2003, Forensic \n \n5  Nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) limits the Court\u2019s inq uiry regarding \nthe facts underlying the claim to evidence offered by Petitioner.  See  House , 547 U.S. at \n538 (the phrase \u201cevidence as a whole\u201d includes \u201call the evidence, old and new, \nincriminating and exculpatory, without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted \nunder rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.\u201d); see also Munchinski , 694 F.3d at \n337-39.  In fact, the 2003 Forensic Science Associates report that the Court considers under \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) was written at the behest of the Innocence Project on Petitioner\u2019s 17 Science Associates, on behalf of the Innocence Project,  extracted a DNA profile from spermatozoa \nfound on a comb used for the victim\u2019s pubic combing and compared the profile to the one obtained \nfrom Petitioner\u2019s oral swab.  See Crump , 2017 WL 6403510, at *1.  Forensic Science Associates \nconcluded in its 2003 r eport that Petitioner \u201ccannot be eliminated as the source of the spermatozoa \nrecovered from the tines of the [victim\u2019s] pubic comb,\u201d and stated that \u201cthese findings fail to support [Petitioner\u2019s] claims of factual innocence.\u201d  (D.I. 11- 18 at 98) .  Although Petitioner \ncontends that the DNA evidence tested by Forensic Science Associates was possibly contaminated, his assertions are speculative.   (See D.I. 17 at 2-3).   In short, the DNA test results from April 2003 \nlink Petitioner to the crimes of conv iction  and undermine his claims of innocence.     \nThus, after considering  the totality of the evidence  in Petitioner\u2019s record at the time of his \nfiling the instant Petition, the  Court concludes that the  USDOJ\u2019s determination regarding the \nAgent\u2019s testimony  does not prove clearly and convincingly that no reasonable juror would have \nvoted to find Petitioner  guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, Claim One must be dismissed  \nas successive. \nB. Claim  Two: Insufficient Evidence of First Degree Kidnapping  \nIn Cl aim Two, Petitioner contends that the Delaware decision Hubbard shows that there \nwas insufficient evidence to convict him of first -degree kidnapping because the victim was \nreleased unharmed as a matter of law .  Claim Two\u2019s argument concerning the State\u2019s f ailure to \nprove the elements of harm and \u201cno release\u201d is new.  It was not presented in Petitioner\u2019s first petition and, therefore, under pre -AEDPA law, he may only proceed with Claim Two if he \n \nbehalf.  The report addresses the validity of the Agent\u2019s testimony (D.I. 11-18 at 51-54) \nand Petitioner\u2019s allegation of actual innocence  (D.I. 11- 18 at 98 -99), and, therefore, \naddresses  the constitutional error that Petitioner alleges occurred at trial .   18 demonstrates cause and prejudice for failing to raise it in his  earlier petition , or that a miscarriage \nof justice will occur if the Claim is not considered .  \nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to establish cause by asserting that the argument in Claim \nTwo was unavailable until the Superior Court decided Hubbard in 2011, the attempt is unavailing.  \nAlthough the Hubbard decision itself was only issued in 2011, Petitioner always had the ability to \nargue that the State did not prove all of the elements of first degree kidnapping.  In other words, \nthe underlying insufficient evidence argument was available \u2013 Petitioner just failed to raise it \nduring his trial, on direct appeal, in his first Rule 61 proceeding, or in his first federal habeas petition.   \nPetitioner also cannot demonstrate that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result \nfrom a failure to entertain his argument regarding Hubbard.  Petitioner\u2019s argument that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to convict him fails to demonstrate his factual innocence.  See Bousley v. United States , 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998).  \nThus, since Petitioner cannot establish prejudice or a miscarriage of justice under pre -\nAEDPA law, the Court must apply the gatekeeping provision in \u00a7 2244(b) to determine if Petitioner can proceed with Claim Two.  See Minarik, 166 F.3d at 602.   \n1. Section 2244(b)(2)(B)(i)  \nPetitioner\u2019s argument in Claim Two does not satisfy \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i).  The Superior \nCourt decided Hubbard in 2011, yet Petitioner waited until 2015 to raise the issue in the Delaware \nstate courts and until 2019 to raise the issue in his successive Petition.  Additionally, t he argument \npresented in Hubbard \u2013 that rape cannot constitute the harm element for kidnapping \u2013 has been \navailable to Petitioner since he was convicted in 1985.  He has not provided any reason for not raising th is argument earlier.  Thus, the Court concludes that Petitioner has not satisfied the \ndiligence requirement of \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i).  19 2. Section  2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) \nPetitioner \u2019s second argument  also fails to satisfy 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). \u201c[A]ctual innocence \nmeans factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d  Bousley , 523 U.S. at  623 (1998).  Claim \nTwo asserts an argument that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to support his \nconviction for first degree kidnapping based on a subsequent interpretation of a legal innocence, not actual innocence .  Therefore, Claim Two fails to satisfy the requirements of  \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii).  \nBased on the foregoing, the Court will dismiss Petitioner\u2019s second and successive Petition \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  \nVI. ONE -YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  \nEven if the Petition w as not successive, and the Court had the authority to grant relief, the \nCourt would dismiss the Petition as time -barred.  The AEDPA prescribes a one -year period of \nlimitations for the filing of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which begins to run from the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion \nof direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;  \n (B) the date on which the impedim ent to filing an application created \nby State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action;  \n (C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or  \n (D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.  \n 20 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).  AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling, \nwhich , when applicable, may extend the filing period.  See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 645 \n(2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling) .  A petitioner may also be \nexcused from failing to comply with the limitations period by making a  gateway showing of actual \ninnocence .  See Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F. 4th  133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual innocence exception).  \nPetitioner asserts that May 15, 2015 (the date of the USDOJ\u2019s letter forwarding a copy of \nthe letter it sent to the Delaware Department of Justice) constitutes the starting date for Claim One under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) .  The Court is not persuaded.  The record reveals that the first letter \nPetitioner received from the USDOJ was dated September 12, 2014, and that he had drafted a pro se Rule 61 motion based on that letter by September 17, 2014.  (D.I. 11- 18 at 118- 121).  Given \nthese circumstances, the Court views September 17, 2014 as the relevant starting date under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).  Applying the one -year limitations period to that date, Petitioner had until \nSeptember 1 7, 2015 to timely file Claim One.  See Wilson v. Beard , 426 F.3d 653, 662- 64 (3d Cir. \n2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n.3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA\u2019s one -year limitations period is calculated \naccording to the anniversary met hod, i.e., the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the \ndate it began to run).   \nAs for Claim Two, the Court assumes, without deciding, that the starting date for the \nlimitations period is the date of the Hubbard decision \u2013 September 29, 2011.  See \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).  \nWhich would mean that Petitioner had until October 1, 2012\n6 to file Claim Two in a timely manner.   \n \n6  The last day of the limitations period fell on Saturday September 29, 2012.  21 Petitioner, however, did not file the instant Petition until September 3, 2019,7 almost four \nfull years after the deadline for Claim One and approximately seven years after the deadline for \nClaim Two.  Therefore, both Claims are time -barred unless the limitations period can be statutorily \nor equitably tolled, or Petitioner demonstrates a convincing claim of actual innocence excusing his untimely filing.   \nThe Court will discuss each doctrine in turn. \nA. Statutory  Tolling  \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post -conviction motion tolls AEDPA\u2019s \nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post -\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period.  See Swartz v. Meyers , 204 F.3d 417, 420- 24 (3d Cir. 2000).  An \nuntimely post -conviction motion is not considered to be properly filed for \u00a7 2244(d)(2) purposes.  \nSee Pace v. DiGuglielmo , 544 U.S. 408, 414, 417 (2005)  (explaining that a state postconviction \npetition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \u201c properly filed\u201d within the meaning of \n\u00a7 2244(d)(2) ).  The limitations period is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a \npost- conviction decision could be filed even if the appeal is not eventually filed.  See Pace , \n544 U.S.  at 424.  The limitations period, however, is not tolled during the ninety days a petitioner \nhas to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state post -conviction motion.  See Stokes v. Dist. Attorney of Philadelphia, \n247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir. 2001).   \n \n7  The Court adopts September 3, 2019 as the filing date, because that is the date on which \nPetitioner signed his motion for permission to file a second or successive petition.  (D.I. 1-1 at 5); see Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761 (3d Cir. 2003) (the date on which a \nprisoner transmitted documents to prison authorities for mailing is to be considered the actual filing date).   22 Petitioner filed his  second  Rule 61 motion in the Superior Court on June 12, 2015.  Since \nthe one -year limitations period for Claim Two expired on October 1, 2012, the Rule 61 motion \ndoes not have any statutory tolling effect for Claim Two. \nAs for C laim One, 268 days of the limitations period had already lapsed when Petitioner \nfiled his second Rule 61 motion on June 12, 2015.  The Rule 61 motion tolled the limitations period \nthrough September 18, 2018, the date on which the Delaware Supreme Court denied Petitioner\u2019s \nrequest for rehearing en banc .  See Lawrence v. Florida , 549 U.S. 327, 329 (2007).  The  limitations \nclock started to run again on September 19, 2018,8 and ran the remaining ninety- seven days until \nthe limitations period expired on December 26, 2018.9   \nConsequently, even with the applicable statutory tolling, both Claims One and Two are \ntime-barred, unless equitable tolling or the actual innocence exception apply. \nB. Equitable Tolling and Actual Innocence Exception to the Statute of \nLimitations   \nAEDPA\u2019s  one- year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare \ncircumstances when the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, \nand (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d  Holland, 560 U.S. at 649- 50.  With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not \navailable where the late filing is due to the petitioner\u2019s excusable neglect.   Id. at 651-52.  As for \nthe extraordinary circumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with \n \n8  The limitations period was not tolled during the pendency of Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ \nof certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.  See Lawrence v. Florida , 549 U.S. 327, \n329 (2007).   \n \n9  The limitations period actually expired on December 25, 2018, a federal holiday.  Therefore, the limitations period extended through the end of the day on December  26, 2018.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(2)(C). 23 respect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one- year deadline.\u201d  Pabon v. Mahanoy , 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. \n2011).  An ext raordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal \nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner\u2019s failure to file \na timely federal petition.\u201d  Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013); see also  Wallace v. \nMahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 144 (3d Cir. 2021) (reiterating that the relevant inquiry for purposes of \nassessing extraordinary circumstances is \u201chow severe an obstacle [the circumstance] creates with \nrespect to meeting AEDPA \u2019s one -year deadline.\u201d).  Moreover, \u201cif the person seeking equitable \ntolling  has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the extraordinary  \ncircumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary circumstances and the failure \nto file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did not prevent timely filing.\u201d \nBrown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768, 773 (3d Cir. 2003).  The burden is on the petitioner to prove that \nhe has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights.  See Urcinoli v. Cathel,  546 F.3d 269, 277 \n(3d Cir. 2008). \nIn addition, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that \ncan overcome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one- year limitations period.  See McQuiggin, 569 U.S. at 392; \nWallace , 2 F. 4th at 150- 151.  A petitioner satisfies the actual innocence exception by \n(1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his innocence; and (2) showing \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201ca reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new evidence.\u201d  Wallace , 2 F.  4th at 151.   \nPetitioner does not assert that any extraordinary circumstance prevented him from filing \nClaim One within one year of receiving the first USDOJ letter or from filing Claim Two within one-year of the Hubbard decision.  Nor has Petitioner demonstrated that he exercised reasonable \ndiligence in presenting Claims One and Two to this Court.  With respect to Claim One, a s 24 previously discussed, the Forensic Science Associates report issued in April 2003 on Pe titioner\u2019s \nbehalf identified numerous errors in the Special Agent\u2019s testimony that were similar to the errors \nidentified by the USDOJ in 2015.  ( See D.I. 11- 18 at 51- 54).  Yet, Petitioner does not explain why \nhe waited until 2019 to file the instant Petition.  As for Claim Two, Petitioner has not provided \nany explanation for waiting more than seven years after the Hubbard decision to seek habeas relief.  \nPetitioner\u2019s unexplained delays suggest that he did not exercise the diligence necessary to trigger equitable tolling.  \nTo the extent Petitioner  asserts that he should be excused from complying with the \nlimitations period  for Claim One  because the information provided in the USDOJ\u2019s May 2015 \nletter demonstrates his actual innocence, his argument is unavailing.  At most, the USDOJ\u2019s May 2015 letter provides a reason  for inquiring into the identification of Petitioner as the victim\u2019s \nattacker \u2013 the information, on its own, does not prove his actual innocence.  Significantly, t he DNA \ntesting result from the Forensic Science Associates 2003 report links Petitioner to the crimes for \nwhich he was convicted and directly disproves his claims of innocence for the rape conviction.   \nPetitioner\u2019s argument in Claim Two that the evidence p resented at trial was legally insufficient to \nsatisfy the harm element for first degree kidnapping also does not establish his factual innocence.  See Bousley , 523 U.S. at 623 (\u201c[A]ctual innocence means factual innocence, not mere legal \ninsufficiency.\u201d ).   \nBased on the forgoing, the Court concludes that neither the doctrine of equitable tolling \nnor the actual innocence equitable exception are  available to Petitioner on the facts he has \npresented.   Accordingly, even if the instant Claims were not barred as s econd or successive, they \nwould be dismissed as time -barred.  25 VII. CERTIFICATE  OF APPEALABILITY  \nWhen a district court issues a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition, the court must also \ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011).  A certificate \nof appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a \nconstitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional c laims debatable or wrong.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2);  Slack v. \nMcDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).  If a federal court denies a habeas petition on procedural \ngrounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling.  Id.  \nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition fails to warrant federal habeas relief, and \nis persuaded that reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable.  Therefore, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.  \nVIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, the Court will dismiss the instant successive Petition because both \nClaims are barred by 28 U.S.C.\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii).  The Court declines to issue a certificate of \nappealability.  An appropriate Order shall issue."}
