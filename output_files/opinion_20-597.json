SANDERS , \nPetitioner , \nV. \nROBERT MAY, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE , \nRespondent. \nI. BACKGROUND Civil Action No. 20-597-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nIn 1994, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner Charles B. Sanders of \nrobbery, kidnapping , and assault. See Sanders v. State, 115 A.3d 1215 (Table), 2015 WL \n3766447, at *1 (Del. June 12, 2015). The Superior Court sentenced him to a total of forty years' \nincarceration. See Sanders v. State, 734 A.2d 160 (Table), 1999 WL 507240, at *1 (Del. June 9, \n1999). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed his convictions and sentence on direct appeal. \nSee Sanders v. State, 660 A.2d 395 (Table), 1995 WL 264532, at *4 (Del. May 1, 1995). \nThroughout the years following his conviction , Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court at \nleast eight motions for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule \n61 (\"Rule 61 motions\"), all of which the Delaware Superior Court has denied. See Sanders, \n2015 WL 3 7 6644 7, at * 1 ( affirming denial of Petitioner 's fifth and sixth Rule 61 motions and \ndiscussing dismissal of his prior Rule 61 motions) ; Sanders v. State, 145 A.3d 429 (Table), 2016 \nWL 4191923, at *l (Del. Aug. 1, 2016) (affirming the dismissal of Petitioner 's eighth Rule 61 \nmotion); State v. Sanders, 1997 WL 855719 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 17, 1997) (denying Petitioner 's second Rule 61 motion). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed all of those \njudgments. See Sanders v. State, 91 A.3d 562 (Table), 2014 WL 1878757 (Del. May 7, 2014) \n(affirming denial of Petitioner 's fourth Rule 61 motion); Sanders, 2015 WL 3766447, at *1 \n(affirming denial of Petitioner 's fifth and sixth Rule 61 motions); Sanders, 2016 WL 4191923, at \n* 1 ( affirming denial of Petitioner 's eighth Rule 61 motion). \nIn March 1996, Petitioner filed in this Court a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\"first habeas petition\") challenging his 1994 convictions. (See \ngenerally Sanders v. Brady, Civ. A. No. 96-167-RRM ) On March 17, 1997, the Honorable \nRoderick M. McKelvie denied the petition in its entirety. (See D.I. 56 in Sanders v. Brady, Civ. \nA. No. 96-167-RRM) Petitioner appealed that decision, and the Third Circuit denied Petitioner 's \nrequest for a certificate of appealability . (See id. at D.I. 63 & D.I. 72) In 1998, the Third Circuit \ndenied Petitioner 's motion for leave for authorization to file a second habeas corpus petition. \n(See id.at D.I. 75) \nIn November 1997, Petitioner filed in this Court a second habeas petition (\"second \nhabeas petition\"). (See Sanders v. Kearney, Civ. A. No. 97-631-LON at D.I. 2) The Honorable \nJoseph J. Longobardi granted the State's motion to dismiss Petitioner 's second petition and \ndismissed that petition on February 4, 1998. (See id. at D.I. 10) \nIn July 1999, Petitioner filed in this Court a motion to file a second application for habeas \nrelief. (See Sanders v. State, Civ. A. No. 99-481-LON at D.I. 2) Judge Longobardi denied the \nmotion, and the Third Circuit denied Petitioner 's request for a certificate of appealability in \nFebruary 2000. (See id. at D.I. 1 & D.I. 8) \n2 In December 2015, Petitioner filed another habeas petition (\"third habeas petition\") \nchallenging his 1993 convictions -but this time he filed it in the District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. (See Sanders v. Johnson, Civ. A. No. 16-09-RGA at D.I. 1) The \nEastern District of Pennsylvania transferred Petitioner 's third habeas petition to this Court. (See \nid. at D.I. 2 & D.I. 3) After the transfer, Petitioner filed a motion acknowledging that his third \nhabeas petition constituted a second or successive petition, which also asked this Court to \ntransfer the petition to the Third Circuit. (See id. at D.I. 4) The Court granted Petitioner's \nmotion to transfer the case, and closed the case. (See id. at D.I. 7) The Third Circuit eventually \ndismissed Petitioner's request for leave to file a second or successive petition due to his failure to \ncomply with one of its orders. See In re: Charles B. Sanders, Jr., C.A. No. 16-2735, Order (3d \nCir. Sept. 12, 2016). \nIn September 2018, Petitioner filed another request in the Third Circuit seeking \npermission to file a second or successive habeas petition See In re: Charles Sanders, C.A. No. \n18-2942 (3d Cir. Sept. 4, 2018). The Third Circuit denied that request on November 6, 2018, \nexplaining that Petitioner \"meets neither the pre-AEDPA standard for a second or successive \npetition[ ... ] nor the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2).\" Id. at Order (3d Cir. Nov. 6, \n2018). The Third Circuit denied Petitioner 's motion for rehearing en bane on November 30, \n2018. See id. at Order (3d Cir. Nov. 30, 2018). \nIn April 2020, Petitioner filed in this Court a document titled \"Motion for Relief from an \nOrder under Rule 60(b)(l) and (6)\" (\"Motion \"). (D.I. 1) According to the Motion, the Delaware \nSuperior Court denied Petitioner 's petition for a writ of mandamus seeking an order requiring the \nState to provide evidence regarding two photographic lineups utilized prior to his trial and \n3 subsequent convictions in 1994. (D.I. 1 at 7, 18) Petitioner asserts that the State's failure to turn \nover the requested evidence violated Brady v. Maryland. (D.I. 1 at 18) He appears to be asking \nthis Court to reverse or vacate the Delaware court's denial of his writ of mandamus and order the \nState to provide him with the requested evidentiary material. (D .I. 1 at 1-7, 18) \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of someone \nin custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that his custody violates \nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); see also Estelle v. \nMcGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Notably, a district court may summarily dismiss a habeas \npetition \"if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the \npetitioner is not entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. \nAdditionally , pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), a petitioner must seek authorization \nfrom the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive habeas petition in a \ndistrict court. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007); Rule 9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a72254. \nNotably, a petition for habeas relief is not considered to be \"second or successive simply \nbecause it follows an earlier federal petition.\" Benchoff v. Colleran, 404 F .3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. \n2005). Rather, a habeas petition is classified as second or successive within the meaning of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244 if a prior petition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new petitions \nchallenge the same conviction , and the new petition asserts a claim that was, or could have been, \nraised in a prior habeas petition. See Benchoff, 404 F.3d at 817; In re Olabode, 325 F.3d 166, \n169-73 (3d Cir. 2003). If a habeas petitioner erroneously files a second or successive habeas \npetition \"in a district court without the permission of a court of appeals, the district court's only \n4 option is to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1631.\" Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002). \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nAlthough presented as a motion for reconsideration filed pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure 60(b ), Petitioner 's instant filing essentially challenges the validity of his \n1994 convictions . Therefore , the Court construes the instant Motion to be a request for federal \nhabeas relief. \nThe record in this case reveals that Petitioner 's first federal habeas petition was \nadjudicated on the merits, the instant Petition challenges the same 1994 convictions that were \nchallenged in his first petition, and the instant Petition also asserts claims that either were or \ncould have been asserted in his first and subsequent petitions. See Benchoff, 404 F .3d at 817-18. \nAs a result, the Court concludes that the instant Motion constitute s a second or successive habeas \npetition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. \nPetitioner does not allege, and the record does not indicate, that the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit authorized the filing of the instant second or successive habeas Petition.1 The \nThird Circuit denied Petitioner 's request for such authorization in November 2018. See In re: \nCharles Sanders, C.A. No. 18-2942, Order (3d Cir. Nov. 6, 2018). Consequentl y, the Court \n1In fact, it appears that Petitioner included an argument almost identical to the argument \npresented here in a 2018 request he filed in the Third Circuit seeking authorization to file a \nsecond or successive habeas petition. See In re: Charles Sanders, C.A. No. 18-2942, \nApplication (3d Cir. Sept. 4, 2018). The Third Circuit denied Petitioner 's request for such \nauthorization in November 2018. See In re: Charles Sanders, C.A. No. 18-2942, Order (3d Cir. \nNov. 6, 2018). \n5 concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to consider the instant Motion. See Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 \n2254; Robinson , 313 F.3d at 139. \nEven if the Court construed the instant Motion as a request for mandamus relief from the \nDelaware court's mandamus denial, Petitioner would not be entitled to relief. A federal court \nmay issue a writ of mandamus only if there is an independent basis for subject matter \njurisdiction See United States v. Christian , 660 F .2d 892, 894 (3d Cir. 1981) (\"Before \nentertaining (a petition for a writ of mandamus , the court] must identify a jurisdiction that the \nissuance of the writ might assist.\"). Federal courts have jurisdiction \"in the nature of mandamus \nto compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty \nowed to plaintiff.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Importantly , however, \"(s]tate courts are not lower courts' \nfrom this Court's perspective , and principles of comity and federalism ensure that a federal court \nordinarily may not issue a writ of mandamus to compel a state court to exercise a jurisdiction \nentrusted to it.\" In re Whiteford , 2013 WL 979413, at* 1 (3d Cir. Mar. 14, 2013). Petitioner \ndoes not allege any action or omission by a federal officer, employee, or agency that this Court \nmight have mandamus jurisdiction to address in the first instance. Therefore, to the extent the \nMotion constitutes a request for mandamus relief, the Court will deny it for lack of jurisdiction . \nSee In re Wolenski, 324 F.2d 309 (3d Cir. 1963) (finding District Court \"had no jurisdiction \" to \n\"issue a writ of mandamus compelling action by a state official\"). \nFinally, the Court concludes that it would not be in the interest of justice to transfer this \ncase to the Third Circuit, because nothing in the instant filing comes close to satisfying the \nsubstantive requirements for a second or successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). \nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the instant Motion for lack of jurisdiction . \n6 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Motion for \nlack of jurisdiction. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because \nPetitioner has failed to make a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. \n1997). A separate Order will be entered. \nJanuary 18, 2022 \nS DISTRICT JUDGE \n7 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCHARLES B.
