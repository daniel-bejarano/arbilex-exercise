{"case_name": "Cipla USA, Inc. v. Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.", "case_number": "22-552", "judge": "Magistrate Judge Sherry R. Fallon", "date": "08-05-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nCIPLA USA, INC., )\nPint\nv. C.A. No. 22-552-VAC-SRF\nIPSEN BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 5th day of August, 2022, the court having considered defendant\nIpsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cIpsen\u201d) motion to stay (D.L. 18), and the briefing and filings\nassociated therewith (D.I. 19; D.I. 22; D.I. 24; D.I. 32), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Ipsen\u2019s\nmotion to stay is DENIED for the following reasons:\n\n1. Background. Ipsen is a biopharmaceutical drug company. (D.I. 1 at 71) In\nAugust 2007, Ipsen began manufacturing Somatuline\u00ae Depot, a drug injection with the active\ningredient lanreotide acetate, to treat rare diseases by slowing the growth of tumors. (Id)\n\n2. InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cInvaGen\u201d), an affiliate of plaintiff Cipla USA,\nInc. (\u201cCipla\u201d), submitted a Section 505(b)(2) application to the Food and Drug Administration\n(\u201cFDA\u201d) to market a lanreotide acetate injection product (\u201cCipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product\u201d).\n(Id. at $2) The FDA approved InvaGen\u2019s application on December 17, 2021. (Id. at 39) The\ncomplaint alleges that the active ingredient, route of administration, and strengths of Cipla\u2019s\nLanreotide Acetate Product are the same as Somatuline\u00ae Depot. (Jd. at { 40)\n\n3. Following FDA approval of Cipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product, the complaint\nalleges that Ipsen\u2019s stock price dropped significantly and Ipsen began making false or misleading\n\nstatements about Cipla and its product. (Jd. at J] 41-47) Among the allegedly false statements\nmade by Ipsen were allegations that Cipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product falls under a separate\nhealthcare billing code from Ipsen\u2019s Somatuline\u00ae Depot product under the Healthcare Common\nProcedure Coding System (\u201cHCPCS\u201d). (/d. at ] 47) According to Cipla, these false or\nmisleading statements have created market confusion regarding health care coverage and\nreimbursement for Cipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product, leading to erosion of Cipla\u2019s sales and\ndamage to Cipla\u2019s reputation and goodwill. (/d. at Ff] 49-52)\n\n4. Cipla filed this suit on April 27, 2022, alleging causes of action for unfair\ncompetition under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) and Delaware common law; deceptive\ntrade practices under the Delaware Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2532;\ntortious interference with economic advantage; and trade libel. (/d. at {] 57-99) On May 4,\n2022, the case was assigned to the court\u2019s Vacant Judgeship docket (the \u201cVAC docket\u201d). (D.I. 6)\n\n5. On June 3, 2022, Ipsen filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction and failure to state a claim under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and\n12(b)(6), respectively. (D.I. 16) Ipsen filed the instant motion to stay discovery pending\nresolution of the motion to dismiss on the same date. (D.I. 18)\n\n6. On July 6, 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) issued a\ndecision creating a new HCPCS Level II code for Cipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product. (D.I. 32,\nEx. A at 10)\n\n7. Legal Standard. District courts have broad discretion in matters concerning case\nmanagement and discovery. See United States v. Schiff, 602 F.3d 152, 176 (3d Cir. 2010);\nSempier v. Johnson & Higgins, 45 F.3d 724, 734 (3d Cir. 1995). Included within this broad\ndiscretion is a district court\u2019s consideration of a motion to stay. See Dentsply Int'l Inc. v. Kerr\n\nMfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990). Courts generally consider three factors in\ndeciding how to exercise their discretion in the context of a motion to stay: (1) whether a stay\nwill simplify the issues for trial; (2) the status of the litigation, particularly whether discovery is\ncomplete and a trial date has been set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to\nsuffer undue prejudice from any delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage.\nSee Am. Axle & Manuf., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS, 2021 WL\n616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021); Harvey v. McBride, C.A. No. 19-1861-CFC et al., 2021\nWL 372511, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 3, 2021). However, consideration of these factors \u201cis not a rigid\ntemplate for decision[,]\u201d and the court retains discretion to consider the totality of circumstances\n\u201cbeyond those captured by the three-factor stay test.\u201d British Telecommc\u2019ns PLC v.\nIAC/InterActiveCorp, C.A. No. 18-366-WCB, 2020 WL 5517283, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 11, 2020)\n(quoting Murata Mach. USA v. Daifuku Co., 830 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). The movant\nbears the burden to show that the circumstances support an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to\nstay. RideShare Displays, Inc. v. Lyft, Inc., C.A. No. 20-1629-RGA-JLH, 2021 WL 7286931, at\n*1 (. Del. Dec. 17, 2021) (citing Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 708 (1997)).\n\n8. Analysis. Based on the court\u2019s consideration of the totality of the circumstances\nin this case, Ipsen\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED. The court\u2019s exercise of its discretion over case\nmanagement is guided by Standing Order No. 2022-VAC-1, dated March 9, 2022 (\u201cStanding\nOrder\u201d), which governs cases such as this one that are assigned to the VAC docket during the\ncurrent judicial vacancy. The Standing Order specifies that \u201c[tJhe filing of a motion shall not be\ngrounds to prevent the case, including discovery, from progressing\u201d until the case is assigned to\nan Article II] Judge. Standing Order at \u00a2 5(f). Ipsen\u2019s proposal to stay discovery until resolution\n\nof the pending motion to dismiss would require a deviation from the Standing Order. In the\ncontext of the overarching guidance provided by the Standing Order, the court turns to an\nanalysis of the three stay factors.\n\n9. Simplification of issues for trial. The first factor does not weigh heavily for or\nagainst a stay at this stage of the proceedings. See Kaavo Inc. v. Cognizant Tech. Sols. Corp.,\nC.A. No.14-1192-LPS-CIJB et al., 2015 WL 1737476, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 9, 2015) (explaining\nthat the court must assess \u201call of the possible outcomes of the . . . inquiry . . . not just the\npotential outcome most favorable to the party seeking the stay.\u201d). Ipsen argues the court\u2019s\nconsideration of its motion to dismiss is likely to result in dismissal of the entire case, and Cipla\ndisputes Ipsen\u2019s position. (D.I. 19 at 8-10; D.I. 22 at 10-11) While the case would be \u201cgreatly\nsimplified\u201d if the motion to dismiss is granted, \u201clittle efficiency gain would be realized\u201d if the\nmotion is denied or granted-in-part. Kaavo, 2015 WL 1737476, at *2.\n\n10. Consideration of the first factor on a motion to stay should not entail an\nevaluation of the legal merits of the motion to dismiss. See Kaavo, 2015 WL 1737476, at *2 n.4.\nMoreover, Ipsen\u2019s focus on the merits of the underlying motion falls outside the scope of the\nreferral to the Magistrate Judge under the Standing Order. See Standing Order at { 5(a).!\n\n11. \u2014_Ipsen contends that the CMS coding decision further supports its position that the\nissues will be simplified by a stay, noting that courts routinely stay litigation when the court\u2019s\ndecision would be aided by an agency\u2019s decision. (D.I. 19 at 10; D.I. 32 at 3-4) But the CMS\ndecision does not undermine Cipla\u2019s allegations that Ipsen made multiple misrepresentations\nabout HCPCS coding for Cipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product which resulted in commercial harm\n\nto Cipla. At the time Ipsen made the alleged misrepresentations about the proper coding of\n\n' The parties may at any time consent to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Judge, limited to\nresolution of a dispositive motion. See Form AO85A.\n\n4\nCipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product, the CMS had not yet reached a decision. (D.I. 1 at ] 47(a),\n59(a)) Yet the complaint alleges Ipsen falsely told customers that their coverage and\nreimbursement for Cipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product would be impacted by HCPCS coding.\n(Id. at F{ 5, 47(c)-(d)) It is the alleged misrepresentations which form the core of Cipla\u2019s\ncomplaint. Cipla contends these representations were false because providers can make their\nown decisions on HCPCS coding before a code is assigned, and the question of coverage is\nindependent from HCPCS coding. (D.I. 1 at f{ 5, 45, 47(c)-(d), 59)\n\n12. Moreover, not all of the alleged misrepresentations identified by Cipla in the\ncomplaint involve HCPCS coding or are otherwise impacted by the CMS decision. The\ncomplaint alleges Ipsen falsely represented Cipla\u2019s position on the therapeutic equivalence of\nCipla\u2019s Lanreotide Acetate Product and Somatuline Depot\u00ae. (D.I. 1 at ff] S(a), 45, 48, 61, 63)\nIpsen does not argue that the CMS decision disposes of this alleged misrepresentation. (D.I. 32\nat 3-4)\n\n13. For these reasons, a determination on the simplification of issues for trial is\npremature prior to the resolution of the motion to dismiss, and the CMS decision does not\nfundamentally alter the analysis on this factor.\n\n14. Status of the litigation. This factor weighs in favor of a stay because the case is\nin its earliest stages, and \u201cthe most burdensome stages of the case[ ] . . . all lie in the future.\u201d\nIOENGINE, LLC v. PayPal Holdings, Inc., C.A. No. 18-452-WCB, 2019 WL 3943058, at *5 (D.\nDel. Aug. 21, 2019). No scheduling order has been entered, discovery has not yet begun, and no\ntrial date has been set. See Neste Oil OYJ v. Dynamic Fuels, LLC, C.A. No. 12-1744-GMS, 2013\n\nWL 3353984, at *5 (D. Del. July 2, 2013).\n15. Undue prejudice. This factor weighs against a stay. There appears to be no\ndispute that Cipla and Ipsen are the only competitors in the market for lanreotide acetate\nproducts. (D.L. 1 at {J 1-2; D.I. 24 at 6) \u201c[W]here, as here, the parties are the only two\ncompetitors in the relevant market, the Court can more easily draw the inference of the increased\nchance of undue prejudice from delay related to a stay.\u201d SenoRx, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc., C.A. No.\n12-173-LPS-CJB, 2013 WL 144255, at *8 n.10 (D. Del. Jan. 11, 2013).\n\n16. \u2014_Ipsen\u2019s contention that the parties\u2019 direct competitor status is only relevant in the\npatent infringement context is not compelling. The complaint in this case alleges loss of market\nshare and a loss of goodwill among customers. (D.I. 1 at {9 49, 52) Regardless of whether the\nharm occurs in the context of patent infringement claims or claims for unfair competition, any\ndelay in adjudicating such a case \u201cwill have outsized consequences for the party asserting\u201d the\nclaims. SenoRx, 2013 WL 144255, at *7; FMC Corp. v. Summit Agro USA, LLC, C.A. No. 14-\n51-LPS-CJB, 2014 WL 3703629, at *5-6 (D. Del. July 21, 2014) (finding some prejudice where\nparties were direct competitors on a motion to stay Lanham Act claims).\n\n17.\u2018 The court further recognizes that \u201cdelay inherently harms a non-moving party by\nprolonging resolution of the dispute, even if the party is not currently a direct competitor.\u201d\nRideShare Displays, Inc. v. Lyft, Inc., C.A. No. 20-1629-RGA-JLH, 2021 WL 7286931, at *1 (D.\nDel. Dec. 17, 2021) (citing Neste Oil, 2013 WL 3353984, at *2).\n\n18. On balance, the totality of the circumstances weighs against the entry of a stay of\ndiscovery in this case. A stay of discovery would contravene the case management directives of\nthe Standing Order and is likely to prejudice Cipla.\n\n19. Conclusion. IT IS ORDERED that, in the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion over\n\ncase management of VAC cases, Defendant\u2019s motion to stay is DENIED.
