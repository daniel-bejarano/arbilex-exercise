For the following reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT the pending motion to\n\ndismiss without prejudice.\n\n! The briefing associated with the pending motions is found at D.I. 6, D.I. 8, and D.I. 10. The\ncourt also solicited supplemental briefing on the applicability of Eleventh Amendment immunity\nto Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action under the Delaware Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act based on Third\nCircuit precedent issued after the completion of briefing on the pending motion. (DI. 11) The\nsupplemental briefing can be found at D.I. 12, D.I. 13, and D.L. 14. In it, the parties agree that\nEleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to the University of Delaware based on a\ndecision issued by this court nearly fifty years ago. See Gordenstein v. Univ. of Delaware, 381\nF. Supp. 718 (D. Del. 1974). According to the parties, factual determinations regarding the\nUniversity of Delaware\u2019s funding, its treatment under state case law and statutes, and its\nautonomy from state control have not changed in the half-century since the Gordenstein decision\nissued. (D.I. 12; D.L. 13; D.I. 14); see Maliandi v. Montclair State Univ., 845 F.3d 77, 83 (3d\nCir. 2016). The parties did not engage in any meaningful analysis of more recent Third Circuit\nprecedent discussing \u201cthe near unanimity among the Courts of Appeals that the factors relevant\nto an Eleventh Amendment inquiry typically favor immunity in the state college setting,\u201d but the\nparties\u2019 agreement renders such an analysis by the court in this particular case moot. Maliandi,\n845 F.3d at 85.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff Raushan Rich (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) was a University police officer who was hired on\nJune 18, 2012, and was promoted to Sergeant on July 1, 2020. (D.I. 1 at {f 12-13) Plaintiff had\nno disciplinary issues during his employment with the University prior to August 30, 2020. (d.\nat { 40)\n\nTo prepare for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic prior to the start of the fall semester in\nAugust 2020, the University established separate quarantine residence halls (the \u201cResidence\nHalls\u201d) for students who tested positive or were suspected of having the COVID-19 virus. (/d. at\n\u00a7{ 15-17) As part of those preparations, the University planned to have its transportation\nservices transport students to and from the Residence Halls. However, transportation services\ncould not provide transport to students until several days after the beginning of the semester\nbecause safety training did not occur until September 1, 2020. (/d. at 18) In the interim, the\nUniversity required members of its Police Department to transport students to and from the\nResidence Halls from August 29 until September 1. (/d. at ] 19)\n\nMembers of the Police Department did not receive training on how to safely transport\nstudents, how to operate the transport vans, how to use the decontamination machine, or how to\nproperly use the personal protective equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d) provided to them. (/d. at ff 19-22) This\ncaused Plaintiff some concern, and he shared his misgivings with Lieutenant Adrienne Thomas.\n(Id. at ]23) Lieutenant Thomas instructed Plaintiff not to brief his squad on the transports and to\ncall her immediately if he received a transport call. (/d. at [J 24-26) On August 30, 2020,\nLieutenant Thomas advised Plaintiff that she raised his concerns with Major Evans, who\nresponded that the Police Department was required to conduct transports of students to and from\n\nthe Residence Halls until September 1, 2020, regardless of the risk. (Jd. at { 27)\nThat same evening, Plaintiff received a dispatch call to transport a student to the\nResidence Hall. (id. at ]29) Plaintiff informed his squad that he was concerned about the risk\nof exposure to the virus and the lack of training on how to conduct such a transport, and the\nmembers of Plaintiff's squad each indicated they were also unwilling to conduct the transport.\n(Id. at Jf 29-30) Plaintiff contacted Lieutenant Thomas to report the alleged health and safety\nviolations associated with the requested transport. Lieutenant Thomas advised Plaintiff to\nchoose a member of his squad to conduct the transport, and when he declined to do so, she\nselected Corporal Leland Barker to conduct the transport. (/d. at J 31-32)\n\nPlaintiff provided Corporal Barker with the motor pool keys and offered to assist him\nwith his PPE equipment. (/d. at {33) After completing the transport, Corporal Barker told\nPlaintiff that the plastic barriers in the transport vans had gaps in them. (/d.)\n\nLater that evening, Lieutenant Thomas placed Plaintiff on emergency administrative\nleave. (Id. at | 34) The following day, Captain Jason Pires and Lieutenant Ferrill informed\nPlaintiff that he was the subject of an internal affairs investigation and had been charged with\ninsubordination. (/d. at 35) On October 20, 2020, the University released a personnel order\nprematurely stating Plaintiff was terminated pending a Criminal Justice Council (\u201cCJC\u201d) hearing.\n(Id. at J] 36-37, 43-44) Plaintiff continued to receive his full salary and benefits following his\nreceipt of the personnel order. (/d. at 1 37)\n\nOn December 4, 2020, the charge of insubordination against Plaintiff was substantiated,\nand Plaintiff was officially terminated in accordance with the University\u2019s disciplinary matrix,\nwhich permits discipline between forty hours of suspension and termination for a first act of\nsubordination. (Jd. at \u00a7\u00a7 38-41) No Caucasian employees were disciplined or terminated for the\n\nsame violations. (Id. at ff 41-42)\nPlaintiff initiated this civil action against Defendants on January 6, 2022 to seek relief for\nthis chain of events, alleging causes of action for violations of the Delaware Whistleblowers\u2019\nProtection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d), 19 Del. C. \u00a7 1702 (Count I); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000\u00a2 et al. (Count IT); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Count III); and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (Count\nIV). (DL. 1) After waiving service, Defendants responded to the complaint with the instant\nmotion to dismiss filed on May 31, 2022. (D.I. 5) Thereafter, Plaintiff agreed to dismiss Count\nIV of the complaint for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. (D.I. 8 at 13 n.11) Plaintiff also seeks\nleave to amend depending on the court\u2019s recommendation as to some or all counts. (D.I. 8 at 7\nn.4, 15, 16)\n\nIl LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,\n790-91 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Igbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n\nalleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jgbal, 556 U.S. at\n663-64.\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Count I - Delaware Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act\n\nThe WPA protects employees who are fired for reporting violations of certain state and\nfederal laws. Pratt v. M&T Bank Corp., 230 F. Supp. 3d 343, 346 (D. Del. 2017) (citing Smith v.\nDel. State Univ., 47 A.3d 472, 476 (Del. 2012)). Section 1703 of the WPA provides that \u201c[a]n\nemployer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee. . .\n[b]ecause the employee . . . reports or is about to report . . . verbally or in writing, a violation\nwhich the employee knows or reasonably believes has occurred or is about to occur[.]\u201d 19 Del.\nC. \u00a7 1703(1). The statute defines a \u201cviolation\u201d narrowly as an act or omission by the employer\nthat is\n\n[mlJaterially inconsistent with, and a serious deviation from, standards\n\nimplemented pursuant to a law, rule, or regulation promulgated under the laws of\n\nthis State, a political subdivision of this State, or the United States, to protect\n\nemployees or other persons from health, safety, or environmental hazards while\non the employer\u2019s premises or elsewhere[.]\n19 Del. C. \u00a7 1702(6)(a). Thus, to state a claim under the WPA, Plaintiff must allege that: \u201c(1)\n[he] engaged in a protected whistleblowing activity; (2) the accused official knew of the\nprotected activity; (3) [Plaintiff] suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) there is a causal\nconnection between the whistleblowing activity and the adverse action.\u201d Doe v. New Castle\nCounty, C.A. No. 21-1450-RGA, 2022 WL 1909394, at *6 (D. Del. Jun. 3, 2022) (quoting\nChance v. Kraft Heinz Foods Co., 2018 WL 6655670, at *10 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 17, 2018)).\n\nDefendants argue that the complaint fails to satisfy the first and fourth elements. (D.I. 6\nat 5-9) For the following reasons, I recommend that the court deny Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss Count I of Plaintiff's complaint.\n\n1. Allegations of \u201cprotected activity\u201d\n\nTo meet the first element of a WPA claim at this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiff must\nallege that he reported conduct which he reasonably believed to be a violation of the law. See\nKelsall v. BayHealth, Inc., 2015 WL 9312477, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 18, 2015). Here, the\ncomplaint alleges that the officers were not trained on how to operate the transport vans, how to\nuse the decontamination machine, or how to properly use personal protective equipment\n(\u201cPPE\u201d). (D.I. 1 at J] 20-23) The complaint further alleges that Plaintiff informed Lieutenant\nThomas of his concerns about the health and safety risks to officers resulting from transporting\nstudents without proper training. (/d. at ]23) The pleading specifies that the alleged health and\nsafety violations include violations of OSHA standards, CDC regulations and guidelines, and the\nsafety and health provision at Article XII of Plaintiff's collective bargaining agreement. (/d. at J\n47) These allegations, taken as true, are sufficient to establish a \u201cprotected activity\u201d at this early\n\nstage of the proceedings. See Jones v. Navient, 2022 WL 2063308, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. May\n25, 2022) (finding allegations that plaintiff reported grievances of unfair treatment and\nharassment to management were sufficient to state a claim under the WPA).\n\nDefendants argue that the complaint does not plausibly allege a violation of any law, rule,\nor regulation because Plaintiff fails to cite to a specific provision of the OSHA standards, CDC\nregulations and guidelines, and/or the safety and health provision at Article XII of Plaintiff's\ncollective bargaining agreement that were allegedly violated. (D.I. 6 at 5-7) But at this stage of\nthe proceedings, it is sufficient to plead reported conduct that the plaintiff \u201creasonably believed\nto be a violation of law, even if he did not plead facts showing which law he believed [the\ndefendant\u2019s] misconduct violated.\u201d Jones, 2022 WL 2063308, at *2. There is no requirement\nthat Plaintiff must identify in the complaint the specific provisions which were allegedly\nviolated. See Chance v. Kraft Heinz Foods Co., 2018 WL 6655670, at *11 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec.\n17, 2018) (acknowledging that the plaintiff may state a claim despite being uncertain of the\nspecific law, or even that there is a law, when reporting the conduct). The cases cited by\nDefendants require more specificity only at the dispositive motion stage. See, e.g., Hanzer v.\nNat\u2019l Mentor Healthcare, LLC, C.A. No. 12-363-LPS-MPT, 2014 WL 1390889, at *6 (D. Del.\nApr. 10, 2014) (granting summary judgment due to the plaintiff's failure to identify any statute,\ntule, or regulation establishing a violation under the WPA); Johnson v. Res. For Human Dev.,\nInc., 789 F. Supp. 2d 595, 601 (E.D. Pa. 2011).\n\nDefendants also cite the absence of pleaded allegations confirming that Plaintiff relayed\nthe alleged violations or the purported illegality of the University\u2019s directive to Lieutenant\nThomas. (D.I. 10 at 1-2) But the complaint expressly states that \u201cPlaintiff contacted Lieutenant\nAdrienne Thomas to report his concern over using the Police Department to transport COVID\n\npositive students without proper training. He stated it created an unnecessary exposure and\nhealth and safety risk to officers for non-law enforcement purposes.\u201d (D.I. 1 at \u00a7 23) This is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the pleading standard, and there is no requirement for Plaintiff to cite the\n\nspecific law or regulation alleged to have been violated. See Jones, 2022 WL 2063308, at *2.\n2. University\u2019s awareness of alleged safety concerns\n\nDefendants allege that Plaintiff's WPA claim fails as a matter of law due to the\ncomplaint\u2019s acknowledgement that the violations cited by Plaintiff were already known to the\nUniversity. (D.I. 6 at 7) According to Defendants, the purpose of the WPA is not served when\nan employee reports information already known to the employer. (D.I. 10 at 4)\n\nPlaintiff does not refute Defendants\u2019 argument that the University was aware of the\nalleged violations before Plaintiff provided notice of those violations. Instead, Plaintiff focuses\non the University\u2019s knowledge of Plaintiff's reports, which is a required element to state a claim\nunder the WPA. (D.I. 8 at 10) Plaintiff also argues that the nonbinding cases cited by\nDefendants are distinguishable because they did not involve application of Delaware\u2019s WPA,\nand the employers in those cases took corrective action to fix the known violations. (/d. at 11)\n\nViewing the pleaded allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the court finds\nthat the University\u2019s prior awareness of the alleged safety violations does not negate the\nwhistleblowing effect of Plaintiff's report. The complaint states that \u201cDefendant was previously\naware of the health and safety hazards and violations relating to the COVID transports, however,\nDefendant failed to take corrective or protective action.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 948) Thus, the complaint\nspecifies that the University took no corrective action based on its prior knowledge. Cf\nPedersen v. Bio-Med. Applications of Minn., 992 F. Supp. 2d 934, 939 (D. Minn. 2014), aff'd,\n775 F.3d 1049 (8th Cir. 2015) (finding that plaintiff's complaints did not constitute\n\nwhistleblower \u201creports\u201d where the defendant was already aware of the issue and had taken steps\nto correct it). Consequently, the University\u2019s prior awareness of the alleged safety violations\ndoes not provide a sufficient basis to dismiss Count I of the complaint at this stage.\n\nPlaintiff correctly notes that the cases cited by Defendants are from outside this district\nand did not invoke Delaware\u2019s WPA, and Defendants acknowledge that they were unable to find\na Delaware case supporting their position. (D.I. 8 at 11; D.I. 10 at 5 n.6) Defendants\u2019 authority\nis also of limited persuasive value because the facts of those cases are not on all fours with the\nallegations presently before the court. Each of the cases cited by Defendants involved\ncircumstances where the employer already knew of the violation and was also taking corrective\naction. See Pedersen, 992 F. Supp. 2d at 939; U.S. ex. rel. Hartman v. Allegheny Gen. Hosp.,\n2005 WL 2106627, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 26, 2005) (finding no protected whistleblower activity\nwhere employer was already aware of billing problem and had taken steps to address it); Pelant\nv. Pinnacle Airlines, Inc., 2006 WL 2286381, at *6-7 (D. Minn. Aug. 8, 2006) (finding no\nwhistleblowing where the employer knew of the industry-wide problem and expressed its own\nconcerns about the issue); Moss v. Kentucky State Univ., 465 S.W.3d 457, 460 (Ky. Ct. App.\n2014) (finding no cause of action under the Whistleblower Act where the defendant was aware\nof accounting problems and was attempting to address them). Here, the complaint specifies that\nthe University did not take corrective action despite its knowledge of the alleged safety\nviolations. (D.I. 1 at 48) As a result, it is plausible that Plaintiffs report could expose safety\nviolations for the benefit of the public in the face of the University\u2019s prior inaction.\n\n3. Inference of termination due to complaints about safety concerns\n\nDefendants argue that the complaint also fails to satisfy the fourth element of a WPA\nclaim because it alleges the mere fact of a report followed by termination, instead of showing\n\nthat Plaintiff was terminated because of his report. (D.I. 6 at 8) According to Defendants,\ntemporal proximity between the report and the termination is not enough, by itself, to establish\ncausation. (D.I. 10 at 6-7)\n\nPlaintiff responds that the complaint\u2019s allegations are sufficient to give rise to an\ninference that the protected whistleblowing activity was the \u201cprimary basis\u201d for Plaintiff's\ntermination. (D.I. 8 at 12) Plaintiff rejects Defendants\u2019 position that the complaint\u2019s allegations\non causation are based solely on temporal proximity. (/d. at 12-13) Nonetheless, Plaintiff does\nnot identify any other pleaded basis for causation.\n\nAt this stage, Plaintiff adequately pleads a causal connection between his alleged\nprotected activity and his subsequent termination. See Jones, 2022 WL 2063308, at *3. The\ncourt can infer that Plaintiff's protected whistleblowing activity was the \u201cprimary basis\u201d for his\ntermination based on the complaint\u2019s allegations of temporal proximity. See Thomas v. Del.\nState Univ., C.A. No. 10-522-GMS, 2014 WL 5020275, at *7 (D. Del. Oct. 6, 2014) (explaining\nthat \u201ctiming is a critical factor in assessing causation\u201d under Delaware\u2019s WPA). The complaint\nalleges that Plaintiff made his report on the evening of August 30, 2020, he was placed on\nemergency administrative leave later that same evening, and he was charged with\ninsubordination the following day. (D.I. 1 at J] 29-31, 34-35, 50) Viewing these allegations in\nthe light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is reasonable to infer that Plaintiff's report of the alleged\nsafety violations was the primary basis for the adverse employment actions against him.\n\nDefendants argue that temporal proximity alone is insufficient to establish causation for\npurposes of stating a claim under Delaware\u2019s WPA. (D.L. 6 at 8-9; D.I. 10 at 6-7) But none of\nthe cases cited by Defendants in support of this argument addressed causation under Delaware\u2019s\nWPA. At least one case from within this district suggests that temporal proximity is a \u201ccritical\n\nfactor in assessing causation\u201d under Delaware\u2019s WPA. Thomas, 2014 WL 5020275, at *7.\n\n10\nConsequently, I recommend that the court deny Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count I of the\ncomplaint at this early stage of the proceedings.\n\nB. Counts II and III - Title VII and Section 1983 Claims Against the University\n\nCounts II and III of the complaint plead causes of action against the University for racial\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n2000\u00a2e et al., and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, respectively. (D.I. 1 at {] 55-76) Defendants argue that\nPlaintiffs Title VII and \u00a7 1983 claims against the University should be dismissed because\nPlaintiff has failed to show he suffered an adverse employment action due to his race, and the\ncomplaint sets forth only conclusory allegations. (D.I. 6 at 10) Plaintiff responds that the\npleaded allegations are sufficient to state a claim at this early stage of the proceedings. (D.I. 8 at\n14-15)\n\nTitle VII prohibits employment practices that \u201ccause[ ] a disparate impact on the basis of\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k). To state a claim for\nemployment discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must allege that: \u201c(1) he is a member of a\nprotected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he held; (3) he suffered an adverse\nemployment action; and (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances that\ngive rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d Peterson v. Shulkin, C.A. No. 16-160-LPS, 2018\nWL 1316200, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 14, 2018) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\nU.S. 792, 802 (1973)). To plead a cause of action for denial of equal protection under \u00a7 1983, a\nplaintiff must plausibly allege that a person acting under color of state law subjected the plaintiff\nto different treatment than other similarly situated individuals. See Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch.\nDist., 767 F.3d 247, 273 (3d Cir. 2014). At the pleading stage, \u201c[a] plaintiff need not convince\n\nthe court of any of these elements . . . but must submit more than naked assertion that he suffered\n\n11\nan adverse employment action because of his membership in a protected class.\u201d Blades v.\nMosaic of Del., C.A. No. 16-627-GMS, 2017 WL 3868238, at *6 (D. Del. Aug. 31, 2017) (citing\nSantos v. Iron Mountain Film & Sounds, 593 F. App\u2019x 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2014)).\n\nThe pleaded allegations in this case fall into the latter category of naked assertions, which\nare insufficient to state a claim for discrimination. See Holmes v. Gates, 403 F. App\u2019x 670, 673\n(3d Cir. 2010) (explaining that the Rule 8 pleading standard requires more than \u201c[t]hreadbare\nrecitals of a cause of action\u2019s elements, supported by mere conclusory statements[.]\u201d). The\ncomplaint alleges that Plaintiff was terminated \u201cfor alleged violations for which other Caucasian\nemployees were not terminated or even disciplined for,\u201d and the University \u201chas engaged in a\npattern and practice of disproportionately treating and disciplining its African American officers,\nwhile failing to discipline its Caucasian officers.\u201d (D.I. 1 at { 41-42) The complaint further\nalleges that the University prematurely issued a personnel termination order for Plaintiff, and no\nsimilar personnel orders were issued for Caucasian employees. (/d. at | 44) Plaintiff confirms\nthat these allegations constitute the totality of the facts pled in support of his race discrimination\nclaims. (D.L. 8 at 14)\n\nThese allegations do not plausibly suggest that Plaintiff was treated differently than other\nemployees because of his race. The complaint provides no details to support Plaintiff's position\nthat violations committed by Caucasian officers were similar to Plaintiff's infractions, nor does it\nprovide factual context regarding how the dispensation of discipline differed between Caucasian\nofficers and African American officers. See Holmes, 403 F. App\u2019x at 673 (finding employee\u2019s\nallegations of different treatment than that experienced by non-minority employees lacked the\nrequisite specificity to state a claim for Title VII discrimination); Jester v. State of Del. Dep\u2019t of\n\nSafety, C.A. No. 14-1124-LPS, 2015 WL 5724366, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2015) (dismissing\n\n12\nTitle VII claim where complaint \u201cdoes not provide a single fact, example, or detail to support\nthese conclusory allegations.\u201d). Consequently, I recommend dismissal of Counts II and III of the\ncomplaint against the University.\n\nC. Count II - Section 1983 Claim Against Ogden in His Individual Capacity?\n\nCount III also pleads a cause of action against Ogden in his individual capacity under \u00a7\n1983. (DL 1 at ff 68-76) Both parties agree that Plaintiff's cause of action against Ogden\nindividually under \u00a7 1983 requires a showing of Ogden\u2019s personal involvement in the alleged\nviolation. (D.I. 6 at 14; D.L. 8 at 15-16); see also Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d\nCir. 1988); Tait v. New Castle Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, C.A. No. 19-348-MN, 2019 WL 5788487, at *2\n(D. Del. Nov. 5, 2019) (\u201cLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature and, to be\nliable, a defendant must have been personally involved in the wrongful conduct.\u201d). The parties\ndisagree about whether Plaintiffs pleaded allegations adequately show Ogden\u2019s personal\ninvolvement. (Jd.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Ogden was personally involved in the discrimination based on the\nfollowing allegations in the complaint: (1) Ogden \u201cterminated Plaintiff for alleged violations for\nwhich other Caucasian employees were not terminated or even disciplined for,\u201d (D.I. 1 at | 41);\n(2) Ogden \u201cengaged in a pattern and practice of disproportionately treating and disciplining [ ]\nAfrican American officers, while failing to discipline [ ] Caucasian officers,\u201d (id. at ] 69); and\n(3) Ogden knew of the discriminatory conduct, but he acted with deliberate indifference and\nfailed to report or investigate the alleged discrimination, (id. at ] 74). These allegations associate\nOgden\u2019s name with Plaintiffs termination and the discriminatory conduct, but for the reasons\n2 Count ITI of the complaint alleges a cause of action against Defendant Ogden in both his\nofficial capacity and his individual capacity pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 1 at {{ 68-76)\n\nIn his answering brief, Plaintiff agrees to dismiss his \u00a7 1983 claim against Defendant Ogden in\nhis official capacity. (D.I. 8 at 15)\n\n13\npreviously discussed at \u00a7 IJJ.B, supra, they lack any factual context that might otherwise render\nthem plausible. See Victorious v. Lanigan, 2016 WL 2981759, at *8 (D.N.J. May 23, 2016)\n(finding conclusory allegations were insufficient, standing alone, to establish the individual\ndefendants\u2019 personal involvement in the alleged violations); Meyer v. Hyatt, 2016 WL 1079148,\nat *2 (D.N.J. Mar. 18, 2016) (dismissing individual \u00a7 1983 claim that failed to allege sufficiently\nspecific facts showing that the individual defendants \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to plaintiff's abuse).\n\nThe complaint does not plausibly establish that Ogden\u2019s termination of Plaintiff was the\nresult of racial animus, nor does it include sufficient details to show that Ogden\u2019s alleged\nconduct was the result of racial discrimination. See Gillette v. Prosper, 852 F. App\u2019x 642, 645\n(3d Cir. 2021) (upholding dismissal of individual \u00a7 1983 claim where amended complaint\ncontained general, conclusory statements that individual defendants were deliberately indifferent\nto the plaintiff's treatment). Consequently, I recommend that the court dismiss Count III of the\ncomplaint against Ogden in his individual capacity.\n\nD. Count IV - Section 1981 Claim\n\nPlaintiff has agreed to dismiss Count IV of the complaint for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1981. (D.I. 8 at 13 n.11) Consequently, I recommend that the court dismiss Count IV.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss without prejudice. (D.I. 5) Specifically, | recommend that the court GRANT\nthe motion to dismiss Counts II to IV of the complaint, DENY the motion to dismiss Count I of\nthe complaint, and GRANT Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.\n\nPlaintiff may amend the complaint within 10 days of the expiration of the deadline for\n\nobjections under Rule 72(b), or in accordance with a ruling from the court on objections, if any.\n\n14\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: February 2, 2023\n\nAGISTRATE JUDGE\n\n15\n"}
