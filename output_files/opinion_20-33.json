Hartmann\u2019s\n\nWilliam\n\nPetitions for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and\nMemoranda in Support. (D-I. 3, 8, 10, 23, 25, 26, 29-31, 39, 45, 47, 51, 52, 54, 56,\n65, 93) The State filed an Answer in opposition. (D.I. 103) For the reasons\ndiscussed, the Court will deny Petitioner\u2019s habeas requests.\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nA. The Crime\n\nIn late 1999, Delaware State Police were investigating a report that a minor\ngirl had been sexually abused by her two brothers. (D.I. 103 at 9) When the girl\u2019s\nthirteen-year-old brother was asked where he had learned this behavior, he\nrevealed that he had learned the acts during the previous summer spent with\nPetitioner. (/d.; D.I. 104-22 at 6) The victim had been introduced to Petitioner\nwhile at church, and, with the father\u2019s permission, the brother agreed to do odd\njobs for Petitioner in the summer of 1998 to earn some extra money. The brother\nreported that the first incident took place at Killen\u2019s Pond State Park where the\nbrother and Petitioner were jogging. Petitioner suggested that they take a break,\nand Petitioner began touching the brother in a sexual manner and began to\nmasturbate the brother. The second, third, and fourth incidents took place in a\n\nbathroom at Petitioner\u2019s home, with Petitioner and the brother masturbating each\nother and performing other sexual acts, including intercourse. (D.I. 104-22 at 6-7)\nThe fifth incident occurred in Petitioner\u2019s living room, where the victim was seated\non the couch while Petitioner performed sexual acts on him. Petitioner filmed\nthese sexual acts. (D.I. 104-22 at 7) At the time of the offenses, Petitioner was 45\nyears old and married with two young children. (D.I. 104-23 at 2) When the State\nPolice searched Petitioner\u2019s computer, they located thousands of pornographic\nphotos, including 150 pictures of suspected homosexual male child pornography.\n(D.I. 104-23 at 8)\n\nB. Procedural History\n\nPetitioner was arrested in December 1999 and subsequently indicted on\neight counts of second degree unlawful sexual contact, six counts of first degree\nunlawful sexual intercourse, five counts each of dealing in child pornography and\npossession of child pornography, and one count each of unlawful sexual\nexploitation of a child and sexual solicitation of a child. (D.I. 104-1 at 2; D.I. 103\nat 2). In March 2001, Petitioner pled guilty in the Delaware Superior Court to one\ncount of second degree unlawful sexual intercourse (a lesser included offense of\nfirst degree unlawful sexual intercourse) and two counts of unlawful sexual\ncontact. See Hartmann v. State, 818 A.2d 970 (Table), 2003 WL 1524623, at *1\n(Del. Mar. 20, 2003). Petitioner was immediately sentenced to an aggregate of\n\nnineteen years of incarceration, suspended after ten mandatory years for decreasing\n2\nlevels of supervision. See Hartmann vy. State, 19 A.3d 301 (Table), 2011 WL\n1486567, at *1 (Del. Apr.19, 2011). Petitioner was designated a Tier III sex\noffender and was ordered to have no contact with minors, except for his biological\nchildren. Petitioner did not file a direct appeal from his sentence. See id.\n\nIn August 2003, Petitioner filed his first petition for habeas corpus relief\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. See Hartmann v. Carroll, 2004 WL 27 13104, at *1\n(D. Del. Nov. 16, 2004). The Honorable Joseph J. Farnan denied the petition as\ntime-barred. See id. at *5. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that\ndecision. See Hartmann v. Carroll, 492 F.3d 478, 479 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\nIn February 2009, while Petitioner was serving probation, the State moved to\nmodify the no contact provision of Petitioner\u2019s sentence to forbid him from\ncontacting any minor child, including any biological child who had been adopted\nafter the termination of his parental rights. See Hartmann, 2011 WL 1486567, at\n*1, The Superior Court granted the motion. Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court dismissed the appeal as untimely. See id.\n\nPetitioner then filed a series of motions, including a Rule 61 motion for\npostconviction relief, which were all denied on December 22, 2010. (D.I. 104-1 at\n18) In April 2011, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s\ndecision, explaining that: (1) to the extent Petitioner was challenging his 2001\n\nconvictions, the Rule 61 motion was untimely; (2) to the extent he was challenging\n3\nthe termination of his parental rights, the Family Court had exclusive jurisdiction\nand the issue was not within the Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review; (3) to the\nextent he was challenging the Superior Court\u2019s 2009 modification of the condition\nof his probation prohibiting his contact with any of his biological children for\nwhom his parental rights had been terminated, the argument was meritless; (4) the\nSuperior Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to\nappoint counsel because there is no constitutional or statutory right to counsel in a\ncriminal collateral proceeding; and (5) the Superior Court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in restricting Petitioner\u2019s access to the internet while on probation since\nhe had been charged with possession of child pornography. See Hartmann, 2011\nWL 1486567, at *1-2.\n\nIn May 2011, Petitioner was arrested on an administrative warrant for a\nviolation of probation (\u201c\u201cVOP\u201d) based on a search of Petitioner\u2019s residence in\nwhich was found two deadly weapons and a laptop computer with Wi-Fi\ncapability. See Hartmann v. State, 61 A.3d 618 (Table), 2013 WL 434052, at *2\n(Del. Feb. 4, 2013). While not part of the administrative warrant, a subsequent\nsearch of the laptop revealed thousands of pornographic images, the majority of\nwhich were age indeterminate. (D.I. 104-20 at 70-71) Ata hearing in April 2012,\nthe Superior Court found that Petitioner had committed a VOP and sentenced him\n\naccordingly to four years of Level V imprisonment, to be followed by probation.\n4\nSee Hartmann, 2013 WL 434052, at *1. Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s VOP determination. See id. at *1-2.\nIn April 2012, Petitioner filed his second \u00a7 2254 petition in this Court,\narguing that the Delaware Family Court improperly terminated his parental rights\nand that the Superior Court\u2019s 2009 modification of the no-contact provision\nviolated his rights to procedural due process and equal protection of the laws. See\nHartmann v. Johnson, 2013 WL 969807, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 11, 2013). The\nHonorable Sue L. Robinson denied the petition in March 2013 because the claims\nwere not cognizable on federal habeas review. See id.\n\nIn December 2014, the Superior Court modified Petitioner\u2019s VOP sentence\n\u201cto reflect there is no suspension of the [L]evel 5 time until the defendant\nsuccessfully completes the Sexual Adjustment Programs.\u201d (D.I. 104-1 at Entry\nNo. 259; D.I. 104-20 at 52). In March 2015, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court\na pro se motion for review of his sentence. In April 2015, the Superior Court\ndenied the motion as untimely under Superior Court Criminal Rule 35 (\u201cRule 35\u201d)\nbecause it was filed more than 90 days after the imposition of Petitioner\u2019s\nsentence. (D.I. 104-1 at Entry No. 261)\n\nIn August 2019, an administrative warrant and VOP report were docketed in\nthe Superior Court, alleging that petitioner had violated his probation by having\n\nsexual contact with a minor. (D.I. 104-1 at Entry Nos. 264, 265); see Hartmann v.\n5\nState, 223 A.3d 883 (Table), 2019 WL 6813986, at *1 (Del. Dec. 12, 2019). After\na hearing in September 2019, the Superior Court found that Petitioner had\ncommitted a VOP, and sentenced him as follows: (1) on one count of his unlawful\nsexual contact, Petitioner was sentenced to two years of Level V Transitions Sex\nOffender Program; and (2) on the other count of his unlawful sexual contact,\nPetitioner was sentenced to two years of Level V imprisonment, suspended after\none year and successful completion of the Transitions Program, for two years of\nprobation. See id. On appeal, Petitioner argued that: (1) his 2001 convictions\nshould be invalidated; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the VOP\nfinding; (3) the State violated its duty to represent Petitioner and the public at the\nVOP hearing; and (4) counsel provided ineffective assistance during the VOP\nhearing. Jd. at *2. In affirming the Superior Court\u2019s decision, the Delaware\nSupreme Court declined to consider Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims relating to his 2019 VOP for the first time on direct appeal. The Delaware\nSupreme Court also found that Petitioner\u2019s challenges to his 2001 convictions\nbased on allegedly being a member of a protected class and his related ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims were not \u201cjusticiable in this appeal\u201d because Petitioner\n\u201cneeded to do that in a direct appeal or a [Rule 61] motion for postconviction\nrelief.\u201d Id. at *2. The Delaware Supreme Court denied Petitioner\u2019s insufficient\n\nevidence claims as unsupported, noting that Petitioner\u2019s own admissions did not\n6\nconstitute hearsay and the State did not have to file new criminal charges to\nprosecute him on the VOP. Id. The Delaware Supreme Court also found that the\nState had not violated any duty to Petitioner or the public in the VOP proceedings.\nId.\n\nIn January 2020, Petitioner commenced this proceeding by filing a pro se\npleading styled as a petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus under\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. (D.I.3) After the issuance of a deficiency notice, Petitioner\nfiled a corrected Petition on July 23, 2020. (DL. 8) Petitioner has subsequently\nfiled numerous exhibits, amendments, and supplements to his Petition. (See D.I.\n23, 25, 26, 29-31, 39, 47, 52, 54, 56, 65, 93) Petitioner has also requested\nmandamus relief or preliminary injunctions based on administrative or healthcare\nprocedures or conditions related to his confinement. (See D.I. 11, 13, 28, 29, 43,\n46,51) On September 16, 2021, this Court concluded that such requests were not\nproperly brought in Petitioner\u2019s instant habeas proceeding, but rather, they must be\nbrought in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 79-18 at 1) The Court also\nruled that \u201cany future filings raising prison condition issues and/or medical issues\nwill not be filed in this proceeding but will be viewed as initiating a new case\n\nopening.\u201d Jd. at 4.\nII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal\nsentences . . . and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal\ncourt may consider a habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \u201con the ground\nthat he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the\nUnited States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Additionally, AEDPA imposes procedural\nrequirements and standards for analyzing the merits of a habeas petition in order to\n\u201cprevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state-court convictions are\ngiven effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 693\n(2002).\n\nB. Second or Successive Habeas Petitions\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), a petitioner must seek authorization\nfrom the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive habeas\npetition in a district court. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007); Rule\n9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. Notably, a petition for habeas relief is not considered to\nbe \u201csecond or successive simply because it follows an earlier federal petition.\u201d\n\nBenchoff v. Colleran, 404 F.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 2005). Rather, a habeas petition\n8\nis classified as second or successive within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 ifa\nprior petition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new petitions challenge\nthe same conviction, and the new petition asserts a claim that was, or could have\nbeen, raised in a prior habeas petition. See Benchoff, 404 F.3d at 817; In re\nOlabode, 325 F.3d 166, 169-73 (3d Cir. 2003). If a habeas petitioner erroneously\nfiles a second or successive habeas petition \u201cin a district court without the\npermission of a court of appeals, the district court\u2019s only option is to dismiss the\npetition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\u201d\nRobinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002). The Supreme Court has\nheld that \u201cthe phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 must be interpreted with respect to the\njudgment challenged.\u201d Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 333 (2010).\nC. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999);\nPicard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\ncourt shall not be granted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in\nthe courts of the State; or\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\n\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such\n\nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of\ncomity, gives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues\nby invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review\nprocess.\u201d O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192\n(3d Cir. 2000).\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the\ncourt to consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451\nn.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised\nthe issue on direct appeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted\nand the petitioner does not need to raise the same issue again in a state post-\nconviction proceeding. See Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir.\n1997).\n\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and\nfurther state court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the\nfederal court will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted.\n\nSee Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[]\n10\nthe technical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer\navailable); see also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims,\nhowever, are procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 US. at 749; Lines v.\nLarkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a\nhabeas claim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d\nrefuses to review the merits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state\nprocedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman,\n501 USS. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will\nresult if the court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172\nF.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause\nfor a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor\nexternal to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate\nactual prejudice, a petitioner must show that the errors during his trial created more\nthan a possibility of prejudice; he must show that the errors worked to his actual\nand substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional\n\ndimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n11\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d? then a federal\ncourt can excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of\njustice exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means\nfactual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n614, 623 (1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual\ninnocence by asserting \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory\nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical\nevidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d showing that no reasonable juror would\nhave voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Hubbard v.\nPinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nD. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted\nif the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\n2Murray, 477 US. at 496.\n| 12\nof the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn,\n250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d\nfor the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision finally resolved the claim\non the basis of its substance, rather than on a procedural or some other ground. See\nThomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7\n2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by an opinion\nexplaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86,\n98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit may be presumed that the state\ncourt adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-\nlaw procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d Id. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that\nthe state court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\nThis presumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of\nfact, and is only rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7\n2254(e)(1); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard\nin \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application\n\nstandard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).\n13\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Court liberally construes Petitioner\u2019s voluminous pleadings as raising\nthe following categories of claims:? (1) claims related to his 2001 convictions; (2)\nclaims related to his 2012 VOP; (3) claims concerning his 2019 VOP; (4) claims\nthat are not cognizable on federal habeas review because they assert errors of\nDelaware state law, concern the conditions of his confinement, or do not provide a\nright to pursue; and (5) claims that are too vague, conclusory, or unintelligible.\n\nA. Claims One to Eleven: Challenges to 2001 Convictions\n\nPetitioner asserts the following eleven arguments challenging his March\n2001 convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse and sexual contact: (1) the\nDelaware Division of Family Services (\u201cDFS\u201d), and not Superior Court, had\npersonal and subject matter jurisdiction over his matter (D.I. 8 at 26 -29; D.I. 56 at\n2); (2) Petitioner is a member of a legally protected class and immune from\ncriminal prosecution (D.I. 8 at 26; D.I. 8-1 at 4 to 5); (3) the State fraudulently\nbrought the original criminal charges against Petitioner and maliciously prosecuted\nhim (D.I. 8 at 26; D.I. 8-1 at 4); (4) Petitioner\u2019s private health information was\nimproperly entered into the public record as part of his sentencing (D.I. 8-2 at 17);\n(5) Petitioner has involuntarily signed various forms and papers despite being\n\ndisabled and legally incompetent since the time of his arrest in 1999 (D.I. 8-3 at\n\n3For ease of analysis, the Court has re-numbered the Claims sequentially.\n14\n29); (6) Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was coerced (D.I. 30); (7) the State allegedly had\ninsufficient evidence to convict Petitioner (D.I. 8-4 at 17); (8) the judges in the\nDelaware courts committed misconduct by abusing their discretion, having\nconflicts of interest, and violating judicial canons (D.I. 8-5 at 8-16); (9) requiring\nPetitioner to register as a sex offender under Delaware\u2019s sex offender registration\nstatute, 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4121 (\u201c\u2018SORNA\u201d), is unconstitutional and amounts to cruel\nand unusual punishment, false imprisonment, and places arbitrary and capricious\nrestrictions on him (D.I. 8-4 at 25-30; D.I. 8-5 at 1-5); (10) the \u201clegal elements and\nsentencing guidelines\u201d for unlawful sexual conduct are, among other deficiencies,\nunequal, wrongfully subjective, biased, prejudicial, and discriminatory (D.L. 8-4 at\n14); and (11) the Delaware state courts violated Petitioner\u2019s rights under the First,\nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution (D.I. 56).*\n\nOnce again, the Court notes that the instant Petition contains arguments\nchallenging several judgments, namely, Petitioner\u2019s original 2001 convictions and\nhis 2012 and 2019 VOPs. In 2005, the Supreme Court noted that the requirements\nof \u00a7 2244(b)(2) do not apply to a petition as a whole but require inquiry into\n\nspecific claims. See Pace v. Diguglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 416 (2005). In 2010, the\n\n\u2018The Court liberally construes the arguments in D.J. 56 as contesting all the\ncategories of judgments.\n15\nSupreme Court held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 must be interpreted\nwith respect to the judgment challenged.\u201d Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320,\n333 (2010) (stating that where \u201cthere is a new judgment intervening between ...\ntwo habeas petitions, an application challenging the resulting new judgment is not\n\u2018second or successive\u2019 at all.\u201d). The State asserts that the Third Circuit may view\nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d as applying to entire habeas petitions and not to\nindividual claims in those petitions, thereby requiring the dismissal of an entire\npetition as second or successive if it contains any second or successive claims.\n(D.I. 103 at 18) The Court is not persuaded, because it has not found any explicit\nconsistent rule or approach for \u201cmixed\u201d habeas petitions containing some claims\nwhich are second or successive and some claims which are not when, as here, the\nother intervening judgments being challenged are violations of probations and not\nnew sentences imposed as a result of the first habeas proceeding or as a result of an\nappellate remand. See, e.g., Woods v. Ryan, 2019 WL 1560341, at *3 (D. Ariz.\nFeb. 27, 2019) (collecting cases). But see Perez-Garcia v. Woods, 2016 WL\n11662173, *3 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 28, 2016) (concluding that the \u201cinclusion of a claim\nin [petitioner\u2019s] current habeas petition that was previously denied on the merits\nrenders his current petition a second or successive petition for purposes of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b), even if some of the additional claims would not qualify as\n\nsecond or successive claims.\u201d). Since claims relating to Petitioner\u2019s 2012 and\n16\n2019 VOP decisions were not ripe at the conclusion of Petitioner\u2019s first 2003\nhabeas proceeding, they could not have been included in Petitioner\u2019s first petition.*\nConsequently, the Court concludes that it may appropriately determine whether the\nClaims challenging Petitioner\u2019s 2001 convictions are second or successive and, if\nso, dismiss those claims for being second or successive without necessitating a\ndismissal of the entire Petition as second or successive.\n\nClaims One through Eleven challenge the same 2001 convictions that\n\nClaims One through Eleven challenge the same 2001 convictions that Petitioner\n\n5The State raises the possibility that Petitioner may have been able to raise Claims\nTwelve through Twenty in his second habeas petition, perhaps in an effort to\nsuggest the Claims Twelve through Twenty are second or successive. (See D.I.\n103 at 29) The following procedural history demonstrates why Claims Twelve\nthrough Twenty are not second or successive.\n\nOn April 6, 2012, the Superior Court found that Petitioner had violated his\nprobation. On April 10, 2012, Petitioner filed his second habeas petition in this\nCourt, which challenged the 2009 modification of his probation. (See D.I. 1 in\nHartmann v. State, Civ. A. No. 12-436-SLR (D. Del. Apr. 10, 2012)). Given this\nsequence of events, the Court acknowledges that Petitioner technically could have\nraised his challenges to the April 2012 VOP decision in his April 2012 habeas\npetition. Importantly, however, the Delaware Supreme Court did not affirm the\nSuperior Court\u2019s 2012 VOP decision until February 4, 2013, and Petitioner\u2019s\nsecond habeas petition was denied for failing to assert issues cognizable on federal\nhabeas review on March 11, 2013. (See id. at DI. 11) Although Petitioner did not\nseek certiorari review of the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the ninety-day\nperiod for seeking such review must be included when determining the finality of\nhis 2012 VOP decision. Adding ninety days to February 4, 2013 results with\nPetitioner\u2019s 2012 VOP decision becoming final on May 6, 2013, almost two full\nmonths after the dismissal of his second federal habeas petition. Given these\ncircumstances, the Court concludes that Claims Twelve to Twenty are not second\nor successive claims.\n\n17\nchallenged in his 2003 habeas petition, and the arguments either were\u00ae or could\nhave been raised in the 2003 petition. In addition, the dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s\n2003 petition as time-barred constitutes an adjudication on the merits for the\npurposes of \u00a7 2244(b). See Benchoff, 404 F.3d at 817-18; Murray v. Greiner, 394\nF.3d 78, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005). Given these circumstances, the Court concludes\nthat the aforementioned Claims constitute second or second habeas requests.\n\nThe record reveals that Petition did not obtain permission from the Third\nCircuit Court of Appeals before presenting the instant second or successive Claims\nin this proceeding. In addition, since the instant arguments do not come close to\nsatisfying the substantive requirements for a second or successive petition under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the Court concludes that it would not be in the interest of\njustice to transfer these Claims to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss Claims One through Eleven for lack of\njurisdiction because they are unauthorized second or successive habeas requests.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(1); Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir.\n2002) (holding that when a second or successive habeas petition is erroneously\n\nfiled \u201cin a district court without the permission of the court of appeals, the district\n\n$Petitioner raised the argument that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction over his\ncharges (Claim One in this proceeding) in his 2003 petition. See Hartmann, 2004\nWL 2713104, at *1.\n\n18\ncourt\u2019s only option is to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\u201d).\n\nB. Claims Twelve to Twenty: Time-Barred Challenges to 2012 VOP\nJudgment\n\nPetitioner asserts the following eight Claims challenging his 2012 VOP\njudgement: (1) Claim Twelve \u2014 the State obstructed, impeded or denied Petitioner\ncertain rights and interests (e.g., procedural rights, transcript rights, right to copy of\nenvelopes mailed) (D.I. 8-3 at 12,17-18); (2) Claim Thirteen \u2014 the Sate violated\nPetitioner\u2019s procedural and substantive rights by lodging criminal charges against\nPetitioner as part of his VOP proceeding (/d.); (3) Claim Fourteen \u2014 the VOP\nproceedings were \u201ctoo informal and summary for criminal charges/sentences\u201d\n(Id.); (4) Claim Fifteen \u2014 the State maliciously prosecuted Petitioner and did not\nuphold his rights (D.I. 8-3 at 17); (5) Claim Sixteen \u2014 counsel provided ineffective\nassistance of counsel during the 2012 VOP proceeding by failing to effectively\ncross-examine unspecified witnesses and obtain experts (D.I. 8-3 at 12, 17); (6)\nClaim Seventeen \u2014 Petitioner was improperly denied a copy of the VOP hearing\ntranscript and thereby improperly denied his appeal rights (D.I. 8-3 at 12, 17); (7)\nClaim Eighteen \u2014 Petitioner\u2019s sentence was unlawfully increased (D.I. 8-3 at 15);\n(8) Claim Nineteen \u2014judicial misconduct (D.I. 8-5 at 8-16); and (9) Claim Twenty\n\n\u2014 Generally alleging that the Delaware state courts violated Petitioner\u2019s rights\n\n19\nunder the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth,\nand Sixteenth Amendments (D.I. 56).\nAEDPA prescribes a one-year period of limitations for the filing of habeas\npetitions by state prisoners, which begins to run from the latest of:\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the\n\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time\nfor seeking such review;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an\napplication created by State action in violation of the\nConstitution or laws of the United States is removed, if\nthe applicant was prevented from filing by such State\naction;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted\n\nwas initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the\n\nright has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court\n\nand made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral\n\nreview; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim\n\nor claims presented could have been discovered through\n\nthe exercise of due diligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and\nequitable tolling. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling);\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may also be excused from\nfailing to comply with the limitations period by making a gateway showing of\nactual innocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4\" 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual\n\ninnocence exception).\n20\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court does not discern, any facts\ntriggering the application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (C) or (D). To the extent the Court\nshould construe Petitioner\u2019s contentions about alleged State-created impediments-\nto-filing as constituting an attempt to trigger a later starting date under \u00a7\n2244(d)(1)(B), the attempt is unavailing. Petitioner asserts that the State created\nunconstitutional impediments to his filing the instant Claims by limiting his access\nto the prison\u2019s law library, limiting and/or completely denying him access to the\ninternet, and charging a fee for the materials he uses in litigating his claims.\nPetitioner\u2019s complaints appear to stem from typical conditions of prison life, which\nnormally do not constitute unconstitutional state-created impediments. See, e.g.,\nMaclin v. Robinson, 74 Fed. App\u2019x 587, 589 (6th Cir. 2003) (limited access to\nprison law library does not constitute a state impediment), Fox v. Holland, 2016\nWL 4943003, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 16, 2016) (finding complaints about\ninconsistent hours at the prison\u2019s law library, the lack of internet access, and\ninability to make photocopies insufficient to excuse untimely habeas petition).\nPetitioner also does not have a constitutional right to receive unlimited legal\nresources at the State\u2019s expense, including unfettered access to the prison\u2019s law\nlibrary, and he has not demonstrated that he did not have a reasonable amount of\ntime to use the prison\u2019s legal resources. See Lindquist v. Idaho Bd. of Corr., 776\n\nF.2d 851, 858 (9th Cir. 1985) (\u201c[T]he Constitution does not guarantee a prisoner\n21\nunlimited access to a law library. Prison officials out of necessity must regulate the\ntime, manner, and place in which library facilities are used.\u201d). Nor is the\nrequirement that Petitioner pay for the materials he uses in litigating his claims\nautomatically a constitutional violation constituting an impediment. See Bounds v.\nSmith, 430 U.S. 817, 824-25 (1977) (requiring the government to provide indigent\ninmates with pens, paper, notarial services, and stamps for legal documents);\nPeterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1039 (3d Cir. 1988) (recognizing Bounds but\ndenying preliminary injunction requiring state to supply at no cost to inmates with\nfunds in institutional accounts \u201cpads, pens, pencils, postage, photocopying and\nother legal materials\u201d where inmates had not otherwise shown irreparable injury);\nAshely v. Dudlek, 1995 WL 562292, at *7 (D. Del. Aug. 25, 1995) (\u201cTo the extent\nthat this claim does not implicate a core Bounds issue, however, plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that some actual injury occurred.\u201d). Petitioner has not established that\n\u201cthere was any instance in which [he was] unable to pursue any legal action\u201d due\nto any requirement that he pay costs. Peterkin, 855 F.2d at 1039.\n\nIn sum, Petitioner has not provided support for these conclusory and overly\nbroad allegations and, therefore, has not demonstrated how these alleged\nimpediments actually prevented him from filing a habeas petition. Moreover,\nPetitioner\u2019s allegations about impediments to pursuing his legal claims are belied\n\nby his voluminous filings in this case and the numerous state postconviction filings\n22\nmade after 2012. Therefore, the Court concludes that the one-year period of\nlimitations began to run when Petitioner\u2019s 2012 VOP judgment became final under\n\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court\njudgment but does not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes\nfinal, and the statute of limitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day\ntime period allowed for seeking certiorari review. See Kapral v. United States, 166\nF.3d 565, 575, 578 (3d Cir. 1999); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir.\n1999). In this case, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s 2012 VOP\njudgment on February 4, 2013, and he did not seek review by the United States\nSupreme Court. As a result, his judgment of conviction became final on May 6,\n2013.\u2019 Yet, since the Superior Court subsequently modified Petitioner\u2019s VOP\nsentence on December 30, 2014, (D.I. 104-20 at 52), the modified sentence date\nbecomes the relevant date for determining the finality of Petitioner\u2019s judgment\nunder \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). See Cochran v. Phelps, 600 F. Supp. 2d 603, 607 (D. Del.\n2009). Petitioner did not appeal his modified sentence and, therefore, his VOP\njudgment became final thirty days later, on January 29, 2015. Applying the one-\n\nyear limitations period to that date, Petitioner had until January 29, 2016 to timely\n\n7The last day of the ninety-day period to seek certiorari review fell on May 5,\n2013, which was a Sunday. Therefore, the period extended to the end of Monday,\nMay 6, 2013. See U.S. Supr. Ct. R. 39(1).\n\n23\nfile a habeas petition challenging his 2012 VOP. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d\n653, 662-64 (3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations\nperiod); Phlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015)\n(AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is calculated according to the anniversary\nmethod, i.e., the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the date it began\nto run).\n\nPetitioner filed the instant Petition on January 8, 2020,\u00b0 almost four full\nyears after that deadline. Thus, the Petition is time-barred and should be\ndismissed, unless the limitations period can be statutorily or equitably tolled, or\nPetitioner makes a gateway showing of actual innocence. See Jones, 195 F.3d at\n158; see Wallace, 2 F.4\" at 151 (explaining that actual innocence is an \u201cexception\nto the statute of limitations\u201d rather than an \u201cextension to the statute of limitations\n\nvia equitable tolling.\u201d). The Court will discuss each doctrine in turn.\n\nPursuant to prisoner mailbox rule, the Court views the postmark date on the\nenvelope for Petitioner\u2019s initial Memorandum \u2014 January 8, 2020 \u2014 as the filing\ndate. See Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761 (3d Cir. 2003) (the date on\nwhich a prisoner transmitted documents to prison authorities for mailing is to be\nconsidered the actual filing date).\n\n24\n1. Statutory tolling\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state\ncourts, including any post-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed\nand pending before the expiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v.\nMeyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A post-conviction motion is\n\u201cproperly filed\u2019 for statutory tolling purposes when its delivery and acceptance is\nin compliance with the state\u2019s applicable laws and rules governing filings, such as\nthe form of the document, any time limits upon its delivery, the location of the\nfiling, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d Crump v. Phelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D.\nDel. 2008). The limitations period is also tolled for the time during which an\nappeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed even if the appeal is not\neventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. The limitations period, however, is\nnot tolled during the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state\npost-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att\u2019y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539,\n542 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\nHere, the one-year limitations period began to run on January 30, 2015, and\n\n25\nran without interruption until it expired one year later, on February 1, 2016.?\nPetitioner\u2019s March 2015 motion for modification of sentence that he filed in the\nSuperior Court does not statutorily toll the limitations period because it was\ndismissed as untimely and, therefore, was not properly filed. Thus, statutory\ntolling does not render Claims Twelve to Twenty timely filed.\n2. Equitable tolling\n\nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare\ncircumstances when the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\nand prevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the\ndiligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to\nthe petitioner\u2019s excusable neglect. Jd. at 651-52. Additionally, the obligation to\nact diligently \u201cdoes not pertain solely to the filing of the federal habeas petition,\nrather it is an obligation that exists during the period [the petitioner] is exhausting\nstate court remedies as well.\u201d LaCava v. Kyler, 398 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 2005).\nAs for the extraordinary circumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not\nwhether the circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner,\nbut how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year\n\u00b0The last day of the limitations period ended on January 30, 2016, which was a\nSaturday. Therefore, the limitations period extended through the end of the day on\n\nMonday, February 1, 2016. See Fed. R. Civ. 6(a)(3).\n26\ndeadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An\nextraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal\nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the\npetitioner\u2019s failure to file a timely federal petition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784,\n803 (3d. Cir. 2013).\n\nTo the extent Petitioner\u2019s already-discussed contention concerning the\nalleged State-created impediments to filing should also be viewed as an attempt to\ndemonstrate that those alleged impediments constitute extraordinary circumstances\ntriggering equitable tolling, his argument is unavailing. Petitioner does not provide\nany support for his conclusory assertions and, once again, the numerous state\npostconviction filings and litigation since 2012 belie his argument that he was\nunable to timely pursue habeas relief for Claims Twelve through Twenty. Nor\ndoes any limitation on Petitioner\u2019s ability to access the internet constitute an\nextraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling, because he has not\ndemonstrated how that alleged restricted access prevented him from timely\npursuing relief for the instant Claims. See Hartmann, 2004 WL 2713104, at *4.\nFinally, to the extent Petitioner\u2019s late filing in this Court was due to a lack of legal\nknowledge or miscalculation of AEDPA\u2019s one-year filing period, such\ncircumstances do not warrant equitably tolling the limitations period. See Taylor v.\n\nCarroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May 14, 2004).\n27\nGiven these circumstances, the Court concludes that equitable tolling is not\n\navailable to Petitioner on the facts he has presented.\n3. Actual innocence\n\nA credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d\nthat can overcome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. See\nMcQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4\" at 150-151.\nPetitioner, however, has not provided new reliable evidence of his actual\ninnocence.\n\nAccordingly, for all these reasons, the Court concludes that Claims Twelve\n\nthrough Twenty should be dismissed as time-barred.\n\nC. Claims Twenty-One to Thirty-One: Challenges to Petitioner\u2019s 2019\nVOP\n\nPetitioner asserts the following ten Claims challenging his 2019 VOP\ndecision: (1) Claim Twenty-One \u2014 Petitioner did not receive timely notice of the\n2019 VOP proceedings (D.I. 8-3 at 4, 6; D.I. 8-4 at 8); (2) Claim Twenty-Two \u2014\nthe State violated Petitioner\u2019s due process rights by proceeding to a VOP hearing\npursuant to an administrative warrant rather than pursuant to a formal arrest\nwarrant or a grand jury indictment (D.I. 8-3 at 10; D.I 8-4 at 2); (3) Claim Twenty-\nThree \u2014 there was insufficient evidence to support the VOP finding because the\nState relied on hearsay, there was no corpus delicti or independent proof of his\n\n28\ncriminal conduct, and the State did not \u201callege and prove\u201d the required\n\u201cknowingly, intelligently, and intentionally\u201d elements for the criminal charges\n(D1. 8 at 27; D.I 8-3 at 7); (4) Claim Twenty-Four \u2014 the State maliciously\nprosecuted Petitioner (D.I. 8-3 at 7); (5) Claim Twenty-Five \u2014 the State had a duty\nto represent all members of the public (including Petitioner), and it violated that\nduty in prosecuting the VOP (D.L. 8 at 30); (6) Claim Twenty-Six \u2014 Petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance during the VOP hearing by not challenging\nthe administrative warrant, requesting a bill of particulars, preparing for the\nhearing, investigating illegal conduct by the State\u2019s witnesses and others associated\nwith the Department of Corrections, effectively cross-examining the State\u2019s\nwitnesses at the hearing, and retaining unspecified experts (DI. 8 at 26, 28); (7)\nClaim Twenty-Seven \u2014 the State\u2019s witnesses at the hearing conspired to withhold\nexculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) (D.L 8\nat 27); (8) Claim Twenty-Eight \u2014 Petitioner was not provided with Miranda\n\n99 669.\n\nwarnings prior to \u201cinterrogations\u201d \u201cin alleged treatment groups,\u201d and the group\nsessions and polygraph testing have forced Petitioner to incriminate himself in\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment (DI. 8-3 at 3, 10, 22); (9) Claim Twenty-Nine \u2014\nPetitioner\u2019s probationary conditions were involuntarily imposed (D.I. 8-3 at 3);\n\n(10) Claim Thirty \u2014 Petitioner was entitled to representation by counsel on appeal\n\nfrom the Superior Court\u2019s 2019 VOP decision (D.L. 8 at 28); and (11) Claim\n29\nThirty-One \u2014 the Delaware courts violated Petitioner\u2019s rights under the First,\nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth\nAmendments (D.I. 56).\n\n1. Claims Twenty-One and Twenty-Six to Thirty-One are\nprocedurally barred\n\nPetitioner presented Claim Twenty-Six (ineffective assistance of counsel) to\nthe Delaware Supreme Court on appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s 2019 VOP\ndecision. The Delaware Supreme Court refused to consider the argument because,\nunder well-settled Delaware law, ineffective assistance of counsel claims cannot be\nraised on direct appeal; rather, they must be raised for the first time in a Rule 61\nmotion for post-conviction relief. See Hartmann, 2019 WL 6813986, at *2. By\napplying the well-established Delaware rule that ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims cannot be presented for the first time on direct appeal, the Delaware\nSupreme Court articulated a \u201cplain statement\u201d under Harris v. Reed that its\ndecision rested on a state law ground that is an independent and adequate state\nprocedural rule effectuating a procedural default. See Ducote v. Phelps, 2010 WL\n3860995, at *8 n.5 (D. Del. Sept. 28, 2010). Therefore, the Court cannot review\nthe merits of Claim Twenty-Six absent a showing of cause for the default, and\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage of justice will\noccur if the Claim is not reviewed.\n\n30\nIn turn, the record reveals that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for\nClaims Twenty-One and Twenty-Seven to Thirty-One because he did not present\nthe Claims to the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal from his 2019 VOP decision.\nAt this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to raise the Claims in a new Rule 61\nmotion would be barred as untimely under Delaware Superior Court Rule 61(i)(1)\nand as second or successive under Rule 61(i)(2). See Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R.\n61(i)(1) (establishing a one-year deadline for filing Rule 61 motions); Del. Super.\nCt. Crim. R. 61(i)(2) (providing that second or successive motions shall be\nsummarily dismissed unless they meet the pleading requirements of Rule\n61(d)(2)(i) or (ii)). Although Rule 61provides for an exception to its procedural\nbars if a Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is newly\nrecognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is implicated in\nthe instant Claims. Similarly, the exceptions to the bars contained in Rule 61(i)(5)\nand (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner\u2019s case, because he does not allege actual\ninnocence, lack of jurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies.\nTherefore, Claims Twenty-One and Twenty-Seven through Thirty-One are\nprocedurally defaulted, which means that the Court cannot review their merits\nabsent a showing of either cause and prejudice or that a miscarriage of justice will\n\nresult absent such review.\n\n31\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court cannot discern, any cause for his\nfailure to include Claims Twenty-One and Twenty-Seven to Thirty-One in his\nappeal to the Delaware Supreme Court from the denial of the Superior Court\u2019s\n2019 VOP decision.!\u00b0 To the extent the Court should construe Petitioner\u2019s\ncontention regarding the previously discussed alleged State-created impediments to\nfiling as an attempt to establish cause for his failure to present Claim Twenty-Six\nin a Rule 61 motion to the Superior Court, the attempt is unavailing. The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s 2019 VOP decision on December 12,\n2019\"! and, in that decision, indicated how Petitioner could properly present an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim to the Delaware state courts. Yet, less than\none month later, instead of filing a Rule 61 motion in the Superior Court, Petitioner\nfiled his Petition in this proceeding (see DI. 3). These events demonstrate that the\nalleged impediments did not prevent Petitioner from pursuing federal habeas relief\n\nand suggest that his failure to file a Rule 61 motion asserting the ineffective\n\n10The Court does not view Petitioner\u2019s previously discussed assertion regarding the\nalleged State-created impediments to filing as an attempt to establish cause for his\ndefault of Claims Twenty-One and Twenty-Seven through Thirty-One. Petitioner\nwas able to timely file a pro se appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s 2019 VOP\ndecision that included Claims Twenty-One through Twenty-Six despite the alleged\nState-created impediments, (D.I. 104-19), and the Court cannot discern any reason\nwhy those alleged impediments to filing would have prevented Petitioner from\nincluding some grounds for relief while not preventing him from including other\ngrounds.\n\n(DI. 104-21); see Hartmann, 2019 WL 6813986, at *3.\n32\nassistance of counsel argument in Claim Twenty-Six was the result of a purposeful\ndecision.\n\nThe absence of cause eliminates the need to address the issue of prejudice.\nAdditionally, Petitioner has not satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception to the\nprocedural default doctrine because he has not provided new reliable evidence of\nhis actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims Twenty-One and\nTwenty-Six through Thirty-One as procedurally barred.\n\n2. Section 2254(d) and Claims Twenty-Two, Twenty-Three, and\nTwenty-Five\n\nPetitioner presented Claims Twenty-Two, Twenty-Three and Twenty-Five\nto the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s 2019 VOP\ndecision. The Delaware Supreme Court denied the Claims as meritless. Therefore,\nPetitioner will only be entitled to habeas relief for the instant Claims if the\nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law, or was based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts.\n\na. Claim Twenty-Two\n\nIn Claim Twenty-Two, Petitioner appears to contend that his due process\nrights were violated because the State \u201cfraudulently and deceitfully\u201d proceeded to a\nVOP hearing pursuant to an administrative warrant rather than a criminal warrant\n\n33\nor grand jury indictment. (D.I. 8-3 at 10-11; D.L. 8-4 at 2) Petitioner presented a\nsubstantially similar argument to the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal from the\n2019 VOP decision by arguing that he was denied due process because there was\nno indictment for the new VOP charge. (D.I. 104-19 at 5) The Delaware Supreme\nCourt denied the argument because Petitioner\u2019s VOP proceeding was not a\ncriminal trial and the State was not required to file new criminal charges against\nhim. See Hartmann, 2019 WL 6813986, at *2.\n\nA \u201cperson's right to reasonable notice of a charge against him ... [is] basic in\nour system of jurisprudence.\u201d Jn re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273 (1948). It is well-\nsettled that due process requires an accused to be informed of the specific charge\nagainst him,'? and that reasonable notice \u201csufficiently apprises the defendant of\nwhat he must be prepared to meet.\u201d Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 763\n(1962). However, the Supreme Court has never held that \u201cthe only constitutionally\nsufficient means of providing the notice required by the Sixth and Fourteenth\nAniendments is through the charging document.\u201d Hartman v. Lee, 283 F.3d 190,\n195 (4th Cir. 2002). Indeed, federal courts considering the issue have held that the\ndue process notice requirement may be satisfied even if the indictment or\ninformation was deficient so long as the defendant received actual notice of the\n\ncharges against him and the inadequate indictment did not lead to a trial with an\n\n2Se\u00a2e Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201 (1948).\n34\nunacceptable risk of convicting the innocent. See Hartman, 283 F.3d at 195; Parks\nv. Hargett, 1188 F.3d 519 (Table), 1999 WL 157431 (10th Cir. Mar. 23, 1999);\nHulstine v. Morris, 819 F.2d 861, 864 (8th Cir.1987). In order for notice to be\neffective, \u201cit need only assure that the [probationer] understands the nature of the\nalleged violation.\u201d United States v. Sistrunk, 612 F.3d 988, 992 (8th Cir.2010).\nIt is also well-settled that \u201cthe revocation of parole is not part of a criminal\n\nprosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a\nproceeding does not apply to parole revocations.\u201d Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S.\n471, 480 (1972); see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973).\n\u201c[R]evocation proceedings are informal proceedings \u2018more flexible than a criminal\ntrial.\u2019\u201d United States v. Pinkney, 210 F. App\u2019x 223, 227 (3d Cir. 2007).\nConsequently, there are minimal due process requirements that must be observed\nduring probation revocation proceedings, including:\n\n(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b)\n\ndisclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c)\n\nopportunity to be heard in person and to present\n\nwitnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to\n\nconfront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the\n\nhearing officer specifically finds good cause for not\n\nallowing confrontation); (e ) a \u2018neutral and detached\u2019\n\nhearing body such as a traditional parole board, members\n\nof which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f)\n\na written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence\nrelied on and reasons for revoking parole.\n\n35\nGagnon, 411 U.S. at 786. In addition, there is no federal constitutional right to a\ngrand jury in state criminal proceedings. See Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S.\n625, 633 (1972) (\u201c[T]he Court has never held that federal concepts of a \u2018grand\njury,\u2019 binding on the federal courts under the Fifth Amendment, are obligatory for\nthe States.\u201d).\n\nHere, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not cite any United States\nSupreme Court precedent when it rejected Petitioner\u2019s contention that the State\nviolated his due process rights by pursuing a parole violation hearing without first\nobtaining a criminal indictment, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was\nneither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application, the clearly established\nprinciples articulated in Morissey, Gagnon, and Alexander. The administrative\nwarrant and VOP Report issued prior to Petitioner\u2019s VOP hearing clearly state that\nPetitioner violated his probation by having sexual contact with a minor. (D.I. 104-\n20 at 53) Even though the record does not reflect if Petitioner was served with\nthese documents, the transcript of the VOP hearing reveals that the allegations in\nthe administrative warrant and VOP report were the focus of the hearing. (D.I.\n104-2 at 71-72) Importantly, at no point during that hearing did Petitioner assert\nthat he lacked actual notice of the alleged probation violations. (D.I. 104-20 at 65-\n76) Petitioner also does not explain how his defense to the 2019 VOP would have\n\ndiffered had he received another type of written notice of his probation violations.\n36\nGiven these circumstances, the Court will deny Claim Twenty-Two for failing to\nsatisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\nb. Claim Twenty-Three\n\nIn Claim Twenty-Three, Petitioner contends there was insufficient evidence\nto support the Superior Court\u2019s 2019 VOP finding. He argues that the State\nimpermissibly relied on hearsay, and that there was no corpus delicti or\nindependent proof of his criminal conduct. (D.I. 8 at 27; D.I. 8-3 at 7) Petitioner\nalso appears to argue that the State was required to prove the VOP beyond a\nreasonable doubt. (D.I. 8 at 27) Petitioner raised substantially similar claims to\nthe Delaware Superior Court on appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s VOP finding.\n(D.I. 104-19 at 2-4) The Delaware Supreme Court rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument\nand held that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to support the Superior Court\u2019s finding\nthat [Petitioner] had violated his probation.\u201d Jd.\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing an insufficient evidence claim\nfor criminal convictions is the rule articulated by the United States Supreme Court\nin Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Pursuant to Jackson, \u201cthe relevant\nquestion is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Jd. at 319. Yet, as the Morissey Court\n\nexplained, \u201cthe full panoply of rights due a defendant in [a criminal proceeding]\n37\ndoes not apply to parole revocations.\u201d Morissey 408 U.S. at 480; see United States\nv. Knights, 534 U.S. 112, 120 (2001) (probationers re-engaging in criminal\nactivities \u201cface risk of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings in\nwhich the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, among other\nthings, do not apply\u201d). Consequently, in probation revocation proceedings, the\ngovernment must prove a violation of probation by a preponderance of the\nevidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Dees, 467\nF.3d 847, 855 (3d Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Hicks, 510 F. App\u2019x 167,\n177 (3d Cir. 2013). The Supreme Court defines a preponderance of the evidence\nas proof which leads the fact finder to conclude \u201cthat the existence of a fact is more\nprobable than its nonexistence.\u201d In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 371 (1970) (Harlan,\nJ., concurring). When applying the preponderance of the evidence standard, a\ncourt may consider hearsay evidence without violating the probationer\u2019s due\nprocess rights. See United States v. Stephens, 519 F. App\u2019x 94, 95 (3d Cir. 2013).\n\nIn turn, at least two federal circuit courts have found that the corpus delicti rule\"? is\n\n3The corpus delicti rule \u201cprohibits the prosecution from proving the corpus delicti\nbased solely on a defendant's extra-judicial statements.\u201d Corpus delicti rule,\nBlack's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). See also Warszower v. United States, 312\nUSS. 342, 347 (1941) (\u201cThe rule requiring corroboration of confessions protects the\nadministration of the criminal law against errors in convictions based upon untrue\nconfessions alone.\u201d).\n\n38\ninapplicable to revocation proceedings. See United States v. Riley, 920 F.3d 200,\n208-09 (4% Cir. 2019); United States v. Hilger, 728 F.3d 947, 950 (9\" Cir. 2013).\nThe Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision that there was sufficient evidence\nsupporting the Superior Court\u2019s finding that Petitioner violated his probation was\nneither contrary to, nor based on an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nfederal law. During the VOP hearing, Ms. Holloway \u2014 the director of the sex\noffender program at Connections \u2014 testified and explained how Petitioner admitted\nto having sexual contact with someone he had met at a coffee shop who was under\nthe age of eighteen. Id. Senior Probation and Parole Officer'* Johnson\ncorroborated Ms. Holloway\u2019s testimony by testifying about Petitioner\u2019s admissions\nto her. Id. Officer Johnson also testified that Petitioner\u2019s GPS monitoring device\nshowed that he was spending a substantial amount of time at a coffee shop. Id.\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel cross-examined both individuals. Petitioner\u2019s counsel argued\nthat the testimony describing Petitioner\u2019s statements during group therapy did not e\n\u201ccompetent evidence to show that [Petitioner] committed the offense in question.\u201d\n(D.I. 104-20 at 73) Petitioner\u2019s counsel also argued that the corpus delicti rule\napplied and required \u201csome reason to believe that [Petitioner] has actually done\nthis [act] other than his own statements.\u201d (D.I. 104-20 at 74) The State responded,\n\narguing that: (1) the evidence presented was \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d because\n\nM4(See D.I. 104-20 at 69)\n39\nPetitioner\u2019s \u201cstatements were not hearsay as they were statements by a party\nopponent\u201d; and (2) it was \u201cnot aware of authority to the effect that there\u2019s a corpus\ndelicti requirement for a violation of probation,\u201d and the GPS records provided\n\u201csufficient corroboration of the [Petitioner\u2019s] story.\u201d (/d.) After stating that it had\nconsidered \u201call the evidence presented as well as the arguments of counsel,\u201d the\nSuperior Court held that \u201cthe State has shown by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat [Petitioner] violated the conditions of his probation.\u201d (/d.)\n\nOn appeal, Petitioner argued that there was insufficient evidence to support\nthe Superior Court\u2019s finding that he violated his probation and that the State\u2019s\nevidence only consisted of hearsay. After noting that the rules of evidence are\nrelaxed in a VOP hearing, the Delaware Supreme Court explained that the \u201csex\noffender conditions that [Petitioner] singed upon his release from incarceration to\nprobation were admitted into evidence,\u201d and the conditions \u201cincluded a\nrequirement that [Petitioner] have no contact with anyone under the age of\neighteen.\u201d Hartmann, 2019 WL 6813986, at *2. Citing Delaware Rule of\nEvidence 801, the Delaware Supreme Court rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument that his\nstatements to Ms. Holloway and Officer Johnson were hearsay, explaining that a\nparty\u2019s own statement that is offered against him is \u201can admission by a party-\nopponent and is not hearsay.\u201d Jd. Viewing Petitioner\u2019s admissions to Ms.\n\nHolloway and Officer Johnson under the preponderance of the evidence standard,\n40\nthe Delaware Supreme Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the\nSuperior Court\u2019s finding that Petitioner violated his probation. See id.\n\nUpon thorough review of the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware\ncourts neither unreasonably determined the facts nor unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished federal law when holding that there was sufficient evidence to support\nthe Superior Court\u2019s violation finding. In concluding that there was sufficient\nevidence to support the Superior Court\u2019s VOP finding, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt reasonably relied on the probation conditions in the document that\nPetitioner had signed upon his release from incarceration, which explicitly\nincluded the requirement that Petitioner could not have contact with anyone under\neighteen years old. See United States v. Poellintz, 372 F.3d 562, 566 (3d Cir.\n2004) (noting that a \u201ccourt can revoke probation when it is reasonably satisfied that\nthe probation conditions have been violated, without the government being\nrequired to present proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed\nthe alleged acts.\u201d). Additionally, the Delaware state courts reasonably applied\nfederal law when they implicitly rejected Petitioner\u2019s contention that the corpus\ndelicti rule applied in his VOP proceeding, and the Court defers to the Delaware\nstate courts\u2019 conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s admissions to Ms. Holloway and Officer\nJohnson were not hearsay under D.R.E. 801. See Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S.\n\n74, 76 (2005); Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975) (\u201cState courts are the\n41\nultimate expositors of state law.\u201d). Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim\nTwenty-Three for failing to satisfy the requirements articulated in \u00a7 2254(d).\nc. Claim Twenty-Five\n\nIn Claim Twenty-Five, Petitioner contends that the State violated a duty to\nrepresent the public, including himself. (D.I. 8-3 at 7) Petitioner argues that the\nState failed \u201cits duty to expose con-job, conspirators, extortionists [...] reporting\nto police.\u201d (D.I. 8 at 27) Petitioner raised a substantially similar argument to the\nDelaware Supreme Court on appeal from his 2019 VOP. (D.I. 8-3 at 7) The\nDelaware Supreme Court denied the argument as meritless.\n\nAlthough not entirely clear, Petitioner\u2019s allegations of extortion and\nconspiracy appear to be an attempt to establish the falsity of the information that\nwas provided to the police about his actions that led to the VOP charges. The\nCourt has thoroughly reviewed the record and has found no facts to support\nPetitioner\u2019s rather oblique allegation that the State failed to uncover any\nconspiracy, acts of extortion, or false accusations related to Petitioner\u2019s activities.\nTherefore, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not\nunreasonably determine the facts when denying the instant argument.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Twenty-Five as factually baseless.\n\n42\n3. Claim Twenty-Four\n\nLiberally construing Claim Twenty-Four, Petitioner appears to contend that\nthe State maliciously prosecuted him by initiating the 2019 VOP proceeding. (DIL.\n8 at 30; DI. 8-3 at 7) Although Petitioner presented a malicious prosecution\nargument to the Delaware Supreme Court on appeal from his 2019 VOP decision\n(D.I. 104-1 at 2), the Delaware Supreme Court did not address it. See generally\nHartmann, 2019 WL 6813986. Typically, in these circumstances, the Court would\nreview Petitioner\u2019s malicious prosecution argument de novo. See Holloway v.\nHorn, 355 F.3d 707, 718-19 (3d Cir. 2004). Yet, a claim alleging malicious\nprosecution is viewed as a common law tort cause of action that is usually\npresented in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 rather than in a habeas\nproceeding. See Williams v. Winter, 2022 WL 3702930, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 5,\n2022); Peacock v. New Mexico, 2021 WL 3602519, at *2 (D. N.M Aug. 13, 2021);\nBazley v Ladreyt, 2016 WL 9110365, at *11 (ED. La. Feb. 17, 2016).\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss Claim Twenty-Four for failing to assert an\nissue cognizable on federal habeas review.\n\nD. Additional Noncognizable Claims\n\nPetitioner presents the following additional claims asserting errors of\nDelaware statutory or constitutional law: (1) the Superior Court unlawfully\n\nincreased his sentences in 2011 and 2019 in violation of 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4333 (DI.\n43\n8-3 at 15); (2) \u201ccriminal sentences [were] not provided lowest sentence[] standard\nfor criminal charges, without required reasoning for higher sentences on the\nrecord\u201d (D.L. 8-3 at 10); (3) he was wrongfully sentenced to complete the\nTransitions Sex Offender Program (D.I. 8-3 at 14, 22); (4) \u201c[s]sentencing law does\nnot allow judges to use imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation\u201d (DI.\n8-4 at 15); (5) he has experienced numerous violations of the Delaware\nconstitution (D.I. 31-1); and (6) the Delaware Supreme Court failed to address\nPetitioner\u2019s motion for an extension of time (D.I. 8-3 at 25). Petitioner also\n\npresents the following issues concerning the conditions of his confinement: (1) he\n\ndoes not have internet access (D.I. 8-3 at 14); (2) he has suffered from abuse,\nneglect, torture, mistreatment and terror by the DOC staff (D.I. 8-4 at 16, 18); (3)\nhis health care is inadequate (D.I. 8-2 at 26-27; D.I. 8-4 at 21); (4) he has been\nsubjected to unlawful searches and seizures (D.1. 8-2 at 20); (5) the State has not\nprovided accommodations for his disabilities (D.I. 8-2 at 29); and (6) the prison\u2019s\ngrievance process is inadequate (D.I. 8-2 at 28; D.J. 8-4 at 21; D.I. 65). Finally,\nPetitioner appears to contend that his group therapy sessions forced him to disclose\nprivate health information to group members in violation of the Health Insurance\n\nPortability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). (DL. 8-3 at 23)\n\n44\nNone of these claims \u2014 which either present errors of Delaware law or\nchallenge the conditions of Petitioner\u2019s confinement \u2014 assert issues that are\ncognizable on federal habeas review. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68\n(1991) (reiterating that \u201cit is not the province of a federal habeas court to\nreexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. In conducting habeas\nreview, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the\nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d); Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d\n532, 542 (3d Cir. 2002) (explaining that \u201cwhen the challenge is to a condition of\nconfinement such that a finding in plaintiff's favor would not alter his sentence or\nundo his conviction, an action under \u00a7 1983 is appropriate.\u201d). In addition, since\nHIPAA does not provide individuals with a private right of action or constitutional\nclaim, Petitioner\u2019s HIPAA argument does not assert an issue cognizable on federal\nhabeas review. See, e.g., Polanco v. Omnicell, Inc., 988 F. Supp. 2d 451, 469\n(D.N.J. 2013). Therefore, the Court will dismiss the instant Claims for failing to\nassert issues cognizable on habeas review.\n\nE. Vague, Unintelligible, and Conclusory Claims\n\nPetitioner also asserts the following claims for relief: (1) \u201c[p]rior\n[e]xhausted [g]rounds in [p]rior [h]abeas [c]orpus petition\u201d (D.I. 8-1 at 13 of 30);\n(2) \u201c[flamily rights omitted, denied, ignored, obstructed to, deliberately\n\nindifferently\u201d (/d.); (3) the State failed to allege \u201ccriminal negligence, criminal\n45\nintention, criminally knowingly, acting criminally recklessly, not knowledge of\nrisk\u201d (D.I. 8-4 at 1); (4) the State did not \u201callege and prove consciousness of guilt\ncriminally\u201d (d.); (5) the State did not \u201callege and prove criminal liability as to a\nvoluntary act to do a crime\u201d (Id.); (6) the State did not \u201callege and prove\nindividualized proof of [Petitioner\u2019s] state-of-mind\u201d (/d.); (7) \u201c[b]ail not proven to\nprevent damage[,] release only for non-indigent discriminatory[,] damages from\nimprisonment[,] not individualized\u201d (/d.); (8) \u201c[t]ime of alleged occurrences had to\nbe proven\u201d (/d.); (9) various words are \u201ctoo vague, overbroad, and/or relative, too\ndependent on one[\u2019]s experiences\u201d (D.I. 8-4 at 2-4); (10) the \u201cState did not allege\nand prove causation conduct by [Petitioner]\u201d (D.I. 8-4 at 5); (11) \u201c\u2018[nJatural and\nprobable consequences\u2019 did not mean [Petitioner] did the alleged charges\u201d (/d.);\n(12) the \u201cState failed to allege and prove the circumstances surrounding \u2018the acts\u2019\nalleged\u201d (D.I. 8-4 at 6); (13) \u201c\u2018[p]rima facie\u2019 is wrongful description to be\nsufficient for these [two] criminal charges\u201d OL 8-4 at 7); (14) \u201c\u2018Certain\u2019 requires\ncertainty, dependable, factually based, indisputable, undeniable allegations by\nState\u201d (Id.); as) \u201c{mJorality cannot be legislated nor enforced by a court, as State\ndepends on, and convict on because there was no actual injury, no victim, legal\nmorality element required\u201d (D.I. 8-4 at 14); \u201c(16) [legal elements and sentencing\nguidelines for assault, battery and bodily damaging conduct/crimes, and unlawful\n\nsexual contact not equal, meaningful, capably, empirically distinguished injury\n46\nlevels, conclusive and fair, but presumptive, wrongfully subjective, bias, prejudice,\nand discriminatory, at the WWAB (whims, winds, attitudes, beliefs of each person,\nin the moment, of current knowledge, wisdom)\u201d (/d.); (17) Petitioner\u2019s \u201cVOP\nhearing sentence was more than original criminal case\u201d (D.I. 8 at 28); and (18) the\n\u201cState failed to allege and prove how this defendant\u2019s society will be protected and\nneeded protecting\u201d (D.I. 8-4 at 15).\n\nThese vague, unintelligible, and conclusory arguments do not provide\nsufficient information for the Court to determine whether Petitioner\u2019s allegations\nwarrant relief. Consequently, the Court will dismiss the aforementioned arguments\nfor failing to \u201cstate facts that point to a real possibility of constitutional error.\u201d\nBlackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 76 n.7 (1977).\n\nF. Pending Motions\n\nThe following Motions are presently pending in this case: (1) Motion for\nRelease from Custody (D.I. 108); (2) combined Motion for the Appointment of\nCounsel, Striking the State\u2019s Answer, Immediate Release, and Default Judgment\n(D.I. 109); (3) Motion for Sealing When Appropriate and Affidavit (D.I. 111); (4)\nMotion for Appointment of Counsel (D.I. 112); (5) Motion for Waiver of Docket\nCopy Fees (D.I. 113); (6) Motion for Three Strikes Objections from Court\u2019s Order\n(D.I. 114); (6) Motion for Class of One Status (D.I. 115); and (7) Motion for Court\n\nDocuments (D.I. 119). Having determined that the instant Petition does not\n47\nwarrant habeas relief, the Court will dismiss all the aforementioned Motions as\nmoot. The Court also notes that three of the Motions (D.I. 108; D.I. 114; D.I. 115)\nare duplicative of motions Petitioner filed in his civil action, Hartmann v. Troxler,\nCiv. A. No. 21-1687-GBW. (See id. at D.I. 36; D.I. 38; D.I. 40)\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also\ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2\n(2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when\na petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by\ndemonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of\nthe constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). In addition, when a district court\ndenies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying\nconstitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability\nunless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1)\nwhether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and\n(2) whether the court was correct in its procedural ruling. See Slack, 529 U.S. at\n484.\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief.\n\nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly,\n48\nthe Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition must\nbe denied without an evidentiary or the issuance of a certificate of appealability.\nThe Court also orders all pending Motions (D.I. 108; D.I. 109; D.I. 111; D.I. 112;\nDI. 113; D.I. 114; D.L. 115; DL. 119) to be dismissed as moot. An appropriate\n\nOrder will be entered.\n\n49\n"}
