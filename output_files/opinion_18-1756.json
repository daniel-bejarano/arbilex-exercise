INTRODUCTION  \n Pending before the Court is an Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) filed by  Petitioner Myron Gibbs (\u201cPetitioner\u201d ).  (D.I. 1)  The State  filed \nan Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply.  (D.I. 12; D.I. 19)  For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the Petition as time-barred under the limitations period prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. II. BACKGROUND   \n[NB], who was 17 years old at the time of the incident, claimed that on \nNovember 12, 2009, while she was walking home in the rain, [Petitioner] stopped his truck and offered to give her a ride home.  Since it was raining, she accepted the ride.  Instead of taking her the \nshort distance to her home, [Petiti oner] made several other stops \naround the City of Wilmington and ultimately took her back to his \napartment on the other side of town.  At trial, [NB] testified that Petitioner forced her into his apartment, locked her in a room, tied her hands behind her back, pushed her repeatedly on the bed, slapped her, removed her pants and underwear, penetrated her vagina with his penis and ultimately ejaculated inside of her.  [NB] testified that when she was able to leave the apartment, she immediately went to her aunt\u2019s home a block away and called her father.  [NB] described going to the hospital, having an examination by the SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) nurse and speaking with Detective Ronald Mullin at the Wilmington Police Department.  [NB\u2019s] interview with Detective Mullin on the day of the incident, November 12, 2009, was recorded.  The DNA evidence at trial conclusi vely established that a sexual \nencounter occurred between [NB] and [Petitioner].  \nState v. Gibbs , 2015 WL 353932, at *1-2 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 27, 2015).   \n Petitioner was arrested on November 13, 2009.  (D.I. 12 at 1)  On  December 21, 2009, a \nNew Castle County grand jury indicted Petitioner on charges of first-degree rape, second-degree 3 \n kidnapping, fourth-degree rape, and offensive touching.  ( Id.)  Petitioner\u2019s case proceeded to a jury \ntrial in the Delaware Superior Court on June 29, 2010.  ( Id.)  Petitioner\u2019s defense theory was that the \nsexual encounter that occurred between NB and Petitioner on November 12, 2009 was consensual in nature.  See Gibbs , 2015 WL 353932, at *3.  On July 7, 2010, the jury found Petitioner guilty of \nsecond-degree rape (as a lesser-included offense of first-degree rape), fourth-degree rape, and \noffensive touching.  See id . at *3; D.I. 12 at 1.  The jury acquitted Petitioner of first-degree rape and \nsecond-degree kidnapping.  See id . at *3; D.I. 12 at 1-2.  On September 17, 2010, the Superior Court \nsentenced Petitioner to fifteen years in prison, follo wed by thirty months of decreasing levels of \nsupervision, and a $200 fine.  (D.I. 13-28 at 19-2 0)  On August 3, 2011, the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions on direct appeal.  See Gibbs v. State , 26 A.3d 213 (Table), 2011 \nWL 3427211, at *2 (Del. Aug. 3, 2011).   On July 27, 2012, Petitioner filed a pro se  motion for an extension of time to file a motion for \npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d).   \n(D.I. 13-1 at 7 Entry No. 52; D.I. 13-48)  On Au gust 6, 2012, while the motion for an extension of \ntime was still pending, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court his first pro se  Rule 61 motion.  (D.I 13-\n42)  The Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for an extension of time on August 2012.  (D.I. \n13-1 at 7 Entry No. 53; D.I. 13-43)  After filing several subsequent motions and amendments, \nPetitioner filed a motion for appointment of counsel in July 2013.  (D.I. 13-48; D.I. 13-52)  The \nSuperior Court granted the motion and appointed co unsel to represent Petitioner during his first \nRule 61 proceeding (\u201cpost-conviction counsel\u201d).  (D.I. 13-53)  Post-conviction counsel filed an \namended Rule 61 motion on Petitioner\u2019s behalf on June  2, 2014.  (D.I. 13-54)  The Superior Court \ndenied Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 61 motion on April 10, 2015.  See Gibbs , 2015 WL 353932, at *1.  4 \n Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware Supreme Cou rt affirmed that judgment on May 20, 2016. \n(D.I. 13-34; see also  Gibbs v. State, 140 A.3d 434 (Table), 2016 WL 3449916, at *1 (Del. May 20, 2016))   \n Petitioner filed a second pro se  Rule 61 motion on September 28, 2016, which the Superior \nCourt denied as procedurally barred on February 28, 2017.  (D.I. 13-57; D.I. 13-59; D.I. 13-60)  The \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Cour t\u2019s judgment on August 7, 2017.  (D.I. 13-38; \nGibbs v. State , 169 A.3d 859 (Table), 2017 WL 3392149 (Del. Aug. 7, 2017)) \n Petitioner filed a third pro se Rule 61 motion on November 15, 2017.  (D.I. 13-61)  The \nSuperior Court denied the third Rule 61 mo tion on March 15, 2018, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed that judgment on June 8, 2018.  (D.I. 13-65; D.I. 13-41; Gibbs v. State , 188 A.3d 823 \n(Table), 2018 WL 2769012 (Del. June 8, 2018))  Petitioner filed the instant Petition in Novemb er 2018, asserting two grounds for relief:  \n(1) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by stipulating that the State had proven an element of second-degree kidnapping and by failin g to \u201cobject to the State improperly amending its \nindictment;\u201d and (2) defense counsel provided ine ffective assistance by failing to investigate and \nsubpoena four witnesses to testify on his behalf to support the defense theory of consensual sex. \n(D.I. 1 at 7; D.I. 2 at 8-11, 20-21)   III.  ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS \n The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penal ty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) prescribes a one-\nyear period of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which begins to run \nfrom the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of \ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review; \n \n(B) the date on which the impediment  to filing an application created \nby State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United 5 \n States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such \nState action; \n \n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or \n \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. \n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).  AEDPA\u2019s limitations peri od is subject to statutory and equitable tolling, \nwhich, when applicable, may extend the filing period.  See Holland v. Florida , 560 U.S. 631, 645 (2010) \n(equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory  tolling).  A petitioner may also be excused from \nfailing to comply with the limitations period by  making a gateway showing of actual innocence.  See \nWallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F. 4\nth 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual innocence exception). \nPetitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 Petition, filed in 2018, is subject to the one-year limitations period \ncontained in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).  See Lindh v. Murphy , 521 U.S. 320, 336 (1997).  Petitioner does not allege, \nand the Court cannot discern, any facts triggering th e application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D).  \nGiven these circumstances, the one-year period of limitations began to run when Petitioner\u2019s \nconviction became final under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).  \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisone r appeals a state court conviction but does not \nseek certiorari review, his judgment of conviction b ecomes final, and the statute of limitations begins \nto run, upon expiration of the ninety-day peri od allowed for seeking certiorari review.  See Gonzalez v. \nThaler,  565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012).  The Delaware Su preme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction on \nAugust 3, 2011, and he did not seek certiorari review by the United States Supreme Court.  6 \n Consequently, his judgment of conviction became final on November 2, 2011.  Applying the one-\nyear limitations period to that date, Petitioner had until November 2, 2012 to timely file his Petition.2  \n  Petitioner electronically filed the instant Peti tion on November 4, 2018, six years after the \nexpiration of the limitations period.  Therefore, hi s habeas Petition is untimely, unless the limitations \nperiod can be statutorily or equitably tolled, or he demonstrates a gateway claim of actual innocence.  \nThe Court will discuss each doctrine in turn. \nA. Statutory Tolling  \n Pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly file d state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA\u2019s \nlimitations period during the time the action is  pending in the state courts, including any post-\nconviction appeals, provided th at the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of \nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period.  See Swartz v. Meyers , 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000); Price v. Taylor , \n2002 WL 31107363, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 23, 2002 ).  The limitations period, however, is not tolled \nduring the ninety days a petitioner ha s to file a petition for a writ of  certiorari in the United States \nSupreme Court regarding a judgment de nying a state post-conviction motion.  See Stokes v. Dist. \nAttorney of Philadelphia , 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir. 2001).  In  addition, a post-conviction motion that \n \n \n2The Court notes that 2012 was a leap year, consisti ng of 366 days.  Nevert heless, \u201c[e]very federal \ncourt that has addressed the issue has conclude d that [the] method in [Fed. R. Civ. P. 6], i.e., the \n\u2018anniversary\u2019 method, for calculating a time pe riod applies to [] AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation \nperiod.\u201d  Nunez v. California , 2014 WL 809206, at *3 n.9 (N.D. Oh io Feb. 25, 2014) (collecting cases); \nsee also  Dennis v. Crow , 791 F. App\u2019x 775, 776 (10th Cir. Jan. 29, 2020).  \u201cUnder the \u2018anniversary\u2019 \nmethod, the first day of the one-year limitations pe riod is the day after the triggering event, thus \ngiving petitioners \u2018until the close of business on the a nniversary date of ...\u2019 the triggering event to file \na federal habeas petition.\u201d  Id.  Using the anniversary method in this case (and, essentially, ignoring \nthe leap day), results in November 2, 2012 bein g the last day of AEDPA's limitations period. \n  7 \n is untimely under state law is not properly filed for \u00a7 2244(d)(2) purposes and, therefore, has no \nstatutory tolling effect.  See Pace v. DiGuglielmo , 544 U.S. 408, 414 (2005). \nHere, 277 days of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period la psed before Petitioner filed his first Rule 61 \nmotion on August 6, 2012.  The Superior Court denied the motion, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed that decision on May 20, 2016.  In  these circumstances, Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion \ntolled the limitations period from August 6, 20 12 through May 20, 2016.  The limitations clock \nstarted to run again on May 21, 2016, and ran the remaining eighty-eight days without interruption until the limitations period expired on August 17 , 2016.  Petitioner\u2019s second and third Rule 61 \nmotions \u2013 filed on September 28, 2016 and in No vember 2017, respectively \u2013 do not trigger any \nstatutory tolling, because they were filed after the limitations period expired.  Thus, even with the \napplicable statutory tolling, the Petition is time -barred, unless equitable tolling or the actual \ninnocence gateway exception apply. \nB. Equitable Tolling  \n AEDPA\u2019s limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in appropriate cases.  See \nHolland , 560 U.S. at 645.  A petitioner can only qualify  for equitable tolling by demonstrating \u201c(1) \nthat he has been pursuing his rights diligently, an d (2) some extraordinary circumstance stood in his \nway and prevented timely filing,\u201d id. at 648; mere  excusable neglect is insufficient .  Schlueter v. Varner , \n384 F.3d 69, 77 (3d Cir. 2004).  Consistent with these principles, the Third Circuit has limited the \nequitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period to the following circumstances: \n(1) where the defendant (or the court) actively misled the plaintiff; \n \n(2) where the plaintiff was in some extraordinary way prevented from asserting his rights; or \n \n(3) where the plaintiff timely asserted his rights mistakenly in the wrong forum. 8 \n  \nJones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 159 (3d Cir. 1999); see also Thomas v. Snyder , 2001 WL 1555239, at *3-4 \n(D. Del. Nov. 28, 2001). \nPetitioner does not explicitly assert that any extraordinary circumstance prevented him from \ntimely filing the instant Petition.  To the extent Peti tioner attempts to characterize the \u201cdelays\u201d in his \nRule 61 proceedings as extraordinary circumstances, the attempt is unavailing.  (D.I. 1 at 13-14; D.I. 19 at 1)  As just explained, the limitations pe riod was tolled during Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 61 \nproceeding, and Petitioner has not explained how he  was prevented from timely filing the instant \nPetition after the conclusion of the first Rule 61  proceeding.  Even if the Court were to view \nPetitioner\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a Rule 61 motion that he filed on July 27, 2012 as \nan event triggering equitable tolling,\n3 adding the extra ten days ( i.e., the days between July 27, 2012 \nand August 6, 2012) to the tolling computation does not render the Petition timely.  Finally, to the \nextent Petitioner\u2019s untimely filing of the Petition was due to his own ignorance of the law or the \nresult of his miscalculation regarding the one- year filing period, such factors do not warrant \nequitably tolling the limitations period.  See Taylor v. Carroll , 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May \n14, 2004). \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that that the doctrine of equitable tolling is not \navailable to Petitioner on th e facts he has presented. \n      \n \n \n3The Court is not asserting that the motion for an extension of time should be viewed as a triggering \nevent for equitable tolling purposes.  Rather, the Court  only includes this hypothetical scenario to be \nthorough . 9 \n C. Actual Innocence \nA credible claim of actual innocence may se rve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that can \novercome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period.  See McQuiggin v. Perkins , 569 U.S 383, \n392 (2013); Wallace , 2 F. 4th at 150-151.  A petitioner sati sfies the actual innocence exception by  \n(1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his inno cence; and (2) showing \u201cby a preponderance of the \nevidence\u201d that \u201ca reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new evidence.\u201d  Wallace , 2 F.4th at 151.  Evidence is new for purposes of the actual innocence gateway, \neven if it was available for trial counsel through reasonable diligence, if trial counsel\u2019s failure to \ndiscover or present it is alleged as ineffective assistance of counsel.  See Reeves v. Fayette SCI , 897 F.3d \n154, 164 (3d Cir. 2018).  Three examples of relia ble evidence, in this context, are \u201cexculpatory \nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence.\u201d  Schlup v. Delo , \n513 U.S. 298, 324 (1995).   \nIn his Response, Petitioner avers that he \u201ca ctually did not commit the crimes [he] was \nconvicted of and [he] desperately tried to get ev idence presented in corroboration of this fact for \nseven long hard months but [he] could not get [his] attorney to do things he did not want to do.\u201d  \n(D.I. 19 at 8)  Petitioner asserts that he \u201cwould have taken the stand\u201d if defense counsel had called \n\u201call available witnesses\u201d to testify, and identifi es the following witnesses and their potential \ntestimony: (1) NB\u2019s aunt, who was the first eyewitness to see her after the rape, could have testified \nabout NB\u2019s lifestyle and criminal history as impeac hment evidence; (2) employees at the thrift store \nwhere Petitioner and NB stopped along their route could have testified that NB was with him \nwillingly before the rape; (3) a clerk at the liquor store where Petitioner purchased beer could have \ntestified that NB was with him willingly before the ra pe; and (4) a rebuttal expert witness.  (D.I. 1 at \n7; D.I. 2 at 20-21)  Petitioner does not identify  the evidence a rebuttal expert would have provided. 10 \n For the most part, Petitioner\u2019s conclusory and unsupported description of the potential \ntestimony these individuals could have provided constitutes evidence similar to and/or cumulative \nof what was already presented at trial.  Because  the potential testimony does not contradict the \ntestimony provided at trial, Petitioner has failed to  demonstrate that \u201cno juror, acting reasonably, \nwould have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d if the proposed additional \nwitnesses had testified.  McQuiggan , 569 U.S. at 386.  Therefore, Petitioner has failed to provide \nevidence sufficiently reliable and persuasive enough to satisfy the actual innocence gateway standard.   \nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the instant Petitioner as time-barred.4 \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY  A district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether to \nissue a certificate of appealability.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).  A federal \ncourt denying a habeas petition on procedural  grounds without reaching the underlying \nconstitutional claims is not required to issue a certificate of appealabili ty unless the petitioner \ndemonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid \nclaim of the denial of a constitu tional right; and (2) whether the co urt was correct in its procedural \nruling.  See Slack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).   \nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief because it is time-\nbarred.  Reasonable jurists would not find this conc lusion to be debatable.  Accordingly, the Court \ndeclines to issue a certificate of appealability. \n \n \n \n4Having determined that the Petition is time-barre d, the Court will not address the State\u2019s alternate \nreasons for dismissing the Petition. 11 \n V. CONCLUSION  \n For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the instant Petition as time-barred, and dismiss the pending Motion as moot.  The Court also declines to issue a certificate of appealability.  An appropriate Order will be entered.    IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \nMYRON V.
