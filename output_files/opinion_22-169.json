Pro Se Plaintiff.  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nMa\ny 6, 2022 \nWilmington, DelawareCase 1:22-cv-00169-RGA   Document 5   Filed 05/06/22   Page 1 of 6 PageID #: 201 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Shantell Newman  appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4 ).  She filed this case  on February  7, 2022 , and \nasserts jurisdiction on the grounds that the Morocco Peace Treaty of 1787 may have \nbeen violated.   (D.I. 2 at 3) .  The civil cover sheet refers to the Freedom of Information \nAct, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 .   (D.I. 2-1).  The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pu rsuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff refers to  the 1994 death of her grandmother, Vera \nMae Newman, as  the occur rence date.  Plaintiff explains that she was left her \ngrandmother\u2019s house and wants \u201ca [ disclosure ].\u201d  (D.I . 2 at 5).  Plaintiff wants the \n\u201coriginal of documents proving [her] grandmother who only loved [Plaintiff] and put \n[Plaintiff ] before her own children  would leave [Plaintiff] with no  home.  We kno w the \ncorporation of America may take this property because they may h ave had a birth \ncertificate leaving the straw man in c harge of [Plaintiff\u2019s] family rightful property  under \u201d \n42 U.S.C.  \u00a7 1983, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692f and \n1692g.  ( Id. at 5 -6) (spellings changed).  Plaintiff \u201cwould like to request all records and \nunclaimed property, lands, wills\u201d according to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  ( Id. at 6).  For relief s he seeks her family\u2019s genealogical records  under FOIA and \n$1,000,000 in damages.  ( Id. at 6 -7).     Case 1:22-cv-00169-RGA   Document 5   Filed 05/06/22   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 212 \n SCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which r elief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013).  S ee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations i n a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \na pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se , her \npleading is liberally construed and h er Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it  fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  I d.   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough,  184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless Case 1:22-cv-00169-RGA   Document 5   Filed 05/06/22   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 223 \n amendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 11.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016).  Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P . 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \n Defendants are Toni Newman, who is not otherwise identified, and Thomas \nTown, Maryland.  To  the extent Plaintiff raises claims under \u00a7 1983, the claims are time-\nbarred.  For purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions.   Wilson v. Garcia , 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985).  In Delaware,  Case 1:22-cv-00169-RGA   Document 5   Filed 05/06/22   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 234 \n \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two- year limitations period.  See  10 Del. C . \u00a7 8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F.  Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).  Section 1983 claims accrue \n\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is \nbased. \u201d  Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).  \n The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised.  See Benak ex rel. Alliance \nPremier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P ., 435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, 807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201cAlthough \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal  is appropriate \nwhen \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual record is required to be developed.\u2019\u201d  Davis v. Gauby , 408 F. App\u2019 x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010)  (quoting Fogle v. Pierson , 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)).   Accordingly a \ncourt may dismiss a time -barred complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \n The Complaint alleges wrongful acts occurred in 1994 upon the death of \nPlaintiff\u2019s grandmother.  Plaintiff d id not commence this action until February  7, 2022 .  It \nis evident from the face of the Complaint that all \u00a7 1983 claims are barred by the two-year limitation period.  \nIn addition, neither Defendant can be sued under \u00a7 1983.  There is no indication \nNewman is a state actor, and only individuals can be sued under \u00a7 1983, so there is no claim against Thomas Town either.  \n Case 1:22-cv-00169-RGA   Document 5   Filed 05/06/22   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 245 \n It is far from clear if Plaintiff raises claims  under the other statutes named in the \ncomplaint .  While Plaintiff speaks to FOIA, it does not appear that she has sought \nrecords under FOIA.  Rather, she would like to obtain records under FOIA and perhaps \nseeks the Court\u2019s assistance in that regard.  And she cannot use FOIA to obtain records \nfrom an individual or a municipality in Maryland.   \nThe other statu tes are referred to without sufficient facts to raise any viable \nclaims.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 689  (stating that a complaint will not suffice if it \u201coffers \n[merely] \u2018labels and conclusions \u2019 \u201c or \u201c \u2018naked asser tion [s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual \nenhancement\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 557). Indeed, merely reciting a  \nstatute, an element of a cause of action,  or making a bare conclusory statement is \ninsufficient to state a claim. See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at  689.   \nFinally,  after thoroughly reviewing the Complaint and applicable law, this Court \ndraws on its judicial experience and common sense and finds that the claims are frivolous.   The refore, the Complaint w ill be dismissed.    \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and ( ii) as frivolous and  time-barred.   The Court finds \namendment futile.  \n An ap propriate O rder will be entered.  Case 1:22-cv-00169-RGA   Document 5   Filed 05/06/22   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 25"}
