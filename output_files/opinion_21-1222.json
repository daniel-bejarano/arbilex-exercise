{"case_name": "Rodriguez v. Capital Vision Services, LLC", "case_number": "21-1222", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "02-15-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nJUAN L. RODRIGUEZ , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCAPITAL VISION SERVICES , LLC \nd/b/a MY EYE DOCTOR , \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 21-1222-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nBefore me is Defendant My Eye Doctor's motion for summary judgment. (D.I. 33). The \nmotion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 34, 39, 42). For the reasons set forth below, My Eye \nDoctor's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Juan L. Rodriguez filed this action on August 26, 2020, against his former \nemployer , Defendant Capital Vision Services, d/b/a My Eye Doctor, (hereinafter \"My Eye \nDoctor\"). (D.I. 1). He alleges unlawful sex, sexual orientation , race, national origin, age, and \ndisability discrimination , in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et. seq., (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1981, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, et. seq. (the ADEA), DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 710, 711 (Delaware 's \nDiscrimination in Employment Act, or DDEA), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, et seq. (the ADA). He \nalso alleges unlawful retaliation for the exercise of his FMLA rights, as well as unlawful \n1 interference with his FMLA rights, under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601, et seq. (the FMLA). (D.I. 1). My \nEye Doctor moves for summary judgment on all these claims. (D.I. 33).1 \nA. Mr. Rodriguez's Employment with My Eye Doctor \nMy Eye Doctor is an eyecare practice with locations nationwide. (D.I. 35 at 105). At \nmost of its locations, staff members report to a general manager, the general manager reports to a \ndistrict manager, and the district manager reports to a regional manager. (Id.). Most locations are \nalso staffed with one or more eyewear consultants, who assist patients in trying on and selecting \nglasses and other eyewear. (Id.). \nMr. Rodriguez is a 56-year-old, non-white Hispanic gay man. (D.I. 1 at 2). He was hired \nin 2011 by My Eye Doctor's predecessor as a general manager at the Seaford, DE location. (D.I. \n35 at 21). After the acquisition, which took place in 2016 or 2017, Mr. Rodriguez became the \ngeneral manager at the Milford, DE location. (D.I. 40 at 44). His responsibilities were to \"run the \noffice\"---essentially, to supervise employees , attend to customers , and oversee the finances of the \noffice. (Id. at 42, 52). Christy Jones was the district manager, and Larry Wills was the regional \nmanager. (D.I. 33 at 2; D.I. 39 at 11). Mr. Rodriguez remained in this role until early 2019. (D.I. \n33 at 3; D.I. 40 at 45). \nWhile Mr. Rodriguez was at the Milford location, My Eye Doctor employed Michael \nRager as a business operations specialist. (D.I. 35 at 19; D.I. 40 at 88). Mr. Rager visited Mr. \nRodriguez's location approximately once a month to train employees and perform audits. (D.I. \n40 at 88, 171-72). During his visits, Mr. Rager repeatedly called Mr. Rodriguez by Hispanic \nnames other than his own (such as Hector, Pablo, and Jose), even though Mr. Rodriguez wore a \n1 I note that the evidentiary record is sparse. It contains only three depositions-those of Mr. \nRodriguez , (D.I. 40 at 35-130) and two former My Eye Doctor employees, Holly Porter, (D.I. 35 \nat 50-62), and Corey Seronick, (id. at 36-49)-and two affidavits. (Id. at 105-114, 190-191 \n(Kelly Hollis), 115-117 (Brandy Smith)). \n2 name tag and verbally corrected Mr. Rager numerous times. (D.I. 40 at 90, 176; D.I. 35 at 39-40, \n54, 61).2 On one occasion, while examining invoices in the presence of Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. \nJones, his district manager, Mr. Rager recited a list of Hispanic surnames and then asked whether \nMs. Jones noticed \"a trend\" with respect to patients given discounts. (D.I. 40 at 89). \nOn another occasion, while demonstrating to the Milford employees how to present \nglasses to a patient, Mr. Rager said, \"I know it's gay, but you just have to do it that way.\" (D.I. \n35 at 62; D.I. 40 at 100-101). Mr. Rager also made a comment about the Milford employees \nhaving recommended to him a \"gay restaurant \" at Rehoboth Beach (D.I. 35 at 55), and he \nperformed a \"limp wrist gay gesture\" while discussing the restaurant 's clientele. (D.I. 40 at 100). \nIn March 2017, Ms. Jones evaluated Mr. Rodriguez's performance during the 2016 year. \n(D.I. 35 at 124-29). Ms. Jones rated his \"Success Factors\" (e.g., percentage of sales goals met) \n2. 7 out of 5 (between \"Below Expectations \" and \"Satisfactory\") and rated most of his \"Core \nCompetencies\" (relating to performance skills) between 2 and 3 out of 5 (between \"Inconsistent \" \nand \"Meets Expectations\"). (Id.). Ms. Jones expressed some concerns about his performance ; for \nexample, she noted inconsistent responsiveness to patients, lack of communication to other staff \nmembers , and issues with meeting deadlines. (Id. at 128-29). \nIn June 2017, it was discovered that one of the staff members supervised by Mr. \nRodriguez conducted fraudulent transactions amounting to approximately $25,000 in funds \nstolen from My Eye Doctor. (D.I. 35 at 24). An investigation revealed that this incident occurred \nbecause Mr. Rodriguez had failed to check the transaction audit reports that were sent to his \nlocation daily, even though it was his responsibility to do so. (D.I. 40 at 51-52; D.I. 35 at 133). \nMr. Rager and Ms. Jones both participated in the investigation. (D.I. 35 at 133). Consequently , \n2 Mr. Rager visited the Georgetown office several times after Mr. Rodriguez moved there in \n2019, and he continued to refer to Mr. Rodriguez by Hispanic names other than Juan. (Id. at 96). \n3 several days later, My Eye Doctor sent Mr. Rodriguez a final written warning that threatened \n\"further disciplinary action up to and including termination of [Mr. Rodriguez 's] employment\" if \nMr. Rodriguez continued to fail to perform these job duties. (Id.). \nMs. Jones continued to note Mr. Rodriguez 's performance deficiencies, particularly with \nrespect to his lack of responsiveness to patient requests, and in late 2018 she helped to develop a \nPersonal Improvement Plan for Mr. Rodriguez. (Id. at 134-37). In January 2019, the regional \nmanager, Mr. Wills, met with Mr. Rodriguez and offered him the choice between a transfer to \nthe general manager position in Georgetown , DE or a demotion to an eyewear consultant at the \nGeorgetown location. (D.I. 40 at 45-47). Mr. Rodriguez took the latter option (id. at 46) and he \ntransitioned into the role on January 29, 2019 under general manager Calin Ropp.3 (Id. at 55, \n149). Brandy Smith, a non-Hispanic white woman under the age of 40 with no prior experience \nat My Eye Doctor and who did not submit a formal job application (id. at 143), was hired to take \nhis place as general manager of the Milford location. (Id. at 65-66, 120, 122-23). My Eye Doctor \nsubsequently promoted Ms. Smith to district manager after Ms. Jones resigned in June 2019. \n(D.I. 40 at 12-26; D.I. 35 at 115). \nAs an eyewear consultant, Mr. Rodriguez regularly met or exceeded his sales \nperformance goals. (D.I. 40 at 49). Three other eyewear consultants worked alongside him, as of \nearly 2020: Nadine Taube, Rhiannon Musca, and Brittany Straus. (D.I. 39 at 7; D.I. 35 at 156). \nMs. Taube, like Mr. Rodriguez , had been with the practice at least five years. (D.I. 40 at 125). \nMs. Taube is non-Hispanic and over 40 years old. (D.I. 35 at 116). Ms. Musca and Ms. Straus\u00ad\nboth in their early twenties-had less experience with My Eye Doctor. (D.I. 40 at 104-05, 120-\n21, 124-25). Mr. Rodriguez testified that both women regularly referred to him as an \"old man\" \n3 There is some disagreement as to spelling. I adopt Mr. Rodriguez's version as to not only Ms. \nRopp, but also as to Rhiannon Musca and Brittany Straus. \n4 and a \"dinosaur. \" (D.I. 40 at 82-84). Mr. Rodriguez also testified that he was excluded from \nmeetings regarding policy and procedure changes. (Id. at 82). \nB. FMLA Leave \nMy Eye Doctor contracts with Cigna as a third-party administrator for its FMLA \nAdministration . (D.I. 35 at 190). Under this agreement , Cigna unilaterally makes FMLA leave \ndetermination decisions for My Eye Doctor's employees . (Id.). \nIn July 2019, while working at the Georgetown location, Mr. Rodriguez was approved for \ncontinuous FMLA and short-term disability leave from May 28, 2019, through July 7, 2019, \n(D.I. 35 at 139-43), for dizziness, numbness in his hands and feet, and joint pain. (D.I. 40 at 72). \nIn early August 2019, Mr. Rodriguez applied for intermittent FMLA leave for July 31, 2019, \nthrough July 1, 2020 (D.I. 40 at 165-67). Cigna approved Mr. Rodriguez 's request, but because \nCigna's policy was only to approve intermittent FMLS leave in six-month increments , (D.I. 35 at \n190), Mr. Rodriguez received leave from July 31, 2019, through January 30, 2020. (Id. at 144-\n47). Mr. Rodriguez testified that he used his intermittent FMLA leave to attend medical \nappointments on Fridays, as that was when there were no doctors in the My Eye Doctor office. \n(D.I. 40 at 66). \nMy Eye Doctor provides a letter from Cigna, dated January 23, 2020, notifying Mr. \nRodriguez that his intermittent leave is set to expire on January 30th\u2022 (D.I. 35 at 148). My Eye \nDoctor also provides a letter from Cigna, dated May 29, 2020, indicating that Mr. Rodriguez \nmust provide additional information from his healthcare provider in order to extend his leave.4 \n4 My Eye Doctor says that the letter is in response to Mr. Rodriguez 's request to extend his \nintermittent FMLA leave beyond January 30, 2020. (D.I. 33 at 3-4). The letter, however, states \nthat Mr. Rodriguez requested to extend his leave \"to 01/30/2020\" (D.I. 35 at 258) and lists the \nrequested period of leave as \"07/31/2019-01/30/2020.\" (Id. at 260). The same letter indicates that \nMr. Rodriguez 's intermittent leave from July 31, 2019, to January 20, 2020, had already been \n5 (Id. at 258-64). Mr. Rodriguez , however, testified that it was never communicated to him that he \nhad exhausted his FMLA leave. (D.I. 40 at 75). \nAccording to Mr. Rodriguez , Ms. Smith-at that point the district manager-informed \nMr. Rodriguez 's general manager, Ms. Ropp, that Mr. Rodriguez could no longer take off on \nFridays because he was needed in the office. (Id. at 67). Ms. Ropp communicated this to Mr. \nRodriguez \"in the middle of 2019 and 2020.\"5 (Id. at 68). Mr. Rodriguez testified that he tried to \nspeak to Ms. Smith about his FMLA leave just prior to the COVID-19 shutdown , and that she \nsaid in response, \"We just need you in the office.\" (Id. at 69-70.) Ms. Smith denies telling Mr. \nRodriguez that he could no longer take his FMLA leave. (D.I. 35 at 116). She does, however, \nrecall speaking with him in March 2020 about the possibility that Mr. Rodriguez was \"abusing\" \nhis FMLA leave, as he had begun calling out of work in the mornings (rather than doing so \nahead of time) and declining to supply explanations or documentation for his absences aside \nfrom saying, \"it is for my FMLA.\" (Id.). \nC. The COVID-19 Pandemic and Mr. Rodriguez's Termination \nAt the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic , My Eye Doctor partially closed its \noffices. Several employees-Ms . Straus, Ms. Musca, and Ms. Ropp, but not Mr. Rodriguez , who \nwas not working-came in only a few days a week. (D.I. 40 at 54-55). Then, on March 19, 2020, \nMy Eye Doctor announced that it would close all its offices from March 23, 2020, through April \n3, 2020, and furloughed all its employees. (D.I. 35 at 106). My Eye Doctor continued to pay its \nemployees during this period. (Id. at 106-07). My Eye Doctor stopped paying Mr. Rodriguez \nafter the two-week furlough, at which point he went on unemployment . (D.I. 40 at 77). \napproved . (Id. at 258). Whether or not Cigna's description of the requested leave period contains \na typo, it is apparent that Cigna required additional information from Mr. Rodriguez before \nextending his leave beyond January 30, 2020. \n5 I can only guess what date this is supposed to mean. \n6 As the pandemic progressed , My Eye Doctor's patient volume and company revenue \nsignificantly decreased. (D.I. 35 at 107). My Eye Doctor determined that it could longer support \nits pre-pandemic staffing model, and, on June 23, 2020, it implemented a reduction in force \n(\"RIF\"). (Id.). As a result of the RIF, three hundred eighty-eight employees were terminated \nnationwide, including twenty-three eyewear consultants in Mr. Rodriguez 's region. (Id.). Mr. \nRodriguez was in this group. (Id.). The relevant decisionmakers were Mr. Wills and possibly also \nMs. Jones (id. at 31-32),6 and Mr. Rodriguez 's performance deficiencies were taken into \nconsideration (id. at 23; see also id. at 159-69).7 My Eye Doctor also terminated Ms. Taube, as \nwell as Colleen Beyer, a non-Hispanic woman above the age of 40 who worked as an optometric \ntechnician at the Seaford and Georgetown locations. (Id. at 108; D.I. 40 at 59, 105). Ms. Straus \nand Ms. Musca were not terminated ; both returned to work following the two-week furlough. \n(D.I. 40 at 104-05). \nMr. Rodriguez 's termination letter stated that he would not be recalled from the furlough, \nand it described his position as eliminated. (D.I. 40 at 141). Approximately 3 weeks later, My \nEye Doctor posted an employment ad for an eyewear consultant at the Georgetown location (id. \nat 142), and it subsequently hired Daryan Johnson and Kate Compton for that role.8 (D.I. 40 at \n154). Ms. Johnson and Ms. Compton are white, non-Hispanic, and under the age of 40. (Id. at \n154, 188-89; D.I. 35 at 179). \n6 Per My Eye Doctor's discovery responses, the following individuals were \"involved in the \ninvestigation of the incidents leading to [Mr. Rodriguez 's] termination\" and have \"knowledge of \nhis performance issues\": Mr. Wills, Ms. Smith, Ms. Hollis, Ms. Ropp, and Ms. Jones. (D.I. 35 at \n25-26). \n7 My Eye Doctor provides a spreadsheet of employees who were included in the RIF. (D.I. 35 at \n159-69). The spreadsheet lists Mr. Rodriguez and notes that he has \"performance issues.\" (Id. at \n166). The same note accompanies Ms. Taube's name, but not that of Ms. Musca or Ms. Straus. \n(Id.). \n8 My Eye Doctor states that Ms. Johnson was hired to fill a position posted in September 2020. \n(D.I. 35 at 179). \n7 II. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. \nCrv. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely \ndisputed material fact relative to the claims in question. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, \n330 (1986). Material facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding, and \"a \ndispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury \nto return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. \n2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of \nevidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \nThe burden then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue \nfor trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); \nWilliams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). A non-moving \nparty asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents , electronically stored \ninformation , affidavits or declarations , stipulations ... , admissions , interrogatory answers, or \nother materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the opposing party] do not establish \nthe absence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(l). \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable \ninferences in that party's favor. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Wishldn v. Potter, 476 \nF.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). A dispute is \"genuine\" only if the evidence is such that a \n8 reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49. \nIf the non-moving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case \nwith respect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter oflaw. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Sex, Sexual Orientation, Race, National Origin, and Age Discrimination \nClaims \nMr. Rodriguez alleges that My Eye Doctor's \"refusal to rehire or bring Mr. Rodriguez \nback to work in June 2020\" (D.I. 39 at 10) constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis of \nsex, sexual orientation, race, national origin, and age. (D.I. 1 at 2, 8). \nTitle VII discrimination claims are governed by the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting \nframework. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973). Employment \ndiscrimination claims under\u00a7 1981 and Title VII have the same elements. Anderson v. Wachovia \nMortg. Corp., 621 F.3d 261, 267-68 (3d Cir. 2010). So do DDEA claims. Wagenhoffer v. \nVisionquest Nat'! Ltd., 2016 WL 3947952, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. July 14, 2016) (\"The DDEA's \nlanguage 'is substantially the same as' Title VII's, and Delaware courts have repeatedly held that \ncase law interpreting Title VII is relevant to any state law discrimination claim.\"). So do age \ndiscrimination claims under the ADEA. Smith v. City of Allentown, 589 F.3d 684, 689 (3d Cir. \n2009). \nFirst, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of the complained-of discrimination \nor retaliation. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802. The Third Circuit has held that \"to \nestablish a prima facie claim of discrimination, a plaintiff must show that: 1) he is a member of a \nprotected class; 2) he was qualified for the position he sought to attain or retain; 3) he suffered an \nadverse employment action; and 4) the action occurred under circumstances that could give rise \n9 ' to an inference of intentional discrimination. \" Vaughan v. Boeing Co., 733 F. App'x 617, 622 \n(3d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up). \nOnce a prima facie case has been established , the burden shifts to the employer to \narticulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the alleged adverse employment action. \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-03. At this stage, a defendant need not prove that the \narticulated reason actually motivated the adverse employment action; a defendant need only \narticulate any legitimate reason for the discharge . See Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., 109 F.3d 913, \n920 n. 2 (3d Cir. 1997) (noting that the defendant 's burden to proffer a non-discriminatory \nrationale is \"relatively light\"). \nAfter the employer proffers a reason for the action, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to \nestablish that the employer's articulated rationale is pretext. Id. at 804. \"To avoid summary \njudgment, the plaintiff's evidence rebutting the employer's proffered legitimate reasons must \nallow a factfinder reasonably to infer that each of the employer's proffered non-discriminatory \nreasons was either a post hoc fabrication or otherwise did not actually motivate the employment \naction.\" Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994) (cleaned up). \"(T]he plaintiff must \npoint to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably either \n(1) disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious \ndiscriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the \nemployer's action.\" Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764. This two-pronged disjunctive test is known as the \nFuentes test. \nMr. Rodriguez specifies in his opposition brief that the relevant adverse employment \naction is My Eye Doctor's \"refusal to rehire or bring Mr. Rodriguez back to work in June 2020,\" \n(D.I. 39 at 10), rather than his termination , as is alleged in the complaint. (D.I. 1 at 8). 1. Sex \nAs My Eye Doctor notes (D.I. 42 at 7 n. 4), Mr. Rodriguez 's complaint does not make it \nclear that he brings a sex discrimination claim. Sex discrimination is not mentioned in Count I, \nwhich contains Mr. Rodriguez 's Title VII claims (D.I. 1 at 8-9), nor is it mentioned in any of the \nother Counts in the complaint (id. at 9-13). Although the Counts make no mention of national \norigin discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination either (id. at 8-13), the parties have \nbriefed these two claims on the merits (e.g., D.I. 34 at 7 n. 8, 7-12; D.I. 39 at 9-15). I therefore \nconsider those arguments here. See FED. R. CIV. P. 8(e) (\"Pleadings must be construed as to do \njustice\"). By contrast, My Eye Doctor discusses sex discrimination in its reply brief only. (D.I. \n42 at 7). A reply brief is not the proper place to first challenge a claim on summary judgment. I \ntherefore DENY Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the sex discrimination issue. \n2. Sexual Orientation \nMy Eye Doctor does not dispute that Mr. Rodriguez has met the first three elements of a \nprima facie claim of sexual orientation discrimination. Therefore , the only question remaining is \nwhether the circumstances surrounding My Eye Doctor's failure to bring back Mr. Rodriguez \ngives rise to an inference of sexual orientation discrimination. I conclude that they do not. \nA plaintiff may satisfy the fourth element by presenting evidence that similarly situated \nemployees, outside of the protected class, were treated more favorably. See Mandel v. M & Q \nPackaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 170 (3d Cir. 2013). The Third Circuit has stated that the fact \nthat a plaintiff was replaced by someone outside his protected class is sufficient to establish an \ninference of discrimination . Johnson v. Keebler-Sunshine Biscuits, Inc., 214 F. App'x 239, 242 \n(3d Cir. 2007); Maynard v. Goodwill Indus. of Delaware, 678 F. Supp. 2d 243, 253 (D. Del. \n2010). A plaintiff may also support an inference of discrimination with non-comparator \n11 evidence , \"including , but not limited to ... evidence of similar [ sexual orientation] discrimination \nof other employees, or direct evidence of discrimination from some statements or actions by [his] \nsupervisors suggesting . . . animus\" based on the protected class. Golod v. Bank of America \nCorp., 403 F. App'x 699, 702 n. 2 (3d Cir. 2010); Arku-Nyadia v. Legal Sea Foods, LLC, 2020 \nWL 6111001, at *3 (D.N.J. Oct. 16, 2020). \nMy Eye Doctor argues that Mr. Rodriguez 's prima facie case fails because he has not \ndemonstrated that heterosexual employees were treated more favorably. (D.I. 33 at 9; D.I. 42 at \n11 ). Indeed, Mr. Rodriguez has not offered evidence, nor has he argued, that any of the My Eye \nDoctor employees he presents as comparators (such as Ms. Compton or Ms. Johnson) are \nheterosexual. An absence of comparator evidence does not end the matter, however. Mr. \nRodriguez is not required to present comparator evidence to support an inference of \ndiscrimination . \"Such an inference can be supported [by] ... direct evidence of discrimination \nfrom some statements or actions by [his] supervisor s suggesting . . . animus\" based on sexual \norientation. Golod, 403 Fed. App'x at 702 n. 2. \nMr. Rodriguez attempts to invoke this avenue by highlighting two remarks that Mr. \nRager made while visiting the Milford office: (1) while demonstrating a new method to display \neyeglasses , Mr. Rager disparagingly referred to the method as \"gay\"; and (2) while discussing a \nrestaurant at Rehoboth beach that other employees had recommended , Mr. Rager \"made a limp \nwrist gesture and stated that he did not know so many 'people' were there.\" (D.I. 39 at 5). These \ncomments, although inappropriate and grounds for discipline , are not enough to support an \ninference of discrimination here. \n\"Stray remarks by non-decisionmakers or by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision \nprocess are rarely given great weight, particularl y if they were made temporally remote from the \n12 date of decision.\" Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr, & Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 545 (3d Cir. \n1992). Indeed, \"discriminatory statements ... made by non-decision-makers or individuals who \nplayed no part in the decision are inadequate to support an inference of discrimination.\" Foster v. \nNew Castle Area Sch. Dist., 98 F. App'x. 85, 87 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Gomez v. Allegheny \nHealth Servs., Inc., 71 F.3d 1079, 1085 (3d Cir.1995)). Although \"it is sufficient if those \nexhibiting discriminatory animus influenced or participated in the decision to terminate,\" \nAbramson v. William Patterson College of New Jersey, 260 F.3d 265 (3d Cir. 2001), no evidence \nin the record suggests that Mr. Rager played a part in the ultimate decision. Rather, the record \nsuggests that the only individuals with input were Mr. Wills, the regional manager, and possibly \nalso Ms. Jones, who was the district manager until June 2019. (D.I. 35 at 31-32). Nor is there \nevidence that Mr. Rager made these statements in temporal proximity to the RIF. Consequently, \nI do not think that these remarks from Mr. Rager adequately support an inference of \ndiscrimination. \nAs Mr. Rager's remarks are the only direct evidence of animus that Mr. Rodriguez \npresents, I agree with My Eye Doctor that Mr. Rodriguez has failed to make a prima facie case \nof sexual orientation discrimination. I therefore GRANT My Eye Doctor's motion for summary \njudgment as to this claim. \n3. Race/National Origin \na. Prima Facie Case \nMy Eye Doctor does not dispute that Mr. Rodriguez has met the first three elements of a \nprirna facie claim of race and national origin discrimination. Thus, again, the sole question is \nwhether Mr. Rodriguez has met his burden of establishing that My Eye Doctor's failure to bring \nhim back occurred under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination. This \n13 time, Mr. Rodriguez has established a prima facie case. The parties agree that Mr. Rodriguez \nwas replaced by Ms. Compton and Ms. Johnson, neither of whom are Hispanic. This is sufficient \nto establish an inference of discrimination. Keebler-Sunshine Biscuits, 214 F. App'x at 242. \nb. Non-Discriminatory Rationale \nMy Eye Doctor has met its burden of production by proffering two legitimate non\u00ad\ndiscriminatory reasons for declining to bring back or rehire Mr. Rodriguez: My Eye Doctor's \ndecision to downsize because of the COVID-19 pandemic , as well as Mr. Rodriguez 's \nperformance issues. (D.I. 42 at 2). \nMr. Rodriguez challenges these rationales as insufficient. With respect to the first \nrationale, he argues that, because the relevant adverse employment action is My Eye Doctor's \ndecision not to rehire him (rather than its decision to terminate him), My Eye Doctor cannot rely \non the initial COVID-19 RIF. (D.I. 39 at 14). My Eye Doctor, however, has stated that its \ndecision to downsize also drove its decision not to rehire Mr. Rodriguez . (D.I. 42 at 2). I \ntherefore find the first rationale to be a legitimate one. \nWith respect to the second rationale, Mr. Rodriguez argues that My Eye Doctor cannot \nlegitimately rely on performance issues, as Mr. Rodriguez did not have any documented \nperformance issues at Georgetown (and, indeed, performed well there). (D.I. 39 at 14). But My \nEye Doctor has produced documentation of longstanding concerns with Mr. Rodriguez 's \nperformance: a weak performance evaluation (D.I. 35 at 124-29), a final written warning (id at \n133), evidence of a performance improvement plan (id. at 134-37), and a spreadsheet noting Mr. \nRodriguez's \"performance issues\" that was prepared contemporaneously with My Eye Doctor's \ndecision not to rehire Mr. Rodriguez (id. at 166). The Third Circuit has held that unsatisfactory \nwork performance constitutes a legitimate , non-discriminatory basis for adverse employment \n14 actions. See, e.g., Parson v. Vanguard Group, 702 F. App'x 63, 67-68 (3d Cir. 2017). \nAccordingly , My Eye Doctor has satisfied its burden here. \nc. Pretext \nAs My Eye Doctor has met its burden of production , to survive summary judgment , Mr. \nRodriguez must produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that My Eye \nDoctor's proffered reasons are pretextual. I conclude that Mr. Rodriguez has not met this burden. \nMr. Rodriguez presents evidence directed at both prongs of the Fuentes test. I examine \nhis arguments in turn. \n1. Prong One \nUnder prong one, the plaintiff must point to \"weaknesses , implausibilities , \ninconsistencies , incoherencies , or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons \n[such] that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them 'unworthy of credence\"' and hence \ninfer that the proffered nondiscriminatory reason \"did not actually motivate\" the employer's \naction. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764-65. In other words, \"a plaintiff may satisfy this standard by \ndemonstrating , through admissible evidence, that the employer 's articulated reason was not \nmerely wrong, but that it was so plainly wrong that it cannot have been the employer's real \nreason.\" Jones v. School Dist. Of Philadelphia , 198 F.3d 403,413 (3d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up). \nMr. Rodriguez contends that the termination letter he received shows that My Eye \nDoctor's proffered rationales are \"inconsistent and unbelievable. \" (D.I. 39 at 14-15). Mr. \nRodriguez points out that the letter did not cite any performance deficiencies and stated that he \nwas a valued employee. (Id.). Such generic language is to be expected of a form letter, however, \nand, as My Eye Doctor asserts in its reply, Mr. Rodriguez 's letter was \"the standard COVID-19 \nRIF form letter\" sent to hundreds of terminated employees. (D.I. 42 at 4). \n15 This helps to explain the second apparent inconsistency that Mr. Rodriguez identifies: the \nfact that the letter \"falsely\" claimed that his position was being eliminated when, in fact, that \nposition was posted a few weeks after his termination . (Id. at 14). The full \"claim\" in the letter is \nas follows: \"Your medical, dental, and vision benefits, if applicable , will continue through the \nend of the month in which your position was eliminated (through June 30, 2020).\" (D.I. 35 at \n158). This, too, is vague language typical of a form letter; it is unclear whether \"your position\" \nrefers to eyewear consultants in general, or Mr. Rodriguez 's position as an eyewear consultant, \nspecifically. In any event, the purpose of that passage was not to convey the reason for \ntermination , but rather, to communicate the remaining duration of the terminated employees ' \nhealth benefits. Where the letter does address a reason for the termination , it specifies that My \nEye Doctor's decision is \"[ d]ue to the unforeseen circumstances surrounding COVID-19 and the \nneed to adjust our business accordingly. \" (Id.). This is exactly the rationale that My Eye Doctor \nhas proffered here.9 Consequently , I agree with My Eye Doctor that Mr. Rodriguez 's termination \nletter is not suggestive of pretext. \nii. Prong Two \nUnder prong two, a plaintiff must show that an employer 's discriminatory reason was \nmore likely than not a motivating cause of the employer's action. Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 764. To do \nso, a plaintiff may, for example, show that an employer has previously discriminated against \nhim, that the etnployer has previously discriminated against other persons within the protected \nclass, or that the employer has treated other similarly situated employees not within the protected \n9 As for the posting of the eyewear consultant position, I am not convinced that its timing (three \nweeks after Mr. Rodriguez was terminated) significantly undermines this rationale. My Eye \nDoctor presents evidence that it hired Ms. Compton because it had recently taken on a new \noptometrist. (D.I. 43 at 1-2). As My Eye Doctor notes in its reply (D.I. 42 at 4), the early months \nof the pandemic presented rapidly changing circumstances to which businesses tried-and \nsometimes struggled-to adapt. \n16 class more favorably . Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765; Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, Div. of Sterling, Inc., \n142 F.3d 639,645 (3d Cir. 1998). \nMr. Rodriguez asserts that Mr. Rager's comments towards Mr. Rodriguez are evidence of \ndiscrimination . (D.I. 39 at 10-11). He points to multiple occasions on which Mr. Rager\u00ad\nseemingly intentionally-referred to Mr. Rodriguez by Hispanic names other than his own, as \nwell as the incident in which Mr. Rager intimated that the Milford office gave Hispanic patients \npreferential treatment with respect to discounts. (Id. at 4-5). This behavior might reflect \ndiscriminatory animus on the part of Mr. Rager, but as discussed , no evidence in the record \nsuggests that Mr. Rager took part in the ultimate decision not to bring back Mr. Rodriguez . Mr. \nRodriguez has also failed to show that these incidents occurred in temporal proximity to the \ndecision. Generally, discriminatory remarks by non-decisionrnakers are entitled to less weight, \nespecially where the plaintiff does not establish that the remarks came close to the decision date. \nEzold, 983 F.2d at 545. I decline to depart from this principle here. \nMr. Rodriguez also suggests that My Eye Doctor treated white, non-Hispanic employees \nmore favorably than Mr. Rodriguez. (D.I. 39 at 2). \"To make a comparison of plaintiff's \ntreatment to that of an employee outside plaintiffs protected class for purposes of a Title VII \nclaim, the plaintiff must show that she and the employee are similarly situated in all relevant \nrespects.\" Smith v. Walgreen Co., 964 F. Supp. 2d 338, 349 (D. Del. 2013) (cleaned up). \n\"Whether a factor is relevant for purposes of a similarly situated analysis must be determined by \nthe context of each case.\" Id. (cleaned up). Mr. Rodriguez identifies Ms. Musca and Ms. Straus, \nboth eyewear consultants at the Georgetown office, who were brought back in June 2020 when \nMr. Rodriguez was not. (D.I. 39 at 2). But no evidence in the record suggests that these two \nemployees were outside Mr. Rodriguez 's protected class (i.e., non-Hispanic) ; all Mr. Rodriguez \n17 provides is a bare assertion to that effect in his opposition brief. (D.I. 39 at 12). This 1s \ninsufficient. Thus, Ms. Musca and Ms. Straus are not valid comparators here. \nMr. Rodriguez next points to his replacements: Ms. Compton and Ms. Johnson, who My \nEye Doctor hired to fill eyewear consultant positions after Mr. Rodriguez was terminated (id. at \n14-15), as well as Ms. Smith, who My Eye Doctor hired to take Mr. Rodriguez 's place as general \nmanager of the Milford office after he relocated. (Id. at 11 ). This time, the evidence of record \nreflects that all three of these women are white and non-Hispanic. (D.I. 35 at 120-21, 179; D.I. \n40 at 122-23). For the reasons discussed below, however, I conclude that no reasonable jury \ncould find that the circumstances of these replacements raise a reasonable inference of \ndiscrimination. \nAlthough the hiring of someone not in the protected class as a replacement is enough to \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination at the prima facie stage, Keebler-Sunshine \nBiscuits, 214 F. App'x at 242, something more is required here. Mr. Rodriguez must \"point to \nevidence with sufficient probative force that a factfinder could conclude by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that [race or national origin] was a motivating or determinative factor in the \nemployment decision.\" Simpson, 143 F.3d at 644-45. The fact that Mr. Rodriguez 's replacements \nwere outside his protected classes, standing alone, is not sufficiently probative. The additional \nevidence that Mr. Rodriguez presents is unconvincing. He asserts in his opposition brief that Ms. \nMusca and Ms. Straus have \"far less experience than [Mr. Rodriguez] as [ eyewear consultants] ,\" \n(D.I. 39 at 10), but this assertion is unsupported by his citations to the record. He argues that the \nsame is true of Ms. Smith (id. at 6), but that argument is belied by evidence that My Eye Doctor \n18 has presented that, at the time she was hired, Ms. Smith had \"extensive leadership and training \nexperience , of which the last five years has been in the optical industry.\"10 (D.I. 35 at 138). \nFinally, Mr. Rodriguez argues that \"while working at the Georgetown location, [he] was \nregularly excluded from meetings regarding policy and procedure changes while the \nCaucasian, younger, female employees were kept up to date about changes.\" (D.I. 39 at 7). No \nevidence in the record suggests that these incidents occurred as a result of racial animus, and Mr. \nRodriguez does not tie these incidents to My Eye Doctor's decision not to rehire him. Rather, he \ntestifies that the individuals who excluded him were Ms. Ropp, Ms. Musca, and Ms. Straus (D.I. \n40 at 86), none of whom are among the individuals who My Eye Doctor testified had input into \nthe ultimate decision (D.I. 35 at 31-32). \nFor the reasons stated above, I find that none of these arguments , singularly or \ncollectively , is enough to carry Mr. Rodriguez 's burden on the question of pretext for his race \nand national origin discrimination claims. I therefore GRANT My Eye Doctor's motion for \nsummary judgment as to these claims. \n4. Age \na. Prima Facie Case \nTo establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA, a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate that \"[he] (1) was a member of a protected class, i.e., that [he] was over forty, (2) is \nqualified for the position, (3) suffered an adverse employment decision, ( 4) and was ultimately \nreplaced by a person sufficiently younger to permit an inference of age discrimination. \" Duffy v. \nPaper Magic Grp., 265 F.3d 163, 167 (3d Cir. 2001). My Eye Doctor does not dispute that Mr. \n10 I doubt that Ms. Smith is particularly relevant for the additional reason that there is no claim of \ndiscrimination in relation to the demotion that created the vacancy. \n19 Rodriguez has established all four elements. I therefore proceed to the next step m the \nframework. \nb. Non-Discriminatory Rationale \nThe rationales that My Eye Doctor proffers are the same as those it proffered for the other \ndiscrimination claims discussed above. (See, e.g., D.I. 42 at 2). Mr. Rodriguez 's challenges to \nthose rationales are also the same. (See D.I. 39 at 14). I therefore conclude , for the same reasons \nas before, that My Eye Doctor has satisfied its burden of production here. \nc. Pretext \nThe evidence that Mr. Rodriguez offers as support for pretext is yet again directed at both \nprongs of the Fuentes test. Mr. Rodriguez 's evidence and arguments directed at prong one, \nhowever, are identical to those he raised with respect to the discrimination claims already \ndiscussed . (See D.I. 39 at 14-15). I similarly reject them here. I therefore focus my analysis on \nthe arguments that are directed at prong two. \nMr. Rodriguez points to his testimony that Ms. Musca and Ms. Straus, who were his \ncoworkers at the Georgetown location, repeatedl y referred to him as an \"old man\" and a \n\"dinosaur.\" (D.I. 39 at 12). But Mr. Rodriguez does not dispute My Eye Doctor's evidence that \nMs. Musca and Ms. Straus took no part in its decision not to bring back Mr. Rodriguez. (D.I. 35 \nat 31-32). Their comments , therefore , are of little weight here. See Ezold, 983 F.2d at 545. \nMr. Rodriguez also argues that My Eye Doctor treated younger employees more \nfavorably. (See D.I. 39 at 6-7, 10). He identifies Ms. Musca and Ms. Straus-both of whom were \nsignificantly under 40 years old (D.I. 40 at 120-121)-as comparators , arguing they received \npreferential treatment because My Eye Doctor brought them back to work, but not Mr. \nRodriguez . (D.I. 39 at 10). Mr. Rodriguez also points to the fact that Ms. Taube, the only other \n20 eyewear consultant at the Georgetown location who was over the age of 40, was not brought \nback either. (Id). The trouble with Mr. Rodriguez 's argument is that neither Ms. Musca nor Ms. \nStraus are \"similarly situated in all relevant respects,\" as is required for such comparisons for \nTitle VII purposes. Walgreen Co., 964 F. Supp. 2d at 349. Mr. Rodriguez has offered no \nevidence that either Ms. Musca or Ms. Straus demonstrated performance deficiencies while \nemployed at My Eye Doctor; My Eye Doctor, however, has proffered a spreadsheet noting \nperformance deficiencies for Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. Taube, but not for Ms. Musca or Ms. \nStraus. (D.I. 35 at 166). \nMr. Rodriguez next contends that the fact that My Eye Doctor replaced him with younger \nemployees (Ms. Smith, Ms. Compton , and Ms. Johnson) is evidence of pretext. (D.I. 39 at 11, \n15). Replacement with a younger person, without more, is insufficient to create a genuine issue \nof material fact. See Pottenger v. Potlatch Corp., 329 F.3d 740, 748 (9th Cir. 2003) (\"Without \nmore ... the fact that [the replacement] was younger than [the terminated employee] does not \ncreate a triable issue of pretext.\"); Dunaway v. Int'! Bhd a/Teamsters , 310 F.3d 758, 767 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (\"The ... decision to replace her with a younger woman is insufficient for a jury to \nconclude that she lost out because of her age.\") ( cleaned up). Mr. Rodriguez 's assertions that his \nreplacements were comparatively inexperienced (D.I. 39 at 6, 10) are, as previously explained , \ninsufficient. \nConsequently , for the reasons stated above, Mr. Rodriguez does not carry his burden on \nthe question of pretext for his age discrimination claim. I therefore GRANT My Eye Doctor's \nmotion for summary judgment as to this claim. \nB. FMLA Claims \nThe Third Circuit has stated that, \n21 When employees invoke rights granted under the FMLA, employers may not \"interfere \nwith, restrain, or deny the exercise of or attempt to exercise\" these rights. Nor may \nemployers \"discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for \nopposing any practice made unlawful.\" The former provision is generally , if imperfectly , \nreferred to as \"interference\" whereas the latter is often referred to as \"retaliation. \" \nLichtenstein v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 691 F.3d 294, 301 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(internal citations omitted). Mr. Rodriguez claims that My Eye Doctor unlawfully interfered with \nhis rights under the FMLA by requiring him to be in the office every day, rather than continuing \nto allow him to take Fridays off. (See D.I. 1 at 10-11; D.I. 39 at 16-17). Mr. Rodriguez also \nclaims that My Eye Doctor's refusal to bring him back to work constituted retaliation against \nhim for exercising his FMLA rights. (D.I. 1 at 10-11; D.I. 39 at 16-17). \n1. Interference \nTo make a claim of interference under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show: \n(1) he or she was an eligible employee under the FMLA; (2) the defendant was an \nemployer subject to the FMLA's requirements; (3) the plaintiff was entitled to FMLA \nleave; ( 4) the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of his or her intention to take FMLA \nleave; and (5) the plaintiff was denied benefits to which he or she was entitled under the \nFMLA. \nRoss v. Gilhuly, 755 F.3d 185, 191-92 (3d Cir. 2014). \"[F]or an interference claim to be viable, \nthe plaintiff must show that FMLA benefits were actually withheld. \" Id. at 192 ( citation \nomitted). Even if plaintiff makes this showing, the FMLA \"provides \u00b7no relief unless the \nemployee has been prejudiced by the violation[.]\" Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 \nU.S. 81, 89 (2002); Watson v. Drexel University , 2021 WL 4429826, at *4 (3d Cir. 2021) \n(affirming grant of summary judgment to defendant on FMLA interference claim because \nplaintiff failed to show prejudice as a result of defendant 's violation) . \nMy Eye Doctor argues that Mr. Rodriguez has failed to present evidence that \"he \ncontinued to be an eligible employee after January 30, 2020\" (prong 1 ), \"he was entitled to \n22 FMLA leave after January 30, 2020\" (prong 3), or \"he gave notice to [My Eye Doctor] of an \nintention to continue FMLA leave after January 30, 2020\" (prong 4). (D.I. 33 at 16-17). All three \nof these arguments turn on the January 30, 2020 expiration date of Mr. Rodriguez 's intermittent \nFMLA leave. (D.I. 35 at 148). It is unclear from the record, however, when the alleged \ninterference took place. Mr. Rodriguez testified that Ms. Ropp, his general manager, told him to \nstop taking his intermittent FMLA leave \"in the middle of 2019 and 2020.\" (D.I. 40 at 67, 70-\n71). With respect to the period prior to January 30, 2020, My Eye Doctor has neither proved (nor \neven argued) the absence of a material fact relative to these elements of Mr. Rodriguez 's \ninterference claim. \nNext, My Eye Doctor contends that Mr. Rodriguez has not shown \"that [My Eye Doctor] \ninterfered with his FMLA rights.\" (D.I. 33 at 17). The record reflects that Ms. Ropp advised Mr. \nRodriguez that he could no longer take Fridays off for his medical treatment (D.I. 40 at 67-68), \nand the parties dispute whether Ms. Smith instructed him to make himself available on all \nworkdays. (Id. at 69; D.I. 35 at 116). I therefore find that an issue of material issue of fact exists \nas to whether the alleged conduct by Ms. Smith and Ms. Ropp constitute interference . \nFinally, My Eye Doctor argues that Mr. Rodriguez has not shown that \"that he ~as \nprejudiced by the alleged interference \" (D.I. 33 at 17-18) as Mr. Rodriguez testified that shortly \nafter his conversation with Ms. Smith, My Eye Doctor closed its offices as a result of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic (D.I. 40 at 70). My Eye Doctor's argument , as I understand it, is that even \nif My Eye Doctor wrongly withheld Mr. Rodriguez 's entitlement to take FMLA leave, Mr. \nRodriguez had no opportunity to experience prejudice given the timing of the office closures. \nMr. Rodriguez also testified, however, that he did not take FMLA leave after Ms. Ropp told him \nto stop doing so \"in the middle of 2019 and 2020.\" (D.I. 40 at 67). My Eye Doctor says nothing \n23 about whether a reasonable jury could find that the alleged interference prejudiced Mr. \nRodriguez during this period. I therefore find that a material issue of fact exists as to prejudice. \nFor the foregoing reasons, I DENY My Eye Doctor's motion for summary judgment as to \nMr. Rodriguez 's FMLA interference claim. \n2. Retaliation \nTo prevail on an FMLA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that \"(1) [he] invoked \n[his] right to FMLA-qualifying leave, (2) [he] suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) \nthe adverse action was causally related to [his] invocation of rights.\" Lichtenst ein, 691 F.3d at \n301-02. If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of those factors, the usual McDonnell \nDouglas burden-shifting framework is implicated ; the employer must \"articulate some \nlegitimate , nonretaliatory reason for its decision,\" id., after which the burden shifts to the \nplaintiff to prove pretext. Id. \nMy Eye Doctor argues that Mr. Rodriguez cannot make a prima facie case of retaliation , \nbecause he cannot prove that his termination was causally related to the fact that he took FMLA \nleave. (D.I. 33 at 18). Mr. Rodriguez replies that My Eye Doctor's refusal to bring him back to \nwork while bringing back other employees who did not take FMLA leave, in combination with \nthe alleged statements by Ms. Smith forbidding Mr. Rodriguez from taking FMLA leave, is \nsufficient to prove causation. (D.I. 39 at 18-19). I conclude that Mr. Rodriguez does not establish \nthe necessary connection to substantiate his prima facie case. \nUnder Third Circuit law, to establish causation for a retaliation claim, \"a plaintiff usually \nmust prove either (1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity \nand the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to \nestablish a causal link.\" Lauren W ex. rel. Jean W v. DeF!aminis , 480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. \n24 2007). In the absence of that proof, the plaintiff must show that from the \"evidence gleaned from \nthe record as a whole\" the trier of the fact should infer causation . Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers \nCo., 206 F.3d 271,281 (3d Cir. 2000). \nMr. Rodriguez presents no \"pattern of antagonism \" evidence, nor has he argued the \nexistence of \"unduly suggestive \" temporal proximity . Mr. Rodriguez does not point to any other \ncircumstantial evidence sufficient to support a causal link finding. His reliance on Ms. Smith's \nstatements is unavailing . Ms. Smith was not a decision-maker concerning the decision to \nterminate plaintiff. (D .I. 3 5 at 31-3 2). Ms. Ropp, the general manager at the Georgetown office \nwho Mr. Rodriguez alleges relayed a message from Ms. Smith forbidding him from taking \nFMLA leave (D.I. 40 at 68), was not a decision-maker either. (D.I. 35 at 31-32). As Mr. \nRodriguez does not dispute this evidence, I do not believe that a reasonable jury could infer a \ncausal link from the statements of Ms. Smith ( or those of Ms. Ropp). \nNeither am I convinced by Mr. Rodriguez 's argument that causation can be inferred from \nthe fact that My Eye Doctor \"brought other employees back who did not have FMLA issues.\" \n(D.I. 39 at 19). It is unclear who these other employees are, as Mr. Rodriguez does not \naccompany his point with any citations to the record. In fact, he fails to identify in either the \ncomplaint or his answering brief any employees who did not take FMLA leave who were \nbrought back. This is insufficient. \nAccordingly , I conclude that Mr. Rodriguez has failed to make a prima facie case of \nFMLA retaliation . I therefore GRANT My Eye Doctor's motion for summary judgment as to this \nclaim. \n25 C. ADA Claims \n1. Disability Discrimination \nA disparate treatment claim under the ADA operates under the burden-shifting \nframework of McDonnell Douglas. See Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Se. Pennsylvania , 168 \nF.3d 661, 667-668 (3d Cir. 1999). \na. Prima Facie Case \nIn order to make a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a \nplaintiff must frrst establish that he: (1) has a disability ; (2) is a qualified individual; and (3) has \nsuffered an adverse employment decision because of that disability. Turner v. Hershey Chocolate \nUS., 440 F.3d 604,611 (3d Cir 2006). To satisfy the third element, a plaintiff must show that his \ndisability was a \"determinative factor\" in the employer's decision to take the adverse \nemployment action. Fiorentini v. William Penn Sch. Dist., 666 Fed. App'x 229, 294 (3d Cir. \n2016). \nHere, My Eye Doctor does not contest that Mr. Rodriguez is a qualified individual with a \ndisability. (D.I. 33 at 14). My Eye Doctor's failure to rehire or bring back Mr. Rodriguez \nconstitutes an adverse employment action. Although My Eye Doctor asserts that Mr. Rodriguez \nfails to establish a causal link between his purported disability and his termination, My Eye \nDoctor doesn't provide any argument on this point. (Id. at 15, D.I. 42 at 7-8). I therefore move to \nthe next step of the framework. \nb. Non-Discriminatory Rationale \nMy Eye Doctor proffers the same rationales as before. (See, e.g., D.I. 42 at 8). Mr. \nRodriguez 's challenges to those rationales are also the same. (See D.I. 39 at 14). Thus, I again \nconclude that My Eye Doctor has satisfied its burden of production here. \n26 c. Pretext \nMr. Rodriguez has chosen to combine his ADA disparate treatment arguments and his \nADA failure to accommodate arguments. (See id. at 19-20). It is therefore difficult for me to \ndetermine what, exactly, Mr. Rodriguez offers as evidentiary support for the former. It seems, \nhowever, that he offers no evidence distinct from that which I have already discussed and found \nwanting. (See, e.g., id. at 20) (highlighting replacement by new employees \"without a disability \nneeding accommodation \"). \nI therefore conclude that Mr. Rodriguez has not met his burden to adduce evidence from \nwhich a reasonable jury could conclude that My Eye Doctor's rationales are pretextual, and \nGRANT My Eye Doctor's motion for summary judgment with regard to Mr. Rodriguez 's ADA \ndisparate treatment claim. \n2. Failure to Accommodate \nThe ADA prevents a covered employer from failing to provide \"a reasonable \naccommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability. \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) . A plaintiff bringing an ADA failure-to\u00ad\naccommodate claim must establish: \"(1) he was disabled and his employer knew it; (2) he \nrequested an accommodation or assistance; (3) his employer did not make a good faith effort to \nassist; and (4) he could have been reasonably accommodated. \" Capps v. Mondelez Global, LLC, \n847 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). With respect to the employer 's notice of the \ndisability, what matters is \"whether the employee . . . provides the employer with enough \ninformation that, under the circumstances , the employer can be fairly said to know of both the \ndisability and desire for an accommodation. \" Id. at 313. \n27 Here, My Eye Doctor contends that \"the record is devoid of any evidence\" that Mr. \nRodriguez provided My Eye Doctor with notice of a disability or requested a reasonable \naccommodation. (D.I. 33 at 16). Mr. Rodriguez counters that My Eye Doctor received notice \nbecause it was aware of the short-term disability leave and FMLA leave for which Mr. \nRodriguez had previously been approved . (D.I. 39 at 20). I agree with Mr. Rodriguez. \nMy Eye Doctor is right that \"the definition of a 'disability' in the ADA is very different \nfrom the definition of a 'serious health condition ' pursuant to the FMLA.\" (D.I. 42 at 8); 29 \nC.F.R \u00a7 825.702(b) (\"ADA's 'disability ' and FMLA's 'serious health condition ' are different \nconcepts, and must be analyzed separately .\"). The Third Circuit, however, has held that \"a \nrequest for FMLA leave may qualify, under certain circumstances , as a request for a reasonable \naccommodation under the ADA.\" Capps, 847 F.3d at 156-57; see also 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.702(c)(2) \n(providing example of disabled employee 's request for medical leave being treated as both \nFMLA leave and a reasonable accommodation). Although the Third Circuit has not elaborated \nupon what those circumstances are, district courts within the circuit have stated that a request for \nFMLA leave may serve as a request for reasonable accommodation where the employer knows \n( or has reason to believe) \"that the request was based on something other than a one-time\" event. \nIsley v. Aker Phi/a. Shipyard, Inc., 275 F. Supp. 3d 620, 631 (E.D. Pa. 2017). \nHere, Mr. Rodriguez received approval for intermittent FMLA leave through January 30, \n2020. (D.I. 35 at 144). He testified that he used his FMLA leave to attend medical appointments \non a weekly basis (D.I. 40 at 64-67), and that he communicated this to his supervisor (id.) and to \nHuman Resources (id. at 63-64). This testimony is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to \n28 whether Mr. Rodriguez 's prior FMLA requests provided My Eye Doctor notice of his disability11 \nand constituted a request for a reasonable accommodation . As discussed , an issue of fact also \nexists as to whether My Eye Doctor unlawfully interfered with Mr. Rodriguez 's FMLA leave. \nThe notice and request requirements are the only two elements of Mr. Rodriguez 's reasonable \naccommodation claim that My Eye Doctor has challenged. (See D.I. 33 at 15-16). \nI therefore DENY My Eye Doctor's motion for summary judgment with regard to Mr. \nRodriguez 's claim that My Eye Doctor discriminated against him by failing to provide a \nreasonable accommodation . \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n11 My Eye Doctor argues that it could not have been on notice because, under its agreement with \nCigna, Cigna makes FMLA leave determination decisions \"unilaterally. \" (D.I. 42 at 9). Whether \nMy Eye Doctor had input into the FMLA decision is immaterial here. The question is notice, and \nfor notice, Mr. Rodriguez 's communications to his supervisor and to Human Resources are \nenough. See Thomas v. Brandywine Hospital, LLC, 2022 WL 507478, at *6 (E.D.
