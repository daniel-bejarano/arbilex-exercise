LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Motion for Summary Judgment\nIn determining the appropriateness of su mmary judgment, the court must \u201creview\nthe record as a whole, \u2018draw[ing] all reas onable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\nparty[,]\u2019 but [refraining from] weighi ng the evidence or making credibility\ndeterminations.\u201d14  If no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment is appropriate.15 \nThis standard does not change merely because there are cross-motions for\nsummary judgment.16  Cross-motions for summary judgment:\nare no more than a claim by each side that it alone is entitled to summary\njudgment, and the making of such inherent ly contradictory claims does not\nconstitute an agreement that if one is  rejected the other is necessarily\njustified or that the losing party waives judicial consideration and\ndetermination whether genuine issues  of material fact exist.17\n\u201cThe filing of cross-motions for summary judgment does not require the court to\ngrant summary judgment for either party.\u201d18\nB. Court\u2019s Review of the ALJ\u2019s Findings\nThe Commissioner must follow a five-step sequential analysis to determine\nwhether a person is disabled for purposes of qualifying for SSI.19  The Commissioner\n13 D.I. 2.\n14 Reeves v.

Under the substantial-evidence standar d, a court looks to an existing\nadministrative record and asks whether it contains \u201csufficien[t] evidence\u201dto support the agency's factual determinations.  And whatever themeaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d in other contexts, the threshold for such\nevidentiary sufficiency is not high.  Substantial evidence, this Court hassaid, is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla.\u201d\n22\nIn reviewing whether substantial evidenc e supports the Commissioner\u2019s findings, the\ncourt may not \u201cre-weigh the evidence or impose [its] own factual determinations.\u201d23  The\nreviewing court must defer to the ALJ and affirm the Commissioner's decision, even if it\nwould have decided the factual inquiry differently, so long as substantial evidencesupports the decision.\n24\nThe reviewing court must also review  the ALJ\u2019s decision to determine whether\n20 Burns v.

DISCUSSION\nThe ALJ found plaintiff had the following se vere impairments:  bipolar disorder,\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and ADHD.27  The ALJ found plaintiff\u2019s\ndiabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, a right shoulder impairment, and an ankle impairment\nwere not \u201csevere\u201d impairments as defined in the regulations.28  The ALJ posed the\nfollowing hypothetical question to the VE:\n[C]onsider an individual of the claim ant's age, education, and work history,\nwho can perform work at all exertional levels, performing unskilled tasks,with the reasoning level of 1 or 2.  With occasional changes in a routine\nwork setting and work processes.  Occasional interaction with coworkersthat requires no teamwork or tandem  tasks, and no interaction with the\npublic.  Could this person perform the claimant\u2019s past work?\n29\nThe VE responded the hypothetical person could not.30  The ALJ then asked if there\nwould be any jobs that person could perform.31  The VE responded such person would\nbe able to perform jobs at the light and medium  exertional level including:  crate liner,\nmarker, and router.32\nThe ALJ then asked the VE:  \u201cIf an individual would be off task 15 percent or\nmore of the workday . . .

He can tolerateoccasional changes in routine work setting and work processes.  He canhave occasional interaction with coworkers that requires no teamwork ortandem tasks, and no interaction with the public.\n46\n* * * * *\nAfter considering the evidence of record, I find that the claimant\u2019s\nmedically determinable impairments could have reasonably beenexpected to produce the alleged symptoms.   However, in evaluating the\nclaimant's symptoms under the fact ors described in 20 CFR 416.929(c)(3)\nand Social Security Ruling 16-3p, I find t he claimant\u2019s allegations as to the\nnature, intensity, persi stence, and limiting effect s of those symptoms are\nnot fully substantiated by the medi cal signs, laboratory findings and other\nevidence of record [for the reasons explained in this decision.]\n47\nThe ALJ relied upon the VE\u2019s assessments in his final determination and\n42 Id. at 51.\n43 Id.\n44 Id.\n45 Id. at 51-52.\n46 Id. at 20\n47 Id.\n7concluded, considering plaintiff\u2019s age, educ ation, work experience, and RFC, he was\ncapable of making a successful adjustment to other work that existed in significant\nnumbers in the national economy, such as crate liner, marker, and router.48\nPlaintiff\u2019s sole argument for remand is that the ALJ rejected the opinions of\nplaintiff\u2019s mental health treating specialis ts in contradiction to SSA policy and Third\nCircuit precedent.49  Plaintiff contends the opinions of his treating physicians Anna\nHoier, Psy.D. (\u201cDr. Hoier\u201d) and David Nixon, M.D. (\u201cDr. Nixon\u201d) and \u201chis own description\nof his symptoms and limitations (1) describe far greater limitations than those in the \nALJ\u2019s RFC, and (2) meet his burden to prove that he is \u2018disabled.\u2019\u201d50  Plaintiff asserts the\nopinions of his treating physicians are cons istent with, and supported by, the evidence\nand the ALJ did not reasonably find to the contrary.51\nDefendant contends substantial evi dence supports the ALJ\u2019s disability\ndetermination.52  Defendant maintains the ALJ reasonably found the opinions of\nconsultative examiner Joseph Keyes,  Ph.D. (\u201cDr. Keyes\u201d) and state agency\npsychologists persuasive and consistent with plaintiff\u2019s consultative examination,\ntreatment records, activi ties, and routine treatment.53  Defendant also argues the ALJ\nwas reasonable in determining the opinions of  Drs. Nixon and Hoier assessing \u201cserious\u201d\nand \u201cextreme\u201d functional limitations were unpersuasive because they were not\n48 Id. at 24-25.\n49 D.I. 13 at 2, 9-16.\n50 Id. at 11-13.\n51 Id. at 13-16.\n52 D.I. 17 at 1.\n53 Id. at 2.\n8supported by plaintiff\u2019s treatment  and consultative examination.54  The court agrees with\ndefendant.\nPlaintiff was treated by Drs.

(\u201cCenter for Mental Wellness\u201d) duri ng his alleged period of disability, and each\nsubmitted opinions stating, inter alia , that plaintiff\u2019s metal health limitations precluded\nhim from working 40 hours per week without missing more than 2 days of work permonth of remaining, or task at least 80% of the workday.\n55  If those opinions were\naccepted, plaintiff would be disabled.  \u201c[I]t is well established,\u201d however, that a\nphysician\u2019s statements \u201care not binding on t he ALJ, as opinions as to whether a\nclaimant is disabled or unable to work is reserved for the Commissioner of Social\nSecurity.\u201d56  Moreover, \u201ceven if the statements fr om Plaintiff's physicians were to be\nconsidered as opinions, they would not be entitled to controlling weight under the\nrelevant regulations.  For cases . . . fil ed on or after March 27, 2017, the regulations\nhave eliminated the \u2018treating physician rule.\u2019\u201d57\nA plaintiff's RFC is his maximum remain ing ability to do sustained work activities\nin an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.58  This contemplates\nfull-time employment and is defined as eight  hours a day, five days per week, or another\nsimilar schedule.59  The RFC assessment must include a discussion of the individual\u2019s\n54 Id.\n55 D.I. 13 at 6-9 (citing Tr. 721 (Dr. Nixon); Tr. 326 (Dr. Hoier); Tr. 859 (Dr.\nHoier)).\n56 See, e.g., Johnson v.
