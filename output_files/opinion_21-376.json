FLETCHER, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nV.\nLERON WILLIAMS,\n\nDefendant.\n\n: Civil Action No. 21-376-CFC\n\n: Justice of the Peace Court of the State of\n: Delaware in and for Sussex County\n\n: No. JP17-20-004268\n\nLeron Williams, Seaford, Delaware. Pro se Defendant.\n\nDecember 17, 2021\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nBANC n\n\nDefendant Leron Williams filed a notice of removal on March 15, 2021, of\nFletcher v. Williams, Case No. JP17-20-004268 (Del. J.P. Ct.). (D.I. 2) Defendant\nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.|. 7) For\nthe reasons discussed below, the Court will remand the matter to the Justice of the\nPeace Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County for want of jurisdiction.\nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis case involves a landlord/tenant case filed in the Justice of the Peace Court\nin and for Sussex County, Delaware. Defendant removed the matter on March 15,\n2021. He asserts jurisdiction in this Court by reason of a federal question pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. (D.I. 2 at 1) He also references 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441(a), 1441(b),\n1443(1), 1446(a), 1446(b), and 1446(d). Plaintiff invokes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for \u201cwrongful\ndisparate tortfeasors/violators of United States law.\u201d (/d. at 3)\n\nPlaintiffs and other family members notified Defendant that he was required to\nvacate their mother\u2019s home on or before November 1, 2020. (D.I. 2-1 at 1) Defendant\nwas advised that if he did not, his family members would bring an action to evict him\nfrom their mother\u2019s home. (D.I. 2-1 at 1)\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nThe removal statute is strictly construed, requiring remand to state court if any\ndoubt exists over whether removal was proper. Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets,\n313 U.S. 100, 104 (1941). A court will remand a removed case \u201cif at any time before\nfinal judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The party seeking removal bears the burden to establish federal\n1\njurisdiction. Steel Valley Auth. v. Union Switch & Signal Div. Am. Standard, Inc., 809\nF.2d 1006, 1010 (3d Cir. 1987); Zoren v. Genesis Energy, L.P., 195 F. Supp. 2d 598,\n602 (D. Del. 2002). In determining whether remand based upon improper removal is\nappropriate, the court \u201cmust focus on the plaintiff's complaint at the time the petition for\nremoval was filed,\u201d and assume all factual allegations therein are true. Steel Valley\nAuth., 809 F.2d at 1010.\n\nHere, Defendant contends there is federal subject matter jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and attempts to raise a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Another possible\nbasis for jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, diversity jurisdiction.\n\nWith respect to federal question jurisdiction, Defendant fails to meet his burden to\nshow that any claims arise under federal law. He invokes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To state a\n\u00a7 1983 claim there must be allegations that some person has deprived of a federal\nright, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted under color of state law.\nWest v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). Attachments to the Complaint indicate that\nPlaintiffs Debra W. Fletcher and Christine Williams are family members of Defendant\nwho seek to remove him from their mother\u2019s home. There is no indication that either\nPlaintiff is a state actor. In addition, the notice of removal does not point to any other\npossible federal claims.\n\nThe only other basis for jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1332. There is not complete diversity of citizenship as is required to invoke diversity\njurisdiction. Plaintiff Williams and Defendant are both residents of Delaware.\n\nDefendant did not meet his burden to establish federal jurisdiction. Therefore,\n\nthe case will be summarily remanded to state court for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nr4\nIll. \u00a9 CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed above, the case will be summarily remanded to State\n\nCourt.\n\nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n"}
