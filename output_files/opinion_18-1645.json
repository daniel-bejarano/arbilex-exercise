{"case_name": "Carrum Technologies, LLC v. BMW of North America, LLC, et al", "case_number": "18-1645", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "02-09-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nCARRUM TECHNOLOGIES , LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBMW of NORTH AMERICA, LLC , \nBMW MANUF ACTURlNG CO., LLC, and \nBA YERlSCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG , \nDefendants. C.A. No. 18-1645-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nBefore me is Defendants ' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \n(D.I. 102). The motion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 103, 105, 108). \nOn October 23, 2018, Plaintiff Carrum filed its original complaint alleging infringement of \nU.S. Patent Nos. 7,512,475 and 7,925,416 (collectively, the \"Asserted Patents\") against \nDefendants BMW of North America (\"BMW NA\") and BMW Manufacturing Co. (\"BMW MC\"). \n(D.I. 1). Carrum filed its First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") on May 5, 2021, adding Bayerische \nMotoren Werke AG (\"BMW AG\") as a defendant. (D.I. 81). \nOn May 13, 2022, I dismissed Carrum's claims against BMW AG for direct infringement \nat any time and indirect infringement prior to the filing date of the FAC. (D.I. 93 at 2-4). I denied \nBMW AG's motion to dismiss Carrum's claim for induced infringement after the date the FAC \nwas served on BMW AG. (Id. at 3-5). I gave Carrum leave to amend its complaint to allege BMW \nAG had knowledge of the Asserted Patents as of the filing date of the original complaint. (Id. at 3 \nn.2). Carrum filed its Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on June 2, 2022. (D.I. 99). \n1 BMW AG now moves to dismiss the SAC under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim \nfor both pre-suit and post-suit induced infringement. (D.I. 102).1 For purposes ofthis motion, \"pre\u00ad\nsuit\" refers to the time prior to the filing of the original complaint on October 23, 2018, and \"post\u00ad\nsuit\" refers to the time after the original complaint was filed. (See D.l. 103 at 2; D.I. 105 at 7). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule \n12(b)(6) allows the accused party to bring a motion to dismiss a claim for \"failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted \nonly if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the counterclaim complaint as true and viewing \nthem in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \"could \nnot raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, \nconclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim elements. Id. at 555 (\"Factual allegations must \nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the \nallegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in fact).\"). Moreover, there must be sufficient \nfactual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied when the complaint's factual content \"allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" \n1 I stayed the case for BMW NA and BMW MC (D.I. 80), and I have not lifted the stay. The \nreason for the stay was to decide whether the foreign defendant (BMW AG) was in the case. At \nthe time, that made sense because BMW AG was raising a personal jurisdiction issue. (D.I. 85). \nBMW AG later dropped that particular argument. (D.I. 91 at 2 n.1). All three defendants joined \nthe pending motion to dismiss. (D.I. 102). But Carrum answered as though only BMW AG was \nfiling the motion. (D.I. 105). I will treat the motion as only being made by BMW AG. I will lift \nthe stay against the other two defendants. I do not want to encourage more motion to dismiss \nbriefing that just rehashes arguments that BMW AG has made and which I address in this \nMemorandum Order. \n2 Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant 's liability, it stops \nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \nBMW AG asserts three arguments for dismissing Carrum's claims. I address them in turn. \nFirst, BMW AG moves to dismiss Carrum's claims for pre-suit induced infringement \nbecause Carrum failed to allege that BMW AG had knowledge of the Asserted Patents before the \noriginal complaint was filed. (D.I. 103 at 8-11). \nInduced infringement \"requires knowledge of the patent in suit and knowledge of patent \ninfringement. \" Cammi! USA, LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 575 U.S. 632, 639 (2015). \"At the pleading \nstage, alleged knowledge of patent family members and related patents, along with other \nallegations, can be sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss.\" Novozymes N Am., Inc. v. Danisco \nUS Inc., 2020 WL 12895027, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 12, 2020). \"[T]he Court need not evaluate whether \neach allegation , standing alone, gives rise to a reasonable inference that [BMW AG] had pre-suit \nknowledge of the patent. Instead, the Court may consider the allegations as a whole.\" Id. at *2. \nI find Carrum failed to plausibly allege that BMW AG had pre-suit knowledge of the \nAsserted Patents. Carrum's only allegation of BMW AG's pre-suit knowledge is that BMW AG \nknew of the Asserted Patents' foreign counterpart because BMW AG cited to it during the \nprosecution of its own German patent. (D.I. 99, 1 29). This is not sufficient. \"Knowledge of a \nforeign patent does not provide notice of a 'corresponding ' U.S. patent.\" PPG Indus. Ohio, Inc. v. \nAxalta Coating Sys., LLC, 2022 WL 610740, at *5 (D. Del. Jan. 26, 2022), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2022 WL 611260 (D. Del. Feb. 18, 2022). \nI disagree with Carrum that alleging BMW AG investigated the German counterpart patent \nwhen it prosecuted its patent application , and that BMW AG would have found the Asserted \n3 Patents through its research, are sufficient \"other allegations. \" See Novozymes , 2020 WL \n12895027, at *3. The case law shows that such \"other allegations \" provide more and are less \nspeculative . For example, in Novozymes, sufficient other allegations included three separate \noccasions where the defendants learned of the patent at issue when it was prosecuting its own \napplication , and that the defendants attended a conference where the patent was presented . 2020 \nWL 12895027, at *2-3. In Elm JDS Innovations , LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co., the Magistrate Judge \nfound allegations of the defendants' knowledge of a patent's parent and other patents in the family, \ntaken together with the multiple allegations demonstrating the patent's notoriety in the defendants ' \n\"tight knit\" industry to be sufficient. 2015 WL 5725768, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2015), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2016 WL 1274812 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2016). Therefore, the motion to \ndismiss for failure to plausibly allege pre-suit induced infringement is GRANTED. \nSecond, BMW AG argues that Carrum failed to allege facts that BMW AG had pre-suit \nintent to induce infringement . Because I find that Carrum failed to allege BMW AG had pre-suit \nknowledge of the Asserted Patents, I do not need to address this issue. \nThird, BMW AG moves to dismiss Carrum's claims for post-suit induced infringement \nbecause these allegations \"are based on alleged knowledge gained after Carrum filed its patent \ninfringement allegations.\" (D.I. 103 (citing D.I. 100, ,r,r 30-35)). \nThe caselaw in our district is split on whether a filed complaint can be used to satisfy the \nknowledge requirement for post-suit induced infringement. See, e.g., ZapFraud, Inc. v. Barracuda \nNetworks , Inc., 528 F. Supp. 3d 247,250 n.2 (D. Del. 2021) (collecting cases). \nI take the position that Carrum is permitted to allege a post-suit indirect infringement claim \nbased on knowledge from the original complaint. See Wrinkl, Inc. v. Face book, Inc., 2021 WL \n4477022, at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). I already addressed this issue in this case. I found that \n4 Carrum plausibly alleged BMW AG had knowledge of the Asserted Patents as of the filing of the \nF AC because the F AC supplied the knowledge of the Asserted Patents. (D.I. 93 at 3; see D.I. 86 \nat 8 (arguing same); D.I. 91 at 7 (arguing same)). It would make little sense for me to grant Carrum \nleave to amend the F AC to plead BMW AG had knowledge as of the date of the original complaint \nif that complaint, which did not name BMW AG as a defendant, could not possibly provide \nknowledge of the Asserted Patents. (See D.I. 93 at 3 n.2). I am not persuaded by BMW AG's \npolicy argument to change my ruling and adopt the holding in ZapFraud. \nI nevertheless find Carrum plausibly alleges that BMW AG had post-suit knowledge of the \nAsserted Patents. Carrum alleges that (1) BMW AG's legal counsel has direct control over BMW \nNA and BMW MC; (2) BMW A G's legal counsel emailed a copy of the original complaint and \nthe Asserted Patents to one of its suppliers inquiring about the potential of infringement in January \n2019; and (3) BMW NA filed three IPR petitions against each Asserted Patent in April 2019, each \nof which named BMW AG as a real party in interest. (D.I. 99 at 9-10).2 These allegations are \nsufficient to support an inference that BMW AG had knowledge of the Asserted Patents prior to \nthe F AC being filed. It is reasonable to infer that BMW NA or BMW MC sent a copy of the \noriginal complaint to BMW AG shortly after they were served. Carrum's allegations are also \nsufficient to plausibly support an inference of intent to induce infringement. (D.I. 99 ,r,r 25-26, 40, \n46-47, 51, 56-57; see also D.I. 93 at 3-5 (finding allegations sufficient)). \nBMW A G's motion to dismiss Carrum's claim of induced infringement before the original \ncomplaint was filed is GRANTED. BMW AG's motion to dismiss Carrum's claim of induced \ninfringement for after the filing date of the original complaint is DENIED. \n2 I previously gave no weight to these allegations because Carrum only raised them in the \nbriefing of BMW AG's motion to dismiss the FAC. (D.I. 93 at 3). I consider them now because \nthey are included in the SAC. \n5 The stay as to the other two defendants is LIFTED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this ~ay of February 2023. \n6 "}
