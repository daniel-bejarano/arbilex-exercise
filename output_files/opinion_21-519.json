Andrews  \nANDREWS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:  \nBefore me is  the issue of claim construction of multiple terms in U.S. Patent No. \n10,660,986 (\u201cthe \u2019986 patent\u201d). The parties submitted a Joint Claim Construction Brief ( D.I. 81), \nand I hear d oral argument on May 20, 2022.1  \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe parties requested construction for six terms  contained in Claim 1 of the \u2019986 patent. \nClaim 1, with the terms at issue identified by italics, reads : \nAn implant comprising:  \ncortical allograft bone and cancellous allograft bone obtained from an \n   allograft donor , wherein the cancellous allograft bone is processed by a  \n   method comprising:  \n     osmotically lysing bone marrow cells in the allograft cancellous bone to enrich  \n         for cells resistant to osmotic lysing , wherein the step of osmotically lysing \n         comprises exposing the allograft cancellous bone to water or less than 1M  \n         acetic acid, and  \n    during and following the lysing, allowing both the cells resistant to the lysing \n        and growth fac tors released from the cancellous allograft bone to bind to the  \n        cancellous and cortical allograft bones ; \n    when implanted, the implant comprises the cells resistant to lysing  and the  \n       growth factors each associated with the allograft cancellous bone . \n \nAt oral argument, I construed \u201ccortical allograft bone and cancellous allograft bone \nobtained from an allograft donor\u201d  to mean, \u201ccortical bone and cancellous bone obtained from a \ndonor of the same species.\u201d I noted that in the context of this construction, \u201ca donor\u201d need not be \nlimited  to a single donor . (Tr. 35:18- 36:1).  \nAt oral argument, the parties agreed that  \u201cgrowth factors . . . associated with the allograft \ncancellous bone \u201d should be construed as referring to the growth factors described in the \nimmediately preceding claim limitation that are \u201creleased from the cancellous allograft bone\u201d and \n \n1  Citations to the transcript of the oral a rgument are preceded by \u201cTr.\u201d  3 \n \u201callow[ed]\u201d \u201cto bind to the cancellous and cortical allograft bones.\u201d  (Tr. 87:3- 17). I now formally \nadopt the construction, \u201cgrowth factors released from and in the same composition as  the allograft \ncancellous bone.\u201d  \n The four remaining disputed terms are listed in the chart belo w, accompanied by each \nparty\u2019s proposed construction. \nTerm  Plaintiff\u2019s  Proposed \nConstruction  Defendant\u2019s Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201cthe cancellous and \ncortical allograft \nbones\u201d  \u201cthe cancellous and \ncortical bones from an \nallograft donor\u201d  \u201ccancellous and cortical \nallograft bone that \ncomprise the implant\u201d  \n\u201cgrowth factors\u201d  \u201cstimulative agents that \npromote growth, repair or \nregeneration of tissues\u201d  \u201csubstances released \nfrom lysed cells capable of stimulating bone \ngrowth\u201d  \n\u201ccells resistant to \n[osmotic] lysing\u201d  \u201ccells that remain intact \nafter exposure to a lysing agent\u201d  Plain meaning (\u201ccells \nthat naturally resist the disruption of cell walls due to osmotic movement of fluid into \nthe cell\u201d)  \n\u201ccells resistant to \n[osmotic] lysing . . . associated w ith the \nallograft cancellous \nbone\u201d  \u201ccells that remain intact \nin the porous bone structure and on the bone surface after exposure to \na weak lysing agent\u201d  \u201ccells resistant to osmotic \nlysing bound, directly or indirectly, to the allograft cancellous bone\u201d  \n \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c\u2018[T]here is no magic formula or \ncatechism for conducting claim construction.\u2019  Instead, the court is free to attach the appropriate \nweight to appropriate sources \u2018in light of the statutes and policies that infor m patent law.\u2019\u201d  \nSoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., 2013 WL 4758195, at *1 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2013) (quoting Phillips , 4 \n 415 F.3d at 1324)  (alteration in original) .  When construing patent claims, a court considers the \nliteral language of the claim, the patent speci fication, and the prosecution history.  Markman v. \nWestview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 977\u201380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 \n(1996).  Of these sources, \u201cthe specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction \nanalysis.  Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1315 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n\u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning. . . .  \n[Which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Id.  at \n1312\u201313 (citations  and internal quotation marks omitted ).  \u201c[T ]he ordinary meaning of a claim \nterm is its meaning to [an] ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id.  at 1321  (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  \u201cIn some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction \nin such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.\u201d  Id. at 1314.  \nWhen a court relies solely upon the intrinsic evide nce\u2014the patent claims, the specification, \nand the prosecution history\u2014the court\u2019s construction is a determination of law.  See Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 574 U.S. 318, 331 (2015) .  The  court may also make factual findings \nbased upon consideration of extrinsic evidence, which \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dict ionaries, and learned \ntreatises. \u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at  1317\u201319 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Extrinsic evidence \nmay assist the court in understanding the underlying technology, the meaning of terms to one 5 \n skilled in the art, and how the invention works.  Id.  Extrinsic evidence, however, is less reliab le \nand less useful in claim construction than the patent and its prosecution history.  Id . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Term 22: the cancellous and cortical allograft bones  \nThe focus of  the parties\u2019 dispute with respect  to Term 2, \u201cthe cancellous and cortical \nallograft bones,\u201d is whether the  referenced  cortical allograft bone must be used in the final implant. \nBoth parties agree  the antecedent basis of \u201cthe\u201d cancellous and cortical allograft bones in Term 2 \nis the cancellous and cortical allograft bone from the first limitation  of Claim 1 , which reads, \u201cAn \nimplant comprising: cortical allograft bone and cancellous allograft bone obtained from an \nallograft donor.\u201d Defendant argues this necessitates that the cortical allograft bone referenced in \nTerm 2 be  used in the final implant. I disagree.  \nAntecedent basis requires that the cortical allograft bone of Term 2 be from the same supply \nof cortical allograft bone that is \u201cobtain ed from an allograft donor\u201d at the beginning of Claim 1. \nThere is not, however, any requirement that the entire supply of cortical allograft bone harvested  \nfrom the allograft donor make it into the final implant, so long as the final implant contains some \ncortical allograft bone obtained from the  allograft donor.  \nClaim 1 requires that the implant, in its final form, comprise cortical allograft bone and \ncancellous allograft bone obtained from an allograft donor. It then describes the method by which \nthe cancellous  allograft bone obtained from the donor must be  processed. Term 2 is found within \nthe claim limitations describing that method for processing cancellous bone. Claim 1  requires that \nthe cancellous allograft bone used in the final implant be proces sed according to the  method \ndescribed . By contrast, the claim  is silent as to whether any processing must be  performed on the \n \n2  I use the \u201cterm\u201d numbering that the parties used in the Joint Claim Construction Brief. 6 \n cortical allograft bone  that is ultimately used in the final implant . While the claim implies that \nsome of the cortical bone obta ined from the allograft donor will be processed alongside the \ncancellous bone, there is  no requirement that all the cortical bone obtained from the allograft donor \nfor use in the final implant be processed alongside the cancellous bone , nor is there any \nrequirement that the cortical bone that is processed alongside the cancellous bone make it into the \nfinal implant. The claim is silent as to  whether the cortical bone used in the final implant should \nbe entirely processed cortical bone, entirely unprocessed cortical bone, or some mixture of the two.  \nFor these reasons, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction, \u201c the cancellous and cortical \nbones from an allograft donor.\u201d  \nB. Term 3: g rowth factors  \nWith respect to Term 3, \u201cgrowth factors,\u201d the parties\u2019 dispute centers on whether the \nlimitation, \u201creleased from lysed cells ,\u201d should be included in the term\u2019s construction. Plaintiff  \nargues  this limitation is unnecessary, because the claims themselves already require that the growth \nfactors be \u201creleased from the cancellous allograft bone.\u201d Defendant responds that th e term, \n\u201cgrowth factors ,\u201d appears immediately following the claim\u2019s limitation of \u201cosmotically lysing \nbone marrow cells ,\u201d and therefore, the growth factors necessarily must be released from those \nlysed cells.  \nAt oral argument, neither party provided any examples  of how growth factors could be \n\u201creleased from the cancellous allograft bone\u201d without being \u201creleased from lysed cells.\u201d Nevertheless, while Defendant\u2019s proposed limitation and the limitation within the claim language  \nmay well be co -extensive for practical purposes, formally, the limitation , \u201creleased from the \ncancellous allograft bone,\u201d is broader than, \u201creleased from lysed cells .\u201d Because a clear limitation 7 \n on the source of the growth factors already exists in the claim, I decline to adopt Defend ant\u2019s \nproposed narrower limitation.  \nI do not think the examples Defendant cites from the specification discussing growth \nfactors released from lysed cells rise to the level of disclaimer of any other potential source of \ngrowth factors within the cancellou s allograft bone. ( See D.I. 81 at 31- 32). Rather, these excerpts \nfrom the specification , e.g., \u201c[t]he harvested sample can be exposed to lysing conditions and/or a \nlysing agent to facilitate lysis of the cells therein to r elease growth factors and nutrient s contained \n[in the] sample,\u201d and, \u201c[o]nce cellular components are lysed, they release growth factors and/or \nbioactive materials, such as cytokines and nutrients, to stimulate growth, differentiation and repair,\u201d merely provide an example of how growth fac tors can be \u201creleased from the cancellous \nallograft bone,\u201d as claimed in Claim 1. (\u2019986 Patent 2:31- 33, 2:35- 38).  \nThe example Defendant cites from the prosecution history, where Advanced Biologics \nasserted the claimed invention \u201cresults in a unique mixture of growth factors that does not read on \n\u2018any and all\u2019 growth factors ,\u201d and the prior art did not \u201cteach or suggest the unique mixture of \ngrowth factors that is produced when bone marrow or cancellous bone is osmotically lysed,\u201d is consistent with the plain meaning definition of growth factors, as limited by the language of Claim 1. (D.I. 81  at 32 (citing D.I. 82- 2 at ZB012851, ZB012838- 44)).  The term \u201cgrowth factors\u201d as it \nappears in Claim 1 does not \u201cread on any and all growth factors.\u201d It is inst ead limited to growth \nfactors \u201creleased from the cancellous allograft bone.\u201d If it is possible for growth factors to be \nreleased from a source within the cancellous allograft bone other than lysed bone marrow cells, \nsuch growth factors would be covered by the plain language of Claim 1.  \nFor these reasons, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s construction, \u201c stimulative agents that promote growth, \nrepair, or regeneration of tissues.\u201d  8 \n C. Term 5: c ells resistant to [osmotic] lysing  \nWith respect to Term 5, the parties disagree over whether the term, \u201ccells resistant to \n[osmotic] lysing,\u201d refers generally to cells known to have the property of being resistant to lysing \nor refers specifically to those cancellous bone marrow cells that  have survived the osmotic  lysing \ndescribed in the process limitations of Claim 1. Defendant argues , \u201cAdvanced Biologics\u2019 proposed \nconstruction would be fine for purposes of assessing infringement of the claimed process steps, but it . . . ignores the Federal Circuit\u2019s law with respect to how product -by-process claims are \napplied when assessing invalidity.\u201d\n3 (D.I. 81 at 43 -44 (citing Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Sandoz , 566 F.3d \n1282, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re Thorpe , 777 F.2d 695, 697- 98 (Fed. Cir. 1985))).  \nInsofar as Defendant suggest s a claim term can  have a different meaning in the context of \nan invalidity analysis than in the context of an infringement analysis , Defendant is mistaken. See \nPurdue Pharma L.P. v. Epic Pharma, LLC , 811 F.3d 1345, 1354 (Fed Cir. 2016) ( a product -by-\nproce ss claim claiming a product that is identical to  a prior art product is invalid, even if made by \na different process than the prior art product ; however, where  \u201cthe process by which a product is \nmade imparts structural and functional differences distinguishing the claimed product from the prior art ,\u201d those differences are relevant to the invalidity analysis ) (cleaned up); Amgen Inc. v. F. \nHoffmann- La Roche Ltd, 580 F.3d 1340, 1364- 70 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (no anticipation where patent \nclaimed a composition containing \u201cerythropoietin . . . purified from mammalian cells grown in culture\u201d and prior art disclosed erythropoietin obtained from urine, because source limitati on \nimparted \u201cstructural and functional differences\u201d that were \u201cnot explicitly part of the claim, yet relevant as evidence of no anticipation because of the source limitation.\u201d).  \n \n3  The parties agree that Claim 1 is a product -by-process claim.  9 \n While process limitations need not be met to prove invalidity of a product -by-process \nclaim , the meaning of a claim term, even in a product -by-process claim, is the same for all \npurposes . Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 314 F.3d 1313, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2003)  (\u201cIt \nis axiomatic that claims are construed the same way for both invalidity and infringement.\u201d) . \nMoreover, while Defendant is correct that only structural limitations are considered in the \ninvalidity analysis of a product -by-process claim, Plaintiff is c orrect that, in a product -by-process \nclaim, the process can be used to define structural limitations or properties  of the product . Purdue \nPharma, 811 F.3d at 1354; Abbott Lab\u2019ys , 566 F.3d at 1294 (\u201c[I]f an inventor invents a product \nwhose structure is either not fully known or too complex to analyze . . ., this court clarifies that the \ninventor is absolutely free to use process steps to define this product.\u201d) . Such is the case here.  \nThe phrase, \u201ccells resistant to lysing,\u201d as it appears in  the final paragraph of Claim 1, is \npreceded by the article \u201cthe,\u201d  signaling the phrase  has an  antecedent basis.  Its antecedent basis is \nfound in the process limitations of Claim 1, which describe \u201cosmotically lysing bone marrow cells \nin the allograft canc ellous bone to enrich for cells resistant to osmotic lysing,\u201d  and \u201callowing . . . \nthe cells resistant to the lysing . . . to bind to the cancellous and cortical allograft bones.\u201d  Thus, \n\u201cthe cells resistant to lysing\u201d in Term 5 refers to those cells that resisted th at osmotic lysing \nprocess.   \nAs Advanced Biologics explained to the Examiner during prosecution of the \u2019986 Patent, \nwhen an implant is created according to the process described in Claim 1, the \u201ccells resistant to \nlysing\u201d that  are contained in the implant in its final form include both mesenchymal stem cells \n(MSCs)  and \u201c other progenitor cells ,\u201d such as \u201cadipocytes, chondrocytes, [etc.].\u201d (D.I. 82 -2 at \nZB012851). Thus, the structural claim limitation, \u201ccells resistan t to lysing ,\u201d defines  a specific set \nof cells consisting  of MSCs, adipocytes, chondrocytes , etc.  Defendant\u2019s construction would 10 \n impermissibly allow the structural limitation, \u201ccells resistant to lysing ,\u201d to be satisfied by a \nphysically different set of cells, such as one co nsisting only of MSCs. (Tr. 88:7- 89:2).  \nConstruing Term 5 to include any cells that have the property of being resistant to lysing \nwould be inconsistent with the plain meaning of the claim , the prosecution history, and the doctrine \nof antecedent basis . The inventors here defined the structural limits of this ter m by reference to the \nclaimed process . This is precisely the \u201cexceptional instance\u201d where \u201cthe structure of the claimed \nproduct is unknown and the product can be defined only by reference to a process by which it can \nbe made. \u201d Abbott Lab\u2019ys , 566 F.3d at 1294. Claim 1 does not disclose an implant comprising \u2018 any \ncells known to be resistant to lysing, \u2019 as Defendant argues. Claim 1 discloses an implant \ncomprising \u201c the cells\u201d resistant to the previously described lysing process.  \nFor these reasons, I a dopt the construction, \u201ccells that remain after exposure to the claimed \nlysing process.\u201d  \nD. Term 6: cells resistant to [osmotic] lysing . . . associated with the allograft cancellous \nbone  \nAt oral argument, the parties agreed that Term 6, \u201ccells resistant to [ osmotic] lysing . . . \nassociated with the allograft cancellous bone\u201d should be construed by combining the construction  \nfor the term, \u201c cells resistant to [osmotic] lysing ,\u201d with the construction for the second clause of the \nterm, \u201cgrowth factors associated with the allograft cancellous bone.\u201d (Tr. 84:14- 86:1). Therefore, \nI adopt the following construction for Term 6: \u201ccells that remain after exposure to the claimed lysing process , in the same composition as the allograft cancellous bone.\u201d  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I adopt the following constructions:  \nTerm  Construction  11 \n \u201cthe cancellous and cortical \nallograft bones\u201d  \u201cthe cancellous and cortical bones from an \nallograft donor\u201d  \n\u201cgrowth factors\u201d  \u201cstimulative agents that promote growth, repair \nor regeneration of tissues\u201d  \n\u201ccells resistant to [osmotic] \nlysing\u201d  \u201ccells that remain after exposure to the claimed \nlysing process \u201d \n\u201ccells resistant to [osmotic] \nlysing . . . associated with the \nallograft cancellous bone\u201d  \u201ccells tha t remain after exposure to the claimed \nlysing process, in the same composition as the \nallograft cancellous bone \u201d \n \nThe parties should submit a n appropriate order within five days.
