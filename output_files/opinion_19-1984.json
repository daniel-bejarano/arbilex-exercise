(D.I. 1; DI. 7) The State filed Answer in opposition, to\nwhich Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 11; D.I. 14) For the reasons discussed, the\nCourt will dismiss the Petitioner\u2019s request for habeas relief.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\n[InJn 2009 the Delaware State Police began an\ninvestigation into a drug trafficking ring in Kent County,\nDelaware. The investigation identified a number of\nparticipants including Marquinn Bordley (\u201cBordley\u201d),\nWilliam Loper (\u201cLoper\u2019) and [Petitioner]. Law\nenforcement recorded the investigation in police reports.\nIn furtherance of the investigation Detective Jeremiah\nLloyd engaged in four separate hand-to-hand transactions\nof illicit drugs, primarily crack cocaine, with [Petitioner].\nAs a result of these drug deals, law enforcement obtained\n[Petitioner\u2019s] phone number and obtained a court ordered\nPen Register on his cellular telephone line. As the\ninvestigation into the drug trafficking ring continued,\nincluding five additional drug transactions between\n[Petitioner] and Detective Lloyd, law enforcement sought\nand received a wire intercept, or wiretap order for\n[Petitioners\u2019] cellular telephone line from the Superior\nCourt. The order permitted the interception of all\ncommunication to and from [Petitioner\u2019s] cell phone\nbeginning on May 7, 2010. Intercepted communications\nfrom this phone line and additional information gathered\nthrough police surveillance led to additional wire orders\non the phones of Bordley and Loper, among others.\nDuring the pendency of the wiretap, law enforcement\nofficers monitored the intercepted calls and conducted\nsurveillance to corroborate information from the calls,\nwhen practicable. On May 7, 2010, officers intercepted\ncalls from [Petitioner] indicative of extortion. [Petitioner]\ntook a 1996 Pontiac Transport van from a drug client\nbecause of an unpaid debt. Additional calls showed\n[Petitioner] storing the vehicle, directing its use and\nplanning for its disposal. Two days later on May 9, 2010,\ncalls indicated that [Petitioner], who was a person\nprohibited from buying or possession firearms or\nammunition, was directing one of his drug buyers to\npurchase ammunition for him,\n\nOn May 12, 2010, intercepted calls showed [Petitioner]\ndelivering either crack cocaine or marijuana to other\nindividuals including Karen Sebastian, Kyle Scott and\nDavid Vilone. Later in the month, calls indicated that\n[Petitioner] was in possession of a firearm.\n\nCoinciding with the monitoring of [Petitioner\u2019s] phone,\nlaw enforcement officers intercepted calls between\nBordley, Lope and Nathaniel Evans (\u201cEvans\u201d). These calls\nshowed that two kilograms of cocaine were delivered by\nJuan Carlos Benitez to Bordley and Evans. Conversations\nfrom Bordley's phone line showed the distribution\nnetwork for the cocaine leading law enforcement to\nconclude that [Petitioner] was part of this network. After\nBordley obtained his kilogram of cocaine, call intercepts\nand surveillance indicated that [Petitioner] obtained\napproximately 3 ounces of cocaine from him.\n\nOn May 21, 2010, two days after the kilogram deal,\nDetective Lloyd purchased 3.5 grams of crack cocaine and\nan amount of marijuana from [Petitioner]. Later that day,\nintercepted calls showed [Petitioner] concerned about a\nhandgun hidden in his car. Law enforcement executed a\nstop on this car and the gun was seized. In the days\nfollowing, intercepted calls and surveillance showed\n\n2\n\n[Petitioner] purchasing drugs from Bordley and then\nselling them.\n\nOn one occasion intercepted calls indicated that\n[Petitioner] sold cocaine to Renell Carter (\u201cCarter\u201d). After\nthe sale [Petitioner] discussed the cash he saw in Carter's\npossession and discussed a plan to rob her at gunpoint.\n[Petitioner], realizing that Carter would recognize him,\narranged for Rakeem Peace (\u201cPeace\u201d) to commit the actual\ncrime by directing him on how to commit the robbery and\nproviding him with a firearm. Calls between [Petitioner],\nPeace and Carter indicate that the robbery occurred but\nwas not financially fruitful. Following the robbery,\n[Petitioner] can be heard arranging for the storage and\nretrieval of the gun and arranging more drug deals.\n\nOn June 13, 2010, [Petitioner] arranged for Frederick\nJames (\u201cJames\u201d) to be lured to an area where it would be\nconvenient for [Petitioner] to shoot at him (Exhibit E).\nIntercepted calls showed [Petitioner] arranging to pick up\nhis gun, ordering someone to wipe fingerprints off of the\nammunition and directing others to get James into\nposition. Later in the investigation James informed police\nthat he was shot at by [Petitioner] due to ongoing issues\nbetween the two. Police also seized shell casings in the\narea where the shooting occurred.\n\nDelaware State Police executed arrest warrants related to\nthis investigation on June 15, 2010. That afternoon the\npolice learned that [Petitioner] was going to the residence\nat 139 Barney Jenkins Road in Felton, a location where\n[Petitioner] was known to store a firearm (Exhibit F). The\npolice arrived while [Petitioner] was still in his vehicle\noutside of the residence. As the police entered the\ndriveway, [Petitioner] rammed his vehicle into the driver's\nside of the police vehicle. The impact occurred as Trooper\nBallenger was attempting to exit, trapping his leg in the\ndoor. After hitting the police vehicle, [Petitioner] reversed\nhis vehicle and then proceeded forward again. This time\n\n3\n\n[Petitioner] struck a second police vehicle head on. The\n\npolice shot at the vehicle, which reversed at a high rate of\n\nspeed and the vehicle finally came to rest after it hit a shed.\nState v. Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *1\u20142 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 28, 2018).\n\nOn January 26, 2012, Petitioner pled guilty to the following charges: one\n\ncount of racketeering (11 Del. C. \u00a7 1503); one count of trafficking more than 100\ngrams of cocaine (16 Del. C. \u00a7 4753A); two counts of trafficking cocaine 10-50\ngrams (16 Del. C. \u00a7 4753); one count of possession of a firearm by a person\nprohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u201d) (11 Del. C. \u00a7 1448); one count of possession of a firearm\nduring the commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d) (11 Del. C. \u00a7 1447A); two counts of\npossession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony (\u201cPD WDCF\u201d)\n(11 Del. C. \u00a7 1447); one count of second degree assault (11 Del. C. \u00a7 612); one\ncount of first degree reckless endangering (11 Del. C. \u00a7 604); one count of\nresisting arrest (11 Del. C. \u00a7 1257); and one count of failure to stop for a police\nsignal (21 Del. C. \u00a7 4103). (D.I. 11 at 5) On March 29, 2012, the Superior Court\nsentenced Petitioner to a total of fifty-eight years of incarceration, suspended after\nserving thirty-seven years for probation. (D.I. 10-2 at 9-18) The Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence on November 9,\n2012. See Thomas v. State, 55 A.3d 839 (Table), 2012 WL 5499649, at *2 (Del.\n\nNov. 9, 2012).\nOn September 26, 2013, Petitioner filed a pro se motion for an extension of\ntime to file a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court\nCriminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d) along with a motion to appoint counsel.\n\n(D.I. 10-1 at Entry Nos 45, 46) The Superior Court granted the motions and\nappointed counsel. (D.I. 10-1 at Entry No. 49) On October 5, 2015, the Superior\nCourt issued an order requiring Petitioner to file a Rule 61 motion on or before\nOctober 26, 2016. (D.I. 10-1 at Entry No. 62) Petitioner\u2019s original post-conviction\ncounsel was unable to continue his representation of Petitioner and, on December\n21, 2015, the Superior Court appointed substitute post-conviction counsel. (D.I.\n10-1 at Entry No. 55) Substitute post-conviction counsel filed a Rule 61 motion in\nOctober 2016 along with a motion for leave to file an untimely amended Rule 61\nmotion. (D.I. 10-1 at Entry Nos. 58-68) On October 5, 2016, the Superior Court\ngranted the motion for leave to file an untimely amended Rule 61 motion, and\nordered that the amended Rule 61 motion must be filed by October 20, 2016. (DI.\n10-1 at Entry No. 60) In March 2017, the prothonotary was unable to locate the\nRule 61 motion and motion to file an untimely Rule 61 motion that substitute post-\nconviction counsel had filed back in October 2016. (D.I. 10-1 at Entry No. 66)\nConsequently, on March 15, 2017, the Superior Court ordered the prothonotary to\n\naffix the time stamp of October 3, 2016 to the copies of the Rule 61 motion\n\nprovided by substitute counsel. (Jd.) The State filed a response to the October 3,\n2016 motion on July 31, 2017. (DI. 10-1 at Entry No. 70)\n\nOn March 28, 2018 a Superior Court Commissioner issued a Report\nrecommending that Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61motion be denied. The Superior Court\nadopted the Report and Recommendation on May 8, 2018 and denied the Rule 61\nmotion as procedurally barred and meritless. See Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at\n*5; (D.1. 10-1 at Entry No. 77; D.I. 10-13 at 4) The Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed that decision on May 20, 2019. See Thomas v. State, 211 A.3d 1074\n(Table), 2019 WL 2183830, at *1 (Del. May 20, 2019), corrected (June 5, 2019).\n\nOn October 10, 2019, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion. (D.I 10-1 at\nEntry Nos. 91 & 92; D.I. 10-18 at 9-16) The Superior Court summarily dismissed\nthe second Rule 61 motion on October 31, 2019 for being procedurally barred.\n(D.I. 10-18 at 7-8) Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration (D.I 10-1 at Entry\nNo. 95), which the Superior Court dismissed on November 21, 2019. (DI. 10-1 at\nEntry No. 96; 10-18 at 5-6) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior\nCourt\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s second Rule 61 motion on April 7, 2020. See\nThomas v. State, 228 A.3d 689 (Table), 2020 WL 1814047, at *1 (Del. Apr. 7,\n2020), rehr\u2019g en banc denied (May 14, 2020).\n\nBy letter dated October 8, 2019, Petitioner filed in this Court a form habeas\n\nPetition with attachments, asking the Court to stay and abey consideration of his\n6\nclaims while he attempted to exhaust state remedies in the Delaware state courts.\n(D.I 1) Petitioner filed a formal motion requesting a stay on October 10, 2019\n(D.1. 3), which the Honorable Leonard P. Stark granted on December 19, 2019.\n(D.I. 6) The first Petition asserts three claims: (1) miscarriage of justice based on\nnewly discovered evidence supporting his argument that his plea was coerced (D.I.\n1 at 5; D.I 1-1 at 5-6); (2) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance during\nthe plea process and on direct appeal for providing bad legal advice about the plea\nand conducting a faulty investigation into Petitioner\u2019s post-traumatic stress\ndisorder triggered in the presence of police (D.L. 1 at 5; D.I. 1-1 at 6-9); and (3)\ndefense counsel provided ineffective assistance and abandoned his duty of\nrepresentation by permitting Detective Lloyd to attend the pre-plea meeting with\nState because it created a coercive atmosphere that rendered Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea\ninvoluntary. (See D.I. 1-1 at 8; D.I.3 at 7 in C.A. 20-1361)\n\nOn October 7, 2020, upon the completion of his second Rule 61 proceeding\nin the Delaware state courts, Petitioner filed in this Court a completely new form\napplication for habeas relief and a memorandum in support without identifying his\nexisting case. The filing of those documents initiated the opening of a new habeas\ncase. (See DI. 1 and D.I. 3 in Thomas v. May, Civ. A. 20-1361-LPS) Upon\ndetermining that the October 2020 filings were intended to be filed in Petitioner\u2019s\n\noriginal habeas proceeding that had been stayed and, in effect, together constituted\n7\nPetitioner\u2019s notice that exhaustion was completed, the Court issued an Order for\nthe second habeas case to be administratively closed and the form application to be\nfiled in this proceeding as an Amended Petition. (D.I. 7) The Memorandum in\nSupport was not filed in the instant case at that time, and the State was only\nordered to respond to the claims raised in the first Petition and Amended Petition.\n(D.I. 9)\n\nThe Memorandum of Support that Petitioner filed in the now\nadministratively closed case supplements Petitioner\u2019s original arguments and\nessentially adds two arguments: (1) the State violated state court rules, professional\nrules of ethics, and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) by not informing the\nSuperior Court that Detective Lloyd attended the pre-plea meeting in the\ncourthouse holding area; and (2) defense counsel abandoned Petitioner at a critical\nstage of his criminal proceeding in violation of United States v. Cronic 466 U.S.\n648 (1984) by permitting Detective Lloyd to be present at the pre-plea meeting,\nand the Superior Court erred by not analyzing the ineffective assistance of counsel\nargument he presented in his first Rule 61 proceeding pursuant to Cronic. (D.I.3\nat 3-17 in Thomas, Civ. A. 20-1361-LPS). Thus, after reviewing the first Petition,\nAmended Petition, and Memorandum in Support (See Thomas, Civ. A. 20-1361-\nLPS) (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cPetition\u2019\u201d), the Court views Petitioner\n\nas having raised the following four Claims: (1) defense counsel provided\n8\nineffective assistance during the plea process by failing to investigate Petitioner\u2019s\npost-traumatic stress disorder that is triggered by being around police officers (D.I.\n1-1 at 8); (2) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance and/or abandoned his\nduty of representation by permitting Detective Lloyd to attend the pre-plea meeting\nwith the State because the Detective\u2019s presence, in combination with the\nprosecutor\u2019s actions, created a coercive atmosphere that rendered Petitioner\u2019s\nguilty plea involuntary (See D.I. 1-1 at 8; DI. 3 at 7, 17 in Thomas, Civ. A. 20-\n1361-LPS), and the Superior Court erred during his first Rule 61 proceeding by\nfailing to review his ineffective assistance claim under Cronic (See D.I. 3 at 15-17\nin Thomas, Civ. A. 20-1361-LPS); (3) the State prosecutor violated Superior Court\nCriminal Rule 11(e)(2) and Professional Rule of Conduct Rule 3.8 by not\ninforming the Superior Court during his first Rule 61 proceeding that Detective\nLloyd was present at the pre-plea meeting (DI. 3 at 6 in Thomas, Civ. A. 20-1361-\nLPS); and (4) the State violated Brady during his Rule 61 proceeding by failing to\ndisclose evidence that Detective Lloyd was present at the pre-plea meeting (D.I. 3\nat 10 in Thomas, Civ. A. 20-1361-LPS). The Court views Petitioner\u2019s assertion of\nnewly discovered evidence/miscarriage of justice in his first Petition as an\nargument that he is entitled to a later starting date under AEDPA\u2019s statute of\n\nlimitations. (D.I. 1 at 5, 12)\nIl. ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal\nsentences... and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). AEDPA prescribes a one-year\nperiod of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which\nbegins to run from the latest of:\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time\nfor seeking such review;\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an\napplication created by State action in violation of the\n\nConstitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the\napplicant was prevented from filing by such State action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was\n\ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has\n\nbeen newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\n\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\n\nclaims presented could have been discovered through the\n\nexercise of due diligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and\nequitable tolling. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling);\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling).\n\n10\n\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court does not discern, any facts\ntriggering the application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) or (C). In his first Petition, however,\nPetitioner asserts that he has newly discovered evidence of the coercion leading to\nhis entering a guilty plea, and the circumstances surrounding the unavailability of\nthat evidence over the past years demonstrates that he has suffered a miscarriage of\njustice. More specifically, he has an \u201cInvestigative Report\u201d from O\u2019Rourke\nInvestigative Associates dated October 18, 2018 which confirms his story that the\ninvestigative police officer in his criminal case \u2014 Detective Jeremiah Lloyd \u2014 was\npresent at the pre-plea meeting that took place in the courthouse holding area prior\nto the final case review to discuss the charges against Petitioner. (D.I. 10-17 at 29)\nDuring Petitioner\u2019s first Rule 61 proceeding, defense counsel freely acknowledged\nthat he had called the meeting in the holding area with the prosecutor, Petitioner,\nand the defense team as part of the plea negotiation strategy, but explained that his\ndefense-team investigator \u2014- Gary K. Marshall \u2014 was the fourth attendee at the\nmeeting, not Detective Lloyd. (D.I. 10-8 at 159-63) One premise for Petitioner\u2019s\n\u201ccoerced plea\u201d claim, both in this proceeding and in his first Rule 61 proceeding,\nwas that Detective Lloyd\u2019s presence and actions during the meeting (combined\nwith the prosecutor\u2019s actions) amounted to coercion. The Superior Court rejected\nPetitioner\u2019s contention of coercion after finding defense counsel\u2019s version of the\n\nmeeting (asserted in his Rule 61 affidavit) to be more credible than Petitioner\u2019s\n11\n\nversion. See Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *4 (Commissioner stated \u201cI find Trial\nCounsel\u2019s affidavit in conjunction with the record, more credible than\n[Petitioner\u2019s] claims that his counsel\u2019 representation was ineffective.\u201d)\n\nHere, Petitioner appears to assert his \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d argument\nas a way to trigger a later starting for the limitations period under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).\nThe Court is not persuaded. Determining if a petitioner has exercised due\ndiligence for \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) purposes is context-specific, and the essential\nquestion is \u201cwhether the petitioner should be expected to take actions which would\nlead him to the information.\u201d Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 661-62 (3d Cir.\n2005). The later starting date under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) commences \u201cwhen the factual\npredicate of a claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence, not when it was actually discovered.\u201d Schlueter v. Varner, 384 F.3d 69,\n74 (3d Cir. 2004). While this standard does not require \u201cthe maximum feasible\ndiligence,\u201d it does require reasonable diligence in the circumstances, and a\npetitioner can only avail himself of a later accrual date \u201cif vital facts could not have\nbeen known.\u201d Id. Although Congress did not define the term \u201cfactual predicate\u201d as\nused in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)\\(D), the Third Circuit has defined \u201cfactual predicate\u201d as \u201cvital\nfacts underlying [petitioner's] claims.\u201d McAleese v. Brennan, 483 F.3d 206, 214\n(3d Cir. 2007). As further explained by the Second Circuit, \u201cif new information is\n\ndiscovered that merely supports or strengthens a claim that could have been\n12\n\nproperly stated without the discovery, that information is not a \u2018factual predicate\u2019\nfor purposes of triggering the statute of limitations under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).\u201d Rivas\nv. Fischer, 687 F.3d 514, 535 (2d Cir. 2012). Finally, when evaluating a\npetitioner\u2019s diligence, a court must consider that the \u201cstatute\u2019s clear policy calls for\npromptness.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S. 295, 311 (2005) (discussing 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2255(d)(4)).\n\nUnder these principles, if Petitioner\u2019s newly discovered evidence \u2014 the\nOctober 18, 2018 Investigative Report \u2014 is a \u201cfactual predicate\u201d of the Claims in\nthe Petition for \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) purposes, then October 18, 2018 (or the date on\nwhich Petitioner asked O\u2019Rourke Investigative Associates to conduct the\ninvestigation) would constitute the relevant starting date for the limitations period.\nNevertheless, after considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court\nconcludes Petitioner\u2019s receipt of the Investigative Report (or date of hiring\nO\u2019Rourke Investigative Associates) does not trigger a later starting date. For\ninstance, the information in the Report is not new. By his own admission,\nPetitioner has repeatedly stated over the years that Detective Lloyd was present at\nthe pre-plea meeting. Petitioner was also on notice that defense counsel did not\nrecall Detective Lloyd being present at the meeting when defense counsel filed his\nRule 61 affidavit in the Superior Court on May 3, 2017 (during Petitioner\u2019s Rule\n\n61 proceeding). (D.I. 10-1 at Entry No. 68) And, the prosecutor\u2019s response to the\n13\nRule 61 motion filed on July 31, 2017 omitted the presence of Detective Lloyd at\nthe meeting. (D.I. 10-8 at 164-173)\n\nAdditionally, Petitioner has not explained how diligently he pursued the\ninformation corroborating his assertion that Detective Lloyd was present at the\nmeeting. There is no reason to believe Detective Lloyd would not have provided\nthe relevant information at any point in time had he been asked to do so.\n\nGiven this record, the Court concludes that the Investigative Report does not\ntrigger a later starting date of October 2018 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Consequently,\nthe one-year period of limitations began to run when Petitioner\u2019s convictions\nbecame final under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), ifa state prisoner appeals a state court\njudgment but does not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes\nfinal, and the statute of limitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day\ntime period allowed for seeking certiorari review. See Kapral v. United States, 166\nF.3d 565, 575, 578 (3d Cir. 1999); Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir.\n1999). In this case, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction\non November 9, 2012, and he did not seek review by the United States Supreme\nCourt. As a result, his judgment of conviction became final on February 8, 2013.\nApplying the one-year limitations period to that date, Petitioner had until February\n\n8, 2014 to timely file a habeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64\n14\n\n(3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period);\nPhlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015)\n(AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is calculated according to the anniversary\nmethod, i.e., the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the date it began\nto run). Petitioner, however, did not file the instant Petition until October 8, 20 19,?\nmore than five years after that deadline. Thus, the Petition is time-barred and\nshould be dismissed, unless the limitations period can be statutorily or equitably\ntolled, or Petitioner makes a gateway showing of actual innocence. See Jones, 195\nF.3d at 158; see Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F.4\" 133, 151 d Cir. 2021) (explaining\nthat actual innocence is an \u201cexception to the statute of limitations\u201d rather than an\n\u201cextension to the statute of limitations via equitable tolling.\u201d). The Court will\ndiscuss each doctrine in turn.\n\nA. Statutory Tolling\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls\n\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state\n\n2The Petition is not dated, and there is no certificate of service. Petitioner did,\nhowever, include a cover letter with his Petition that is dated October 8, 2019.\n(D.I. 1-2 at 1) Pursuant to the prison mailbox rule, the Court adopts October 8,\n2019 as the filing date. See Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761 (3d Cir.\n2003) (the date on which a prisoner transmitted documents to prison authorities for\nmailing is to be considered the actual filing date).\n\n15\ncourts, including any post-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed\nand pending before the expiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v.\nMeyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A post-conviction motion is\n\u201c* properly filed\u2019 for statutory tolling purposes when its delivery and acceptance is\nin compliance with the state\u2019s applicable laws and rules governing filings, such as\nthe form of the document, any time limits upon its delivery, the location of the\nfiling, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d Crump v. Phelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D.\nDel. 2008). The limitations period is also tolled for the time during which an\nappeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed even ifthe appeal is not\neventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. The limitations period, however, is\nnot tolled during the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state\npost-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att\u2019y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539,\n542 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\nPetitioner filed his first Rule 61 motion on October 3, 2016,? more than two\nyears after AEDPA\u2019s limitations period expired on February 8, 2014. Therefore,\n\nneither of Petitioner\u2019s two Rule 61 motions have any statutory tolling effect.\n\n3The motion for an extension of time to file a Rule 61 motion that Petitioner filed\nin the Superior Court on September 26, 2013 does not trigger statutory tolling,\nbecause it was not a \u201cproperly filed\u201d post-conviction motion for the purposes of \u00a7\n2244(d)(2).\n\n16\nB. Equitable Tolling\n\nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare\ncircumstances when the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\nand prevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the\ndiligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to\nthe petitioner\u2019s excusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. Additionally, the obligation to\nact diligently \u201cdoes not pertain solely to the filing of the federal habeas petition,\nrather it is an obligation that exists during the period [the petitioner] is exhausting\nstate court remedies as well.\u201d LaCava v. Kyler, 398 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 2005).\nAs for the extraordinary circumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not\nwhether the circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner,\nbut how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year\ndeadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An\nextraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \u201ca causal\nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the\npetitioner\u2019s failure to file a timely federal petition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784,\n803 (3d. Cir. 2013).\n\nPetitioner contends that equitable tolling is warranted because his delay in\n\nfiling the instant Petition was due to the State\u2019s refusal to provide him access to the\n17\nevidence of who was present at the cell block on the date of his guilty plea. (D-IL.\n14 at 6, 14) He alleges that he needed the information about who attended the pre-\nplea meeting in the cell block to exhaust state remedies for all of the claims he\nplanned to bring in one complete federal habeas petition. (D.I. 14 at 16) This\nargument is unavailing. Petitioner had personal knowledge about the events of the\npre-plea meeting, and has failed to explain why he was unable to file a protective\nhabeas petition in this Court and request a stay while he was pursuing a way to\nsupport his claims. The fact that Petitioner requested a stay (which was granted)\nwhen he filed his first federal habeas petition in 2019 demonstrates his awareness\nof the \u201cprotective stay\u201d method of complying with the statute of limitations.\n\nThe Court also does not view the Superior Court\u2019s action of granting\nPetitioner\u2019s motion to extend the time to file his first Rule 61 motion on November\n15, 2013 as an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling. After\ngranting the motion to extend the time of filing, the Superior Court appointed two\ndifferent attorneys to represent Petitioner who, for some reason, did not file a Rule\n61 motion until October 3, 2016. Even if the delay in filing the Rule 61 motion\nwas due to post-conviction counsel\u2019s ignorance of Delaware\u2019s state postconviction\nprocedures, this type of attorney error does not amount to an extraordinary\ncircumstance for equitable tolling purposes. See Fahy v. Horn, 240 F.3d 239, 244\n\n\u201cIn non-capital cases, attorney error miscalculation, inadequate research, or other\n2\n18\n\nmistakes have not been found to rise to the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances required\nfor equitable tolling.\u201d). Given these circumstances, the Court concludes that\nequitable tolling is not available to Petitioner on the facts he has presented.\n\nC. Actual Innocence\n\nFinally, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable\nexception\u201d that can overcome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period.\nSee McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4\" at 150-151.\nPetitioner, however, does not assert any claim of actual innocence.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Court concludes that the Petition is time-barred.\nNevertheless, the statute of limitations defense is not a jurisdictional bar for habeas\ncases\u2018 and, given the murkiness surrounding the contradictory information revealed\nby the Investigative Report and the fact that the State has provided alternative\narguments for finding Petitioner\u2019s arguments procedurally barred and/or meritless,\nthe Court finds it prudent to address the State\u2019s additional arguments.\n\nIl. PROCEDURAL DEFAULT\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\n\nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law.\n\n4See Holland, 560 U.S. at 645.\n19\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999);\nPicard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\n\nshall not be granted unless it appears that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in\nthe courts of the State; or\n\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective\n\nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such\n\nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of\ncomity, gives \u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues\nby invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review\nprocess.\u201d O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192\n(3d Cir. 2000).\n\nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the\nhabeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either on direct\nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the\ncourt to consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451\nn.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised\n\nthe issue on direct appeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted\n\nand the petitioner does not need to raise the same issue again in a state post-\n\n20\n\nconviction proceeding. See Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir.\n1997).\n\nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and\nfurther state court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the\nfederal court will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted.\nSee Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \u201cmeet[]\nthe technical requirements for exhaustion\u201d because state remedies are no longer\navailable); see also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims,\nhowever, are procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v.\nLarkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a\nhabeas claim to the state\u2019s highest court, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d\nrefuses to review the merits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state\nprocedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman,\n501 US. at 750, Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims\nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual\nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will\nresult if the court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172\nF.3d 255, 260 (3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause\n\nfor a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor\n21\nexternal to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s\nprocedural rule.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate\nactual prejudice, a petitioner must show that the errors during his trial created more\nthan a possibility of prejudice; he must show that the errors worked to his actual\nand substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional\ndimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \u201cconstitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u201d* then a federal\ncourt can excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451\n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). The miscarriage of\njustice exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means\n\nfactual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 US.\n\n614, 623 (1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual\ninnocence by asserting \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory\nscientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical\nevidence\u2014that was not presented at trial,\u201d showing that no reasonable juror would\n\nhave voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Hubbard v.\n\nsMurray, 477 U.S. at 496.\n22\nPinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not present Claims One, Three, and\nFour in his first Rule 61 motion. Instead, Petitioner presented Claim One to the\nDelaware courts for the first time in his second Rule 61 motion. The Superior\nCourt summarily dismissed Claim One as procedurally barred under Rule 61(d)(2)\nand also as independently time-barred under Rule 61(i)(1) and Rule 61(i)(3). (D.I.\n10-18 at 7-8) On appeal from that decision, Petitioner re-asserted Claim One\n(defense counsel did not investigate his PTSD) and, for the first time, presented\nClaim Three (prosecutor violated Superior Court Criminal Rule 11(e)(2) and\nProfessional Rule of Conduct 3.8) as a new argument. (D.L. 10-17 at 9-11) The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s\nsecond Rule 61 motion \u201con the basis of and for the reasons assigned by the\nSuperior Court\u2019s orders dated October 31, 2019 and November 21, 2019.\u201d\nThomas, 2020 WL 1814047, at *1.\n\nBy applying the procedural bar of Rule 61(d)(2), Rule 61(i)(1), and Rule\n\n61(i)(3), the Superior Court articulated a \u201cplain statement\u201d under Harris v. Reed\nthat its decision rested on state law grounds. This Court has consistently held that\n\nRules 61(i)(1) and (3) are independent and adequate state procedural rules\n\n23\n\neffectuating a procedural default.\u00b0 See Trice v. Pierce, 2016 WL 2771123, at *4\n(D. Del. May 13, 2016). Therefore, the Court cannot review the merits of Claims\nTwo and Three absent a showing of cause for the default, and prejudice resulting\ntherefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the claim is\nnot reviewed.\n\nIn turn, the record reveals that Petitioner did not present Claim Four\n(alleging that the State violated Brady by not providing evidence of Detective\nLloyd\u2019s presence at the pre-plea meeting) to the Delaware state courts in either of\nhis Rule 61 proceedings. At this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to raise the\nClaims in a new Rule 61 motion would be barred as untimely under Delaware\nSuperior Court Rule 61(i)(1) and as second or successive under Rule 61(i)(2). See\nDel. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1) (establishing a one-year deadline for filing Rule\n61 motions); Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(2) (providing that second or successive\nmotions shall be summarily dismissed unless they meet the pleading requirements\nof Rule 61(d)(2)(i) or (ii)). Although Rule 61 provides for an exception to its\n\nprocedural bars if a Rule 61 motion \u201casserts a retroactively applicable right that is\n\n\u00aeAithough the State correctly asserts that \u201cthis Court recently confirmed that Rule\n61(d)(2) is an adequate state procedural rule precluding federal habeas [review],\u201d\n(D.L 11 at 26), that decision was made \u201cas applied\u201d to the particular Petitioner\u2019s\nsituation. In this case, the Superior Court\u2019s reliance on Rule 61(i)(1) and (3), and\nthe Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of that reliance, satisfies the procedural\ndefault analysis.\n\n24\nnewly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\u201d no such right is\nimplicated in the instant Claims. Similarly, the exceptions to the bars contained in\nRule 61(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner\u2019s case, because he does not\nallege actual innocence, lack of jurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law\napplies to Claim Four.\n\nThe foregoing analysis demonstrates that Claims One, Three, and Four are\nprocedurally defaulted, which means that the Court cannot review their merits\nabsent a showing of either cause and prejudice or that a miscarriage of justice will\nresult absent such review. Even if Petitioner\u2019s contention that he did not have\n\u201cproof? supporting his statement that Detective Lloyd attended the pre-plea\nmeeting until he obtained the October 18, 2018 Investigative Report could\nconstitute cause \u2014 which the Court does not conclude \u2014 Petitioner cannot\ndemonstrate prejudice. As discussed below, Petitioner\u2019s argument that defense\ncounsel abandoned him in violation of Cronic, or that defense counsel provided\nineffective assistance by creating a coercive environment rendering his guilty plea\ninvoluntary, lacks merit.\n\nPetitioner also has not satisfied the miscarriage of justice exception to the\nprocedural default doctrine because he has not provided new reliable evidence of\nhis actual innocence. Thus, Claims One, Three, and Four are procedurally barred\n\nfrom habeas review.\n25\nIV. MERITS ANALYSIS: CLAIM TWO\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the\nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28\nUSS.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted\nif the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn,\n250 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2001). A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d\nfor the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision finally resolved the claim\non the basis of its substance, rather than on a procedural or some other ground. See\nThomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. 2009). The deferential standard of \u00a7\n2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by an opinion\nexplaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86,\n98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cit may be presumed that the state\ncourt adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-\nlaw procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d Id. at 99.\n\nWhen reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the state\n\ncourt's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This\n26\n\npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact,\nand is only rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See \u00a7\n2254(e)(1); Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard\nin \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application\nstandard of \u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).\n\nA. State Courts Adjudicated Claim Two On The Merits\n\nIn his initial Rule 61 motion, Petitioner presented two claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel: (1) defense counsel was ineffective for arranging a face-to-\nface meeting with the prosecuting attorney and an individual whom Petitioner\nbelieved was the State\u2019s chief investigating officer (Detective Lloyd) prior to\nrequiring that Petitioner make a life-defining decision as to plead guilty or insist\nupon going to trial; and (2) defense counsel was ineffective in that he erroneously\nexecuted and had Petitioner execute a plea agreement that contained a\nrecommendation for \u201copen sentencing\u201d and a P.S.I. because, under the terms of the\nplea agreement, the Court was required to sentence Petitioner to at least 24 years at\nLevel V. (D.I. 10-8 at 25, 29) To support his first allegation of ineffective\nassistance (coercion), Petitioner stated that \u201c[a]nother factor which impacted [his]\nmindset during and following the impromptu meeting (and ultimate decision to\n\naccept the plea offer) was his abject fear of police officers,\u201d and he indicated that\n27\n\nhe had been or was planning to be evaluated for posttraumatic stress syndrome\n(PSTD). (D.I. 10-8 at 22)\n\nThe Superior Court Commissioner interpreted these two arguments as\nfreestanding claims, with ineffective assistance being alleged to constitute cause\nfor failing to assert the freestanding claims in the proceedings leading to the\njudgment of conviction. See Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *3 (stating \u201cNone of\n[Petitioner\u2019s] claims were specifically raised at the plea, sentencing, or on direct\nappeal.\u201d). The Commissioner denied the claims as procedurally barred under Rule\n61(i)(3) for failure to raise them in the proceedings leading to Petitioner\u2019s\njudgment of conviction after finding that Petitioner did not demonstrate cause \u2014 the\nalleged ineffective assistance \u2014 and prejudice. See Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at\n*3-5. The Superior Court adopted the Commissioner\u2019s Report and\nRecommendation, specifically noting:\n\n[With respect to [Petitioner\u2019s] two stated bases for his\nmotion: (1) [Petitioner] was fully advised by trial counsel\nregarding the nature and purpose of the pre-plea meeting\nwith opposing counsel, and the meeting resulted in a\nfurther reduction of the State\u2019s plea offer, and (2)\n[Petitioner] was fully informed by trial counsel regarding\nthe inadvisability of requesting a presentence\ninvestigation.\u201d\n\n(D.I. 10-13 at 4) The Superior Court concluded by denying Petitioner\u2019s first Rule\n\n61 motion \u201cas procedurally barred and completely meritless.\u201d (D.I. 10-3 at 4)\n\n28\nPetitioner appealed the Superior Court\u2019s decision to the Delaware Supreme\nCourt. On appeal, Petitioner omitted his \u201copen sentencing\u201d argument and\npresented only one claim for relief: his guilty plea was involuntary because\ndefense counsel arranged a meeting prior to his plea with the prosecutor and\nsomeone whom Petitioner believed was the State\u2019s chief investigating officer in his\ncase \u2014 Detective Lloyd \u2014 and both individuals \u201cbombarded [him] with taunts,\nchallenge[s] and insults.\u201d (D.I. 10-11 at 25) Petitioner argued that the\ncircumstances of the meeting amounted to duress and coercion, because the\nremarks offered by the prosecutor and the individual Petitioner believed was\nDetective Lloyd left Petitioner believing he had no choice but to accept the plea\noffer that was extended to him. (D.I. 10-11 at 25) After the State filed its\nresponse, Petitioner received the October 2018 Investigative Report. (D.I. 10-14 at\n19) He sought, and received, permission from the Delaware Supreme Court to file\nan out-of-time reply brief in order to present the Investigative Report and further\nhis contention that his guilty plea was coerced. (/d.) In his reply brief, Petitioner\nargued that the \u201cinformation contained in the Investigative Report is a paramount\nimportance to [Petitioner\u2019s] claim insofar as it contradicts information previously\nimparted to the Superior Court, and at the same time bolsters [Petitioner\u2019s]\ncredibility with respect to his assertion of duress.\u201d (Id. at 21) Petitioner contended\n\nthat\n29\nthe Superior Court abused its discretion by affording little\n\nto no weight (and essentially rejecting altogether)\n\n[Petitioner\u2019s] assertions, and by disregarding the impact of\n\n[the prosecutor] and Detective Lloyd at the meeting had\n\nupon [Petitioner\u2019s] psyche. Additionally, the Superior\n\nCourt seems to have essentially denied [Petitioner\u2019s]\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim based upon a\n\ncredibility contest.\n(D.I. 10-14 at 22)\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the denial of Petitioner\u2019s first Rule\n\n61 motion \u201cfor the reasons assigned by the Superior Court in the Commissioner\u2019s\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law dated March 28, 2108, and the\nSuperior Court\u2019s order adopting the Commissioner\u2019s report dated May 8, 2018.\nThomas, 2019 WL 2183830, at *1. Ina footnote, the Delaware Supreme Court\nexplained that the Rule 61 motion was time-barred, but stated that it had\nconsidered Petitioner\u2019s \u201ccoerced guilty plea claim\u201d on the merits. See Thomas,\n2019 WL 2183830, at *1 n.1. The Delaware Supreme Court also explained that it\nhad considered the Investigative Report and concluded that it \u201chad no bearing on\nthe Superior Court\u2019s conclusion\u201d that Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary. Td.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts\n\nadjudicated Claim Two on the merits. Consequently, Petitioner will only be\n\n30\nentitled to habeas relief if the Delaware state court\u2019 decisions were either contrary\nto, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\nB. Applicable Supreme Court Precedent\n\nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU.S. 510 (2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate\nthat \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d\nwith reasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time\ncounsel rendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second\nStrickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s error the result would have been different.\u201d Id.\nat 687-96. A reasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome.\u201d Jd, at 688. In the context of a guilty plea, a petitioner\n\n7Because the Superior Court provides a more in-depth analysis of Petitioner\u2019s\ninstant ineffective assistance of counsel Claims, the Court will refer to both state\ncourt decisions when reviewing these Claims. See Wilson v. Sellers, 138 S. Ct.\n1188, 1193-94 (2018) (reiterating that when a higher court affirms a lower court\u2019s\njudgment without an opinion or other explanation, federal habeas law employs a\n\u201clook through\u201d presumption and assumes that the later unexplained order\nupholding a lower court\u2019s reasoned judgment rests upon the same grounds as the\nlower court judgment).\n\n31\nsatisfies Strickland\u2019s prejudice prong by demonstrating that, but for counsel's error,\nthere is a reasonable probability that he would have insisted on proceeding to trial\ninstead of pleading guilty. See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). A court\nmany deny an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by only deciding one of the\nStrickland prongs. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697.\n\nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner\nmust make concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk\nsummary dismissal. See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991);\nDooley v. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not\ninsurmountable, the Strickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \u201cstrong\npresumption that the representation was professionally reasonable.\u201d Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 689.\n\nHowever, in United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), the United States\nSupreme Court articulated a limited exception to Strickland\u2019s requirement that a\npetitioner must demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice in order to\nprevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, holding that there are three\nsituations in which prejudice caused by an attorney's performance will be\npresumed: where the defendant is completely denied counsel at a critical stage;\nwhere \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful\n\nadversarial testing;\u201d or where the circumstances are such that there is an extremely\n32\n\nsmall likelihood that even a competent attorney could provide effective assistance,\nsuch as when the opportunity for cross-examination has been eliminated. See\nCronic, 466 U.S. at 659 & n.25. The Cronic presumption of prejudice only applies\nwhen counsel has completely failed to test the prosecution's case throughout the\nentire proceeding. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 697 (2002).\n\nPetitioner contends that the Delaware state courts should have reviewed\nClaim Two under the presumed-prejudice standard of Cronic. (D.I. 3 at 7-8 in\nThomas, Civ. A. 20-1361-LPS) He asserts that the Investigative Report supports\nhis argument that defense counsel\u2019s actions during the pre-plea meeting in the\nholding cell constituted an abandonment of his representation at a critical stage of\nthe proceeding. (/d.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s reliance on Cronic is misplaced. Although the term \u201cabandon\u201d\nwas used once or twice in his Rule 61 motion (See 10-8 at 22, 28), Petitioner did\nnot fairly present an actual or constructive denial of counsel claim under Cronic to\nthe Delaware state courts. Consequently, Petitioner\u2019s Cronic argument is\nprocedurally defaulted. Even if the Court were to consider Petitioner\u2019s Cronic\n\u201ccomplete denial of counsel\u201d argument, relief is only available when \u201cwhen\ncounsel was either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a\ncritical stage of the proceeding.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659, n. 25. Here, defense\n\ncounsel was neither totally absent nor in some way prevented from assisting\n33\n\nPetitioner. Id. During the plea process, defense counsel met with Petitioner on\nmultiple occasions, reviewed the applicable law and facts of the case with\nPetitioner, and provided examples of three possible plea offers the State may\nextend along with possible related penalties. (D.I. 10-8 at 19-20, 159-162) In\naddition, the transcript of Petitioner\u2019s plea hearing demonstrates that defense\ncounsel actively represented Petitioner during the plea colloquy. (D.I. 10-2 at 19-\n31) Thus, the Delaware state courts did not unreasonably apply federal law by\nfailing to reviewing Claim Two under Cronic.\n\nC. Section 2254(d) Review\n\nHaving determined that Cronic is inapplicable, the Court finds that the\nSuperior Court correctly identified and articulated the Strickland/Hill standard as\ngoverning Petitioner\u2019s instant ineffective assistance of counsel contention.\u00ae Asa\nresult, the Superior Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established\nSupreme Court precedent. See Fahy v. Horn, 516 F.3d 169, 196 (3d Cir. 2008)\n(Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly\nestablished Federal law because appropriately relied on its own state court cases,\n\nwhich articulated the proper standard derived from Supreme Court precedent);\n\n\u2018The Superior Court cited to Strickland without citing Hill. Nevertheless, the\nstandard the Superior Court articulated correctly stated the standard set forth in\nboth Strickland and Hill.\n\n34\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A] run-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the\ncorrect legal rule from [Supreme Court] cases to the facts of a prisoner's case\n[does] not fit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause\u201d).\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Superior Court reasonably applied the\nStrickland/Hill standard to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case. When performing this\ninquiry, the Court must review the court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s ineffective\nassistance of counsel allegations through a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens. See\nHarrington, 562 U.S. at 105-06. \u201c[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions\nwere reasonable, [but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that\ncounsel satisfied Strickland\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d Jd. When assessing prejudice\nunder Strickland, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would\nhave been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s performance, and the \u201clikelihood of a\ndifferent result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d Jd. And finally, when\nviewing a state court\u2019s determination that a Strickland claim lacks merit through\nthe lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief is precluded \u201cso long as fairminded\njurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d Jd. at 101.\n\nIn his Rule 61 proceeding, Petitioner argued that defense counsel was\nineffective for arranging a face-to-face meeting on the morning of his final case\nreview which included the prosecutor and an individual Petitioner believed was the\n\nState\u2019s chief investigating officer, Detective Lloyd. (D.I. 10-14 at 8 n. 24)\n35\n\nPetitioner contended that he suffers from PTSD as a result of being shot by police\nwhen he was trying to avoid arrest. Since Detective Lloyd was at the scene of the\nshooting, Petitioner asserted that he was placed under duress and felt intimidated\nby being in the presence of an individual he believed was Detective Lloyd. He\nalso asserted that both the prosecutor and the individual he believed to be Detective\nLloyd \u201cbombarded [him] with taunts, challenge[s], and insults.\u201d (D.I. 10-14 at 21)\nPetitioner argued that the duress he was under during the meeting caused him to\nrelent to defense counsel\u2019s suggestion that he enter a plea agreement and,\ntherefore, despite what the transcript of the plea colloquy may indicate, the plea\noffer was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered. (D.I. 10-14 at 8 n.\n24)\n\nThe Superior Court Commissioner denied Claim Two after determining that\nPetitioner failed to satisfy both prongs of the Strickland standard. The\nCommissioner based her conclusion that defense counsel\u2019s act of arranging the\nmeeting in the holding cell, and his actions during that meeting, did not constitute\ndeficient performance under Stricklana\u2019s first prong on two determinations: (1)\ndefense counsel\u2019s version of who attended the meeting and what happened during\nthe meeting was more credible than Petitioner\u2019s version; and (2) Petitioner was\nbound by his statements during the plea colloquy that he was satisfied with defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s representation. See Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *4. The\n36\n\nCommissioner found \u201ccounsel\u2019s representations [in his Rule 61 affidavit] far more\ncredible than [Petitioner\u2019s] self-serving, vague allegations\u201d and that Petitioner\n\u201cha[d] failed to allege any facts sufficient to substantiate his claim that is attorney\nwas ineffective.\u201d Thomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *4. Defense counsel\u2019s Rule 61\naffidavit provided the following information:\n\nPrior to the Final Case Review, I and Mr. Gary K. Marshall\nof Shore Investigations met with [Petitioner] on numerous\noccasions at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in\nSmyrna. Mr. Robert C. Collins, II, Esq., co-counsel, also\noccasionally attended these meetings. The purpose of\nthese meetings was to discuss potential plea options as\nwell as trial strategy, should the case go to trial. We also\ndiscussed the ramifications and pitfalls of taking a plea\nthat involved a Pre-sentence Investigation (\u201cPSI\u201d).\n[Petitioner] knew all three members of his defense team\non a first-name basis. Mr. Marshall had also met with him\nindividually on more than one occasion. [Petitioner] knew\nexactly who Mr. Marshall was and what his role was on\nhis defense team.\n\nThe meeting between [the prosecutor] and [Petitioner] and\nhis defense team was not impromptu. I, Mr. Collins, and\nMr. Marshall jointly met with [Petitioner] in the holding\narea at the beginning of his Final Case Review. I explained\nto [Petitioner] what [the prosecutor] was offering in terms\nof a plea. [Petitioner] was not interested in a plea involving\n26-years of Level V time. We again discussed the\npossibility of bringing [the prosecutor] down to the\nholding area to speak to him. I explained that sometimes,\nwhen prosecutors meet defendants face-to-face, they tend\nto lighten up with respect to their plea offers. [Petitioner]\nand his defense team agreed that this might be a good\ncourse of action to take. And of note, [the prosecutor] did\nreduce her plea offer from 26 years down to 24 years\n\n37\nsubsequent to this meeting.\n\nOK OK\n\nAt the meeting, [the prosecutor] was direct in her\ncomments to [Petitioner] regarding his chosen lifestyle\nand penchant for criminal activity. Again though, it was\nnot the time to argue with [the prosecutor] or to challenge\nwhat she said. The time for that was during further plea\nnegotiations. And Mr. Marshall never injected himself into\n[the prosecutor\u2019s] comments. He did join in on the\nconversation after she departed.\n\nwe ok ok\n\nRegarding the GROUNDS FOR RELIEF section of\n[Petitioner\u2019s] Motion for Postconviction Relief I submit\nthe following:\n\n1. Ground One [(Ineffective Assistance of Counsel for\nArranging Meeting with Prosecutor)]. Denied. As\npreviously stated, the meeting with the prosecutor was\ndiscussed with [Petitioner] well before hand. The goal of\nthe meeting was to get the prosecutor to reduce the\nLevel V time she was asking for in her plea offer. She\ndid reduce her offer from 26 years down to 24 years.\nUnfortunately, [Petitioner] took offense to what she\nsaid at the meeting and from that point on refused to\naccept anything she offered that did not involve a PSI,\ndespite our very strong warnings to the contrary. And\nagain, [Petitioner] knew [Mr.] Marshall of Shore\nInvestigations on a first-name basis.\n\n(D.I. 10-8 at 159-63) (emphasis added). The Commissioner concluded that\ndefense counsel\u2019s actions \u201cwere extremely reasonable under all the circumstances,\n\nespecially in light of the overwhelming evidence against [Petitioner],\u201d and noted\n\n38\nthat Petitioner had admitted his guilt several times during his plea colloquy. See\nThomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *4.\n\nAfter concluding that defense counsel\u2019s representation was not ineffective\nunder the first prong of the Strickland test, the Commissioner also concluded that\nPetitioner did not satisfy the second (prejudice) prong of the test. The\nCommissioner opined:\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that counsel's representation of\n\n[Petitioner] was somehow deficient, [Petitioner] must\n\nsatisfy the second prong of the Strickland test, prejudice.\n\nIn setting forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\na defendant must make concrete allegations of actual\n\nprejudice and substantiate them or risk dismissal. In an\n\nattempt to show prejudice, [Petitioner] simply asserts that\n\nhis counsel was ineffective and speculates that he \u201cmay\u201d\n\nhave been given a more favorable plea. Instead he was\n\ngiven a better plea and he himself chose not to accept it\n\nand risk a presentence investigation. His statements are\n\ninsufficient to establish prejudice, particularly in light of\n\nthe overwhelming evidence against him. Therefore, I find\n\n[Petitioner\u2019] grounds for relief are meritless.\nThomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *4. The Commissioner then considered\nPetitioner\u2019s contention that his guilty plea was coerced by reviewing the transcript\nof the guilty plea colloquy and Truth-in-Sentencing Guilty Plea Form. Jd. at *5\nThe Commissioner found that Petitioner was bound by the statements he made\n\nduring the plea colloquy because he did not provide any clear and convincing\n\nevidence to the contrary, and held that Petitioner entered his guilty plea knowingly\n\n39\nand voluntarily. Jd. The Superior Court adopted the Commissioner\u2019s findings and\ndenied Claim Two.\n\nIn this proceeding, Petitioner argues that the Commissioner and Superior\nCourt unreasonably determined the facts when concluding that defense counsel\u2019s\nactions satisfied the performance prong of Strickland, because that determination\nwas made without the benefit of the October 18, 2018 Investigative Report. (D.I. 1\nat 5) The Delaware Supreme Court addressed this contention when it affirmed the\nSuperior Court\u2019s denial of Claim Two, opining:\n\n[Petitioner] alleges that coercion occurred at a meeting\nshortly before his plea was entered. He alleges that the\nmeeting was attended by his attorney, the assigned\nprosecutor, the State's lead investigator, and himself. The\naffidavit of trial counsel filed in the postconviction\nproceedings in Superior Court stated that the meeting was\nattended by trial counsel, the prosecutor, [Petitioner] and\na defense investigator. The Superior Court accepted as fact\nthat the meeting attendance was as stated in trial counsel's\naffidavit. When [Petitioner] filed his reply brief in this\ncourt, he attached as an exhibit an investigation performed\nby O'Rourke Investigative Associates, Inc. which includes\nsummaries of interviews with the defense investigator and\nthe State's lead investigator which say the State's lead\ninvestigator, not the defense investigator, was the fourth\nperson at the meeting. The O'Rourke investigation was\ndone after the appeal in this case was filed. [Petitioner]\nargues that the O'Rourke report shows that his description\nof the meeting was correct and adds weight to his claim\nthat he was coerced into pleading guilty. We are satisfied,\nhowever, that the identity of the fourth attendee had no\nbearing on the Superior Court's conclusion that\n[Petitioner\u2019s] plea was entered knowingly, intelligently\n\n40\n\nand voluntarily, a conclusion we affirm after having\nconsidered [Petitioner\u2019s] reply brief and the O'Rourke\ninvestigation.\n\nThomas, 2019 WL 2183830, at *1 n.1.\n\nOn habeas review, the Court \u201cmust presume that state-court factual findings\n~ including its credibility findings \u2014 are correct unless the presumption is rebutted\nby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Vickers v. Sup\u2019t Graterford SCI, 858 F.3d 841,\n850 (3d Cir. 2017), as amended (July 18, 2017). While the Delaware Supreme\nCourt did not explicitly address the Superior Court\u2019s analysis for the separate\nStrickland prongs and, as such, did not explicitly address how the Investigative\nReport may have affected the Superior Court\u2019s credibility determination, its\nholding that Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing\ndemonstrates that the Delaware Supreme Court did not view the Investigative\nReport as rebutting the Superior Court\u2019s factual determination that defense\ncounsel\u2019s actions did not create a coercive or intimidating atmosphere. After\nreviewing the record, the Court finds that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined the facts when making both its explicit and implicit conclusions. For\ninstance, the Investigative Report does not substantiate Petitioner\u2019s assertions that\nhe was \u201cbombarded with taunts [and] challenged [with] insults that were thrust\nupon him\u201d by the prosecutor and Detective Lloyd. (D.I. 10-14 at 21) The Report\n\nalso does not indicate that Detective Lloyd or the prosecutor used any other\n41\ncoercive methods to obtain Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea. And, the Report does not\nsubstantiate Petitioner\u2019s contention that he suffers from PTSD in the presence of\npolice officers. Importantly, Petitioner\u2019s claim that he was coerced is belied by the\nfact that he insisted on changing the terms of the offer the State presented after the\nmeeting in the holding area to include a PSI, despite defense counsel\u2019s advocating\nagainst the PSI and for immediate sentencing.\n\nNevertheless, even if the Court were to assume that the Superior Court\nunreasonably determined the facts and unreasonably applied Strickland when\nconcluding that defense counsel\u2019s actions did not constitute deficient performance\nunder Strickland\u2019 s first prong, Petitioner\u2019s instant argument does not demonstrate\nthat the Superior Court unreasonably applied Strickland when concluding that\nPetitioner failed to satisfy the second (prejudice) prong of the Strickland/Hill\nstandard. As an initial matter, the Investigative Report only provides information\nabout the attendees at the meeting in the holding cell; it does not provide any\ninformation about what occurred during that meeting or remotely address what\noccurred during Petitioner\u2019s plea colloquy. More importantly, however, Petitioner\nhas failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he\nwould have rejected the State\u2019s plea offer and insisted on proceeding to trial. At\nthe time of his guilty plea, Petitioner had multiple pending cases and faced a\n\nminimum mandatory sentence of sixty-two years if conviction on all charges. See\n42\nThomas, 2018 WL 1580553, at *1. Petitioner does not assert he is actually\ninnocent, and the evidence of Petitioner\u2019s guilt was overwhelming based upon the\npolice surveillance of him and Detective Lloyd\u2019s controlled buy. Additionally,\nregardless of who attended the meeting, the meeting resulted in the prosecutor\nreducing the sentence recommendation contained in the original plea offer by two\nyears. Petitioner insisted on changing the terms of that plea offer to include a PSI\nin the hope of receiving a lower sentence, against defense counsel\u2019s advice. Yet,\ndefense counsel\u2019s suggestion that Petitioner meet with the prosecutor still resulted\nin a measurable benefit, because the State dropped numerous charges against\nPetitioner in exchange for his guilty plea.\n\nFurthermore, Petitioner has not provided any clear and convincing evidence\novercoming the presumptive truthfulness of his declarations to the Superior Court\nduring his plea colloquy. See Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 74 (1977)\n(\u201cSolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity,\u201d which\ncreates a \u201cformidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings.\u201d). During\nhis plea colloquy, the Superior Court asked Petitioner if \u201canyone forced [him] or\nthreatened [him] to enter into this pleas,\u201d and Petitioner answered that no one had\ndone so. (D.I. 10-2 at 26) Petitioner also confirmed his understanding that the\nSuperior Court was not bound by any agreement regarding sentencing he may have\n\nmade with the State or any agreement he may make with the State between the\n43\ncolloquy and sentencing. (D.I. 10-2 at 26) Petitioner also admitted he was guilty\nof the charges against him, and that he was aware of the maximum penalty for\nthose offenses. (D.I. 10-2 at 25) In his Truth-In-Sentencing Guilty Plea Form,\nPetitioner confirmed that he had \u201cfreely and voluntarily decided to plead guilty.\u201d\n(D.1. 10-6 at 3-5)\n\nAfter viewing Petitioner\u2019s presumptively valid statements in conjunction\nwith the evidence against him, the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed to\nestablish a reasonable probability that, but for Detective Lloyd\u2019s presence at the\nmeeting, or defense counsel\u2019s alleged errors during that meeting, he would have\nrejected the State\u2019s plea offer and insisted on proceeding to trial. Given this\ndetermination, the Court concludes that the Delaware state courts reasonably\napplied the Strickland/Hill standard in holding that Petitioner failed to demonstrate\nhe suffered actual prejudice as a result of defense counsel\u2019s actions. The Court\nfurther concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did not unreasonably apply\nStrickland to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case when finding that the \u201cnewly\ndiscovered\u201d information in the Investigative Report did not affect the\ndetermination that Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was not the result of coercion.\nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim Two for failing to satisfy the standard in \u00a7\n\n2254(d).\n\n44\nV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also\ndecide whether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2\n(2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when\na petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d by\ndemonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of\nthe constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief.\nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly,\nthe Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the instant Petition without\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing or issuing a certificate of appealability. The Court\n\nwill enter an order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n45\n"}
