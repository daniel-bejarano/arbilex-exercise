NEWMAN ,   : \n: \nPlaintiff,    : \n: \nv.     : Civil Action No. 21- 1509- RGA  \n: \nMR. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, et al.,  : \n: \nDefendant s.   : \nS\nhantell  D. Newman , Wilmington, Delaware .  Pro Se Plaintiff.  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nA\npril 7 , 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware1 ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \nPlaintiff  Shantell Newman  appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4 ).  She commenced this action on the basis of a \nfederal question and a \u201chuman right to choose.\u201d  (D.I. 2 at 3.)  T he Court proceeds to \nscreen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff sues Defendant s \u201cMr. Biden Administration \u201d and the\nBancroft  School  in Wilmington, Delaware.   She appears to bring this action on behalf of \nherself and her minor son who is disabled.  Plaintiff alleges that her son is unable to do \nvirtual lea rning due to the shortage of teachers.  She takes exception to a COVID \nvaccination mandate and alleges that it is \u201c a State right to r efuse vaccines under \nEmergency use. \u201d  Plaintiff fears retaliation from the President if she does not get \nvaccinated.  She seeks $500,000,000 in damages and an end to the vaccination \nmandate.    \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to /s/ Richard G. Andrews2 \n a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se , her \npleading is liberally construed and h er Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. at 94 .  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \n\u201cfantastic or delusional \u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursua nt to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.  2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantiv e \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 1 1.  3 \n  A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \n There are no allegations that Plaintiff  is a federal worker  or that any federal \nmandate requiring vaccines applies  to her.  Moreover, the \u201cMr. Biden Administration\u201d is \nimmune from su it to the extent Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the President in the performance \nof official duties.  See Franklin v. Massachusetts , 505 U.S. 788, 802 -03 (1992).   Finally, \nthe Complaint  contains no plausible allegations supporting a request for relief against \nPresident Biden or his administration.  \n The claim against the Bancroft School also fails.   The claims against it involve  \nPlaintiff\u2019s son and the education he receives there.  There are no allegations that Plaintiff \nattends the school. Rather, it is her son.   As a non- attorney, Plaintiff  may not act as an \nattorney for other individuals and may only represent her self in this court.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1654; see also Osei -Afriye v. The Medical College of Pennsylvania, 937 F.2d 876 (3d 4 Cir. 1991)  (non-lawyer appearing pro se may not act as attorney for his children).   The \nComplaint contains no cognizable claims for relief.  Therefore, it will be dismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  to the extent it \nalleges claims on behalf of Plaintiff pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i).  \nAmendment is futile.   To the extent it alleges claims on behalf of Plaintiff\u2019s son, the \nComplaint will be dismissed without prejudice.  \nAn ap propriate Order will be entered.  "}
