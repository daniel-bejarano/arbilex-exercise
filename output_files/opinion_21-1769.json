WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nPlaintiff HID Global Corporation (\"HID\") alleges that Defendant Vector Flow, Inc. \n(\"Vector Flow\") infringes United States Patent Nos. 8,234,704 (\"the '704 patent\") and 9,111,088 \n(\"the '088 patent\") (collectively, the \"Asserted Patents\"). D.I 113 at ,r 1.1 The Asserted Patents \n\"relate generally to physical security systems, and more specifically to a system for integrating \ndisparate security systems using a rules-based policy engine and normalized data format.\" See, \ne.g., '704 patent at 1 :24-27; '088 at 1 :23-26. \nBefore the Court is the issue of claim construction of multiple terms across the Asserted \nPatents. The Court has considered the parties' joint claim construction brief and the accompanying \nappendix. D.I. 152; D.I. 131-1. The Court held a Markman hearing on March 7, 2023 (the \n\"Markman,\" Tr. __J. \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. \nSumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides \nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention \"). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the \nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent \n1 The Court writes for the benefit of the parties and assumes their familiarity with this action. \n2 law.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although \nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary . Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. \n831,837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370,372 (1996)). \n\"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as \nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and \nprosecution history.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to \nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term \nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at \n1313. \n\"When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic \nevidence, including the claims themselves, the specification , and the prosecution history of the \npatent, which is usually dispositive. \" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted , \ncan ... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In \naddition, \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]\" Id. For example, \"the \npresence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the \nlimitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-15. \nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification , which \"is always highly \nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is \n3 also possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the \npatentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's \nlexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only \na single embodiment , [however ,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the \npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of \nmanifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., \n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be \nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language. \" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d \n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \nThe Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence.\" \nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.]\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Markman , 52 F.3d \nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic \nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n4 II. AGREED-UPON TERMS \nThe parties agreed upon the construction of one claim term~ \"Rule\" / \"rules\" in claims 11, \n14, and 15 of the '704 patent and claims 15-17 of the '088 patent is afforded its plain and ordinary \nmeaning. D.I. 152 at 13. The Court will adopt the agreed-upon construction. \nIII. DISPUTED TERMS \nA. \"sensor\" \nThe claim term \"sensor\" appears in claims 11-15 of the '704 patent and claim 15 of the \n'088 patent. The parties' competing proposed constructions for \"sensor\" are set out in the chart \nbelow: \nClaim Term HID's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"a device that responds to a physical \nstimulus and transmits a resulting \nsignal\" \n\"sensor\" Plain and ordinary meaning Alternatively: \"a device that \nresponds to a physical stimulus and \nmakes available resulting \ninformation\" \nThe crux of the parties' dispute is whether \"sensor\" is limited to a device that only responds \nto physical stimuli, as opposed to non-physical stimuli. HID contends that that the term \"sensor\" \nhas a plain and ordinary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art and, thus, declines to \nproffer a construction. D.I. 152 at 14. Vector Flow disagrees , arguing that \"sensor\" must be \nconstrued by the Court \"because HID erroneously seeks to expand its meaning to encompass \ndevices that are not sensors.\" Id. at 17. Rather, Vector Flow asserts that, based on the intrinsic \nevidence, and corroborated by extrinsic technical dictionaries, \"sensor\" means \"a device that \nresponds to a physical stimulus and transmits a resulting signal.\" Id. at 15-17. \n5 \"It is axiomatic that we will not narrow a claim term beyond its plain and ordinary meaning \nunless there is support for the limitation in the words of the claim, the specification, or the \nprosecution history.\" 3M Innovative Props. Co. v. Tredegar Corp., 725 F.3d 1315, 1333 (Fed. \nCir. 2013) ( citations omitted). \"If the intrinsic record supports several definitions of a term, the \nterm may be construed to encompass all such consistent meanings.\" Wasica Fin. GmbH v. Cont'/ \nAuto. Sys., Inc., 853 F.3d 1272, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). \"Therefore , absent a \nclear disavowal or alternative lexicography by a patentee, he or she 'is free to choose a broad term \nand expect to obtain the full scope of its plain and ordinary meaning.\"' Id. at 1282 (quoting \nThorner, 669 F.3d at 1367). \nThe Court begins its analysis with the language of the claim itself. Use of the disputed \nterm in claim 11 of the '704 patent is instructive: \n11. A method comprising: \ninterfacing in a centralized security system, a plurality of security sensor types \ndistributed throughout a plurality of sites, each sensor type configured to \nrespond to a corresponding type of actionable event, each sensor type provided \nby a different manufacturer of a plurality of manufacturers; \naccepting sensor data from each security sensor an integration module \nincluding an agent for each type of security sensor, wherein the sensor data \nfrom each security sensor is embodied in a native data representation format \nof each respective manufacturer of the plurality of manufacturers; \ndefining individual user profiles and their respective access privileges and \ncredentials in the system; \nmapping the sensor data from each security sensor in the native data \nrepresentation format of each manufacturer of the plurality of manufacturers \nto a common data representation format, the common data representation \nformat including a data object and processing information for the sensor data; \nSee '704 patent at claim 11 ( emphases added). \n6 As HID argues, nothing in the language of the claims suggest that \"sensor\" is limited to \nonly those devices that respond to physical stimuli. D .I. 152 at 18-19. In fact, the claim language \nonly requires that each sensor be \"configured to respond to a corresponding type of actionable \nevent,\" not solely a physical \"type of actionable event.\" See '704 patent at claim 11. Moreover , \nthe claims themselves distinguish between a \"sensor\" and a \"physical sensor,\" which suggests that \nthe two terms have distinct meanings. See id. at claim 15 (\"The method of claim 11 further \ncomprising representing, through a visual editor, each normalized physical sensor as an object \ncontaining one or more attributes ... \"); see Andersen Corp. v. Fiber Composites , LLC, 474 F.3d \n1361, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (the doctrine of claim differentiation \"is based on the common sense \nnotion that different words or phrases used in separate claims are presumed to indicate that the \nclaims have different meanings and scope.\") ( quoting Karlin Tech. Inc. v. Surgical Dynamics , Inc., \n177 F.3d 968, 971-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Notably, the portion of the specification Vector Flow \nrelies on to bolster its proposed construction explains that \"[t]he system collects data and alarm \nevents from physical sensors, monitors and/or alarms distributed throughout the monitored \nfacilities,\" see '704 patent at 11 :63-66 ( emphasis added), which further suggests that \"sensor\" is a \nbroad term that is not limited exclusively to responding to physical stimuli. See Home Diagnostic s, \nInc. v. LifeScan, Inc., 381 F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (\"Absent a clear disavowal in the \nspecification or the prosecution history, the patentee is entitled to the Juli scope of its claim \nlanguage.\") ( emphasis added). \nMore so, and contrary to Vector Flow' s contention , the specification does not distinguish \nbetween the functionality of a \"sensor\" and the functionality of \"access controls, monitors, and \nalarms\" to suggest that \"sensor\" must be more than a device that responds to a stimulus. D.I. 152 \nat 15-16. Rather, these passages disclose that a \"sensor\"-as well as access controls, monitors, \n7 and alarms-can be a component of \"asset protection mechanisms, \" \"physical security systems \nand devices,\" and \"security elements,\" but do not otherwise indicate that every disclosed sensor \nmust respond exclusively to physical stimuli. See, e.g., '704 patent at 4:7-27, 10:60-61; '088 patent \nat 4:30-34. Indeed, even though the specifications of the Asserted Patents do not explicitly use the \nterm \"sensor\" when referring to non-physical stimuli, a person of ordinary skill in the art would \nreasonably rely on the specifications ' teachings of detecting software-based triggers to conclude \nthat \"sensor,\" in the context of the Asserted Patents, is not limited exclusively to responding to \nphysical stimuli. See, e.g., '704 patent at 4:15-18 (\"These can be independent elements that are \nconfigured to detect and report different types of events, such as fire, gas leaks, intrusion, computer \nhacking, physical proximity , and any other similar type of event.\"), id. at 12: 19-25; '088 Patent at \n4:34-37 (same); see also id. at 13:51-57. Again, this is consistent with the claim language , which \nonly requires that each sensor be \"configured to respond to a corresponding type of actionable \nevent,\" see '704 patent at claim 11, which can include \"computer hacking ... and any other similar \ntype of event.\" Id. at 4:15-18. Nor is there any intrinsic support for requiring a \"sensor\" to \n\"transmit a resulting signal\" or \"make available resulting information ,\" as Vector Flow advances. \nSee D.I. 152 at 16-17. Rather, Vector Flow relies on extrinsic evidence, including technical \ndictionaries and an expert declaration, to support its contention that sensors necessarily transmit \nsignals based on the information detected. Id. (citing three dictionary definitions of \"sensor,\" see \nD.I. 131-1, Ex. 16-18, and an Expert Declaration of Stephen Gray, see D.I. 131-1, Ex. 21). \nHowever, a Court should not rely on extrinsic evidence where reliance on a patent's intrinsic record \nresolves the ambiguity surrounding a term's meaning. See Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc., \n90 F.3d 1576, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \n8 Vector Flow also contends that HID limited the scope of\"sensor\" when it \"distinguish[ed] \nprior art on the basis that it did not disclose the claimed 'sensor devices' as required by the claims.\" \nD.I. 152 at 16. \"Under the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer , a patentee may limit the meaning \nof a claim term by making a clear and unmistakable disavowal of scope during prosecution. \" \nPurdue Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms. Inc., 438 F.3d 1123, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2006). However , courts \nwill not apply the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer unless the disclaimer is \"both clear and \nunmistakable to one of ordinary skill in the art.\" Elbex Video, Ltd. v. Sensormatic Elecs. Corp., \n508 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quotations omitted). Here, what minimal support Vector \nFlow points to does not demonstrate that HID had a clear and unmistakable intent to limit the scope \nof\"sensor\" to a device that detects only physical stimuli. See D.I. 131-1, Ex. 15 at 8. To be sure, \nin prosecuting the '704 patent, HID distinguished the prior art as failing to \"teach or suggest that \nthe system and method of integration disparate sensor devices, normalizing the sensor data and \nprocessing this normalized data through a comprehensive policy/rule system.\" Id. That is, \nnowhere in the cited prosecution history does HID even use the phrases \"physical stimuli\" or \n\"transmits a signal,\" let alone language that would indicate an express intent to limit the scope of \n\"sensor.\" Finding no evidence of a clear and unmistakable statement limiting \"sensor\" to \"a device \nthat responds to a physical stimulus and transmits a resulting signal,\" the Court declines to apply \nthe doctrine of prosecution disclaimer. See Elbex Video, Ltd., 508 F .3d at 13 71. \nFinding no evidence in the claims, specification , or prosecution history to support limiting \n\"sensor\" exclusively to responding to physical stimuli, the Court will apply the plain and ordinary \nmeaning, which is the default in claim construction. Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. Vector Flow urges \nthe Court to look to technical dictionaries defining \"sensor,\" e.g., \"a device that responds to a \nphysical stimulus and transmits a resulting impulse\"-to ensure the term's plain and ordinary \n9 meaning is consistent with how it is understood in the art. D .I. 152 at 16-17. While dictionary \ndefinitions can be useful in informing the Court about a technical term's generally understood \nmeaning in the art, see Starhome GmbH v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 743 F.3d 849, 856 (Fed. Cir. \n2014), where the dictionary definition contradicts the term's meaning as informed by the intrinsic \nrecord, the Court should not rely on the dictionary definition. See Ruckus Wireless, Inc. v. \nInnovative Wireless Sols., LLC, 824 F.3d 999, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2016). As the Court has already \nexplained, the intrinsic record does not support limiting \"sensor\" to exclusively responding to \nphysical stimuli or requiring that a \"sensor\" \"transmit a resulting signal\" or \"make available \nresulting information.\" Accordingly, the Court will not rely on extrinsic evidence that contradicts \nthe intrinsic record. Thus, the Court will construe \"sensor\" to have its plain and ordinary meaning \nas informed by the intrinsic record, which means \"a device configured to respond to a stimulus.\" \nB. \"sensor data\" \nThe claim term \"sensor data\" appears in claims 11 and 13 of the '704 patent. The parties' \ncompeting proposed constructions for \"sensor data\" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term HID's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"the data transmitted by a sensor in \nresponse to a physical stimulus\" \n\"sensor data\" Plain and ordinary meaning Alternatively: \"the data made \navailable by a sensor in response to \na physical stimulus\" \nLike the term \"sensor\" above, see supra Section III.A, the parties dispute whether \"sensor \ndata\" is limited to the data exclusively from a response to physical stimuli. D.I. 152 at 22-23. \nHowever, as explained by the Court, there is no evidence in the claims, specification, or \nprosecution history to support construing \"sensor\" or \"sensor data\" to only a device, or its \nassociated information, that exclusively detects or responds to physical stimuli. Importantly, and \n10 once again, the portion of the specification Vector Flow relies on for its proposed construction \nrelates to collecting data from physical sensors, as opposed to \"a sensor.\" D .I. 152 at 22 ( citing \n'704 patent at 11 :63-66 (\"The system collects data and alarm events from physical sensors, \nmonitors and/or alarms distributed throughout the monitored facilities.\")). \nAs such, because a term's plain and ordinary meaning is the default in claim construction , \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1316, the Court adopts the plain and ordinary meaning of \"sensor data.\" \nNotably, both HID and Vector Flow agree that \"sensor data\" must come from the sensor, see, e.g., \nD.I. 131-1, Ex. 21 at ,r,r 33-38; D.I. 131-1, Ex. 14 at 28:4-14, although HID contends that simply \ndefining \"sensor data\" as information \"associated with\" a sensor is sufficient. D.I. 152 at 14. \nHowever, as Vector Flow argues, information \"associated with\" a sensor can include its price, \ncolor, and other information that, in the context of the Asserted Patents, is clearly not contemplated \nto be \"sensor data.\" Id. at 22-23. But that premise belies any need to further construe \"sensor \ndata\" beyond the term's plain and ordinary meaning because, as Vector Flow concedes, \ninformation such as a sensor's price/cost or color \"would not be considered 'sensor data' in \ncontext\" of the Asserted Patents. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1313 (A person of ordinary skill in the \nart \"is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the \ndisputed term appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification \"). \nTherefore, the Court will construe \"sensor data\" to have its plain and ordinary meaning- \"the data \ngenerated by a sensor in response to a stimulus.\" \nC. \"native data representation format\" \nThe claim term \"native data representation format\" appears in claims 11 and 13 of the '704 \npatent. The parties' competing proposed constructions for \"native data representation format\" are \nset out in the chart below: \n11 Claim Term IIlD's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"the original format of the data \ntransmitted by a sensor in response \nto a physical stimulus\" \nAlternatively: \"the original format \n\"native data of the data made available by a \nrepresentation format\" Plain and ordinary meaning sensor in response to a physical \nstimulus\" \nOR \n\"a data format that is built into a \nsensor\" \nThe parties agree that \"native data representation format\" should be construed to have its \nplain and ordinary meaning. D.I. 152 at 23-24. However , the parties dispute whether the plain \nand ordinary meaning of \"native data representation format\" refers to the data format \"built into\" \nthe sensor, or merely the data format \"from\" a sensor. Id. at 23-27. While the parties agree that \nthe term's plain and ordinary meaning shall apply, a dispute still exists as to the proper scope of \n\"native data representation format\" which requires the Court to construe the term. See 02 Micro \nInt'! Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nThe Court begins its analysis with the language of the claim itself. The use of the disputed \nterm in claim 11 of the '704 patent is representati ve. \n11. A method comprising : \ninterfacing in a centralized security system, a plurality of security sensor types \ndistributed throughout a plurality of sites, each sensor type configured to \nrespond to a corresponding type of actionable event, each sensor type provided \nby a different manufacturer of a plurality of manufacturers; \naccepting sensor data from each security sensor an integration module \nincluding an agent for each type of security sensor, wherein the sensor data \nfrom each security sensor is embodied in a native data representation format \nof each respective manufacturer of the plurality of manufacturers ; \n12 defining individual user profiles and their respective access privileges and \ncredentials in the system; \nmapping the sensor data from each security sensor in the native data \nrepresentation format of each manufacturer of the plurality of manufacturers \nto a common data representation format, the common data representation \nformat including a data object and processing information for the sensor data; \nSee '704 patent at claim 11 ( emphases added). \nThe plain language of the claim makes clear that \"native data representation format\" is the \ndata format from a sensor. Claim 13 of the '704 patent further supports that \"native data \nrepresentation format\" is the data format from a sensor. See '704 patent at claim 13 (\"[C]onverting \nthe native data representation format for each security sensor into XML (Extensible Markup \nLanguage) format, and wherein the native data representation format encompasses native sensor \ndata ... \"). Contrary to Vector Flow's position, there is no intrinsic support for limiting \"native \ndata representation format\" to the data derived in response \"to a physical stimulus.\" D.I. 152 at \n23; see supra Section III.A. Further, while the parties dispute whether \"native data representation \nformat\" requires that the data format be the \"original format,\" or \"built into\" the sensor, there is \nno intrinsic support to further construe the disputed term beyond the clear meaning recited by the \nclaims. See 3M Innovative Props., 725 F.3d at 1333. Notably, Vector Flow's proposed \nconstruction relies almost entirely on extrinsic evidence, including technical dictionary definitions \nand expert testimony. See D.I. 152 at 24-25 (citing a declaration from Vector Flow's expert, \nStephen Gray, and a definition from the Microsoft Computer Dictionary). But Vector Flow has \nnot shown a need to resort to extrinsic evidence, particularly when the claim language and \nspecification of the '704 patent speaks to the construction. See Vitronics Corp., 90 F .3d at 1584 \n(Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"Only ifthere were still some genuine ambiguity in the claims, after consideration \nof all available intrinsic evidence, should the trial court have resorted to extrinsic evidence, such \n13 as expert testimony, in order to construe [a] claim.\"). In fact, the claim language resolves any \nconfusion as to whether \"native data representation format\" is the original data format from a \nsensor by explicitly reciting that \"the sensor data from each security sensor\" is embodied in the \ndata format \"of each respective manufacturer in the plurality of manufactures.\" See '704 patent at \nclaim 11. Nor is there intrinsic support to limit \"native data representation format\" to the sole or \nexclusive data format from a sensor, as Vector Flow contends, see Tr. at 46-47, because \nindependent claim 11 of the '704 patent uses the indefinite article \"a\" to suggest that the claimed \nmethod could include more than one data format. See '704 patent at claim 11; see also United \nTherapeutics Corp. v. Liquidia Techs., Inc., No. 20-755-RGA, 2022 WL 3910252, at *16 (D. Del. \nAug. 31, 2022) (\"The Federal Circuit 'has repeatedly emphasized that an indefinite article 'a' or \n'an' in patent parlance carries the meaning of 'one or more' in open-ended claims containing the \ntransitional phrase 'comprising.\"' (quoting KCJ Corp. v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 223 F.3d 1351, \n1356 (Fed. Cir. 2000))). \nAccordingly, the Court will adopt the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"native data \nrepresentation format,\" which means \"a data format from a sensor.\" \nD. \"individual user profiles\" \nThe claim term \"individual user profiles\" appears in claim 11 of the '704 patent. The \nparties' competing proposed constructions for \"individual user profiles\" are set out in the chart \nbelow: \nClaim Term IDD's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"individual user Plain and ordinary meaning \"a profile corresponding to an \nprofiles\" individual user\" \nThe parties dispute boils down to whether \"individual user profiles\" means a profile that \nuniquely corresponds to an individual user, or whether the disputed term could encompass a shared \n14 profile for a group of multiple users. D.I. 152 at 28, 30-31. While both parties agree that \"user \nprofile\" is a common term with a well-understood meaning, the Court must construe \"individual \nuser profiles\" because a dispute still exists as to the extent the word \"individual \" modifies the \ndisputed term. Id; see also 02 Micro, 521 F.3d at 1360. \nStarting with the claim language , claim 11 of the '704 patent recites: \n11. A method comprising: \ndefining individual user profiles and their respective access privileges and \ncredentials in the system; \nmapping the sensor data from each security sensor in the native data \nrepresentation format of each manufacturer of the plurality of manufacturers \nto a common data representation format, the common data representation \nformat including a data object and processing information for the sensor data; \ngenerating unique physical access privileges and credentials to exclusively \nmap a defined user profile to a spatial hierarchy of physical sites along with \nsecurity devices of the system, wherein the unique physical access credentials \nmaintain a common representation of the user's identity across the plurality of \nsites and to associate specific user identities with respective actionable events; \ndefining physical security policies of the site in the context of user profiles at \nall sites through actionable representations of physical, network and \ninformation technology resources of the site, wherein the security policies \ndefine standardized rule definitions through visual rules depicted by live \nobjects that contain attributes to define their spatial relationship to the \nactionable representations, and that are applied to the actionable events \nnormalized to the common data representation format to produce normalized \nevent data; and \nreceiving the normalized event data and applying relevant transformation and \nrouting rules comprising condition-action sequences in order to maintain user \nprofiles and physical security states across the plurality of sites and to resolve \nthe actionable events through the associated specific user identities. \nSee '704 patent at claim 11 ( emphasis added). \nTurning to the '704 patent's specification , it explains that: \n[The disclosed system] also includes processes to generate unique physical access \ncredentials to provide an exclusive mapping between an individual's profile Gob, \n15 department, location, and so on) and an organization's spatial hierarchy of its global \nphysical security system deployments ( doors, buildings, lockers, safes, and so 011). \nFor personnel control, the integrated physical security management process 118 is \nconfigured to generate unique physical access credentials based on individual \nprofiles to automatically assign credentials across multiple global physical security \nsystems to overcome certain limitations (e.g., memory constraints) of standard \naccess control systems. \nThe disclosed system also provides processes and systems to generate unique \nphysical access credentials for exclusive mapping between an individual's profile \n(job, department , location, etc) and an organizations spatial hierarchy of its global \nphysical security system deployments ( doors, buildings, etc), and generates unique \naccess credentials based on individual profiles and automatic assignment across \nmultiple physical security systems overcoming certain hardware/software \nlimitations of standard access control system/hardware. \nSee '704 patent at 5:5-17 (emphases added). \nHID contends that, contrary to Vector Flow's position, the specification's use of the word \n\"individual\" does not imply that the \"profile\" must be limited to a single user. D.I. 152 at 30. \nRather, the specification uses \"individual\" as both a possessive noun, i.e., \"an individual's profile,\" \nand as an adjective, i.e., referring to an \"individual\" or \"separate\" profile. Id. at 30. Thus, based \non the '704 patent's specification, together with an understanding that \"individual\" is used as an \nadjective in claim 11 of the '704 patent, HID asserts that a person of ordinary skill in the art would \nunderstand that the scope of \"individual user profiles\" does \"encompass a shared profile for a \ngroup of multiple users.\" Id. at 31. \nWhen viewed in its entirety, the claim language makes clear that \"individual user profiles\" \ndoes not \"encompass a shared profile for a group of multiple users.\" While HID is correct that \n\"individual\" is used as an adjective in claim 11 to indicate that user profiles are \"separate,\" the rest \nof the claim language clarifies that \"individual user profiles\" refers to separate profiles specific to \nindividual users. See '704 patent at claim 11 (\"generating unique physical access privileges and \ncredentials to exclusively map a defined user profile ... wherein the unique physical access \n16 credentials maintain a common representation of the user's identity across the plurality of sites \nand to associate specific user identities with respective actionable events\"); see also id. at claim \n11 (\"receiving the normalized event data and applying relevant transformation and routing rules . \n. . to resolve the actionable events through the associated specific user identities. \"). This is \nconsistent with the '704 patent's specification , which explains that the disclosed system \"includes \nprocesses to generate unique physical access credentials to provide an exclusive mapping between \nan individual's profile\" and the organization's global physical security system deployments . See \n'704 patent at 5 :5-10; see also id. at 5: 11-17 (\"[T]he integrated physical security management \nprocess 118 is configured to generate unique physical access credentials based on individual \nprofiles to automatically assign credentials across multiple global physical security systems.\"). In \nother words, the disclosed processes are configured to generate a unique physical access credential \nbased on an individual user's profile. This is consistent with how a person of ordinary skill in the \nart would interpret \"individual user profiles\" based on the specification 's repeated explanation that \nthe disclosed system generates unique physical access credentials for exclusive mapping between \nan individual's profile and an organization 's spatial hierarchy ofits global physical security system \ndeployments . See id. at 18:29-38 (emphases added). \nVector Flaw's proposed construction most naturally aligns with the claim language, the \nspecification , and how a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand \"individual user \nprofiles.\" See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316 (\"The construction that stays true to the claim language \nand most naturally aligns with the patent's description of the invention will be, in the end, the \ncorrect construction.\") (quoting Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa' Per Azioni, 158 F.3d 1243, \n1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). Accordingly , the Court will construe the term \"individual user profiles\" \nto mean \"a profile corresponding to an individual user.\" \n17 E. \"visual rules\" \nThe claim term \"visual rules\" appears in claim 11 of the '704 patent. The parties' \ncompeting proposed constructions for \"visual rules\" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term IDD's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"a rule that is visually defined and \n\"visual rules\" Plain and ordinary meaning depicted in a display area by placing \nicons and connectors in appropriate \nrelationships to one another\" \nThe parties dispute whether \"visual rules\" is a coined term without a customary meaning \nin the relevant field, which would entail that the term \"cannot be construed broader than the \ndisclosure in the specification.\" D.I. 152 at 32-34 (quoting Indacon, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc., 824 \nF.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). \nA patent claim term may be a \"coined term\" that lacks an ordinary and customary meaning \nin the field. See, e.g., Iridescent Networks, Inc. v. AT&T Mobility, LLC, 933 F.3d 1345, 1351-53 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019); Indacon, 824 F.3d at 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Irdeto Access, Inc. v. Echostar \nSatellite Corp., 383 F.3d 1295, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2004). In such a case, the question is \"whether the \nintrinsic evidence provides objective boundaries to the scope of the term.\" Iridescent Networks, \n106 F.3d at 1353. Coined claim terms \"cannot be construed broader than the disclosure in the \nspecification.\" Indacon, 824 F.3d at 1357; see, e.g., Iridescent Networks, 106 F.3d at 1349-53 \n(finding \"high quality of service connection \" to be a \"coined\" term and affirming construction \nlimiting the term to the minimum parameters disclosed in the specification); Irdeto, 383 F.3d at \n1300 (limiting the term \"group key\" to a subset of a subscriber base where the patentee informed \nthe examiner that the terms \"group\" and \"box\" lack an ordinary meaning) ; Goldenberg v. Cytogen, \nInc., 373 F.3d 1158, 1164 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (where parties agreed that the term \"marker substance \" \nhas no accepted meaning, \"we construe [the term] only as broadly as is provided by the patent \n18 itself''). However , \"[t]he absence of a commonl y accepted meaning ... does not justify a narrow \nconstruction where the meaning may be ascertained from the constituent words.\" Facebook, Inc. \nv. Blackberry Ltd., 2019 WL 6828359, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2019) (citing Altiris, Inc. v. \nSymantec Corp., 318 F.3d 1363, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (\"(S]imply because a phrase as a whole \nlacks a common meaning does not compel a court to abandon its quest for a common meaning and \ndisregard established meanings of the individual words.\")). \nVector Flow has not carried its burden of demonstrating that \"visual rules\" is a coined term \nthat lacks an ordinary and customary meaning in the field. Here, the disputed term comprises the \nconstituent words \"visual\" and \"rules.\" The parties have already stipulated to, and the Court has \nadopted, the plain and ordinary meaning of \"rules.\" See supra Section II. Further, the parties do \nnot meaningfully dispute that the word \"visual\" has a plain and ordinary meaning that would be \nclear to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingl y, the Court is not persuaded that a person \nof ordinary skill in the art would not be able to ascertain the meaning of \"visual rules\" based on \nthe meaning of the constituent words \"visual\" and \"rules.\" See Altiris, Inc., 318 F.3d at 1372. \nHowever, even if \"visual rules\" was a coined term that \"cannot be construed broader than the \ndisclosure in the specification ,\" Indacon, 824 F.3d at 1357, the '704 patent's intrinsic record \nprovides ample support consistent with the well-understood meaning of the constituent words \n\"visual\" and \"rules\" such that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the objective \nboundaries of the term \"visual rules.\" Iridescent Networks, 106 F.3d at 1353. Claim 11 of the \n'704 patent recites the scope of the term ''visual rules\" as being \"depicted by live objects that \ncontain attributes to define their spatial relationship to the actionable representations. \" See '704 \npatent at claim 11. This is consistent with the '704 patent's specification , which recites that \"visual \nrule objects contain attributes that define their spatial relationships to other building blocks that \n19 are used to represent normalized systems, data and processes. \" See id. at 11: 10-13. In other words, \nthe '704 patent's intrinsic record demonstrates that a person of ordinary skill in the art would \nunderstand \"visual rules\" to mean \"rules that are visually defined.\" See generally id. at 16:3-17:6. \nThere is also no support for limiting \"visual rules\" to those \"visually defined and depicted \nin a display area by placing icons and connectors in appropriate relationships to one another.\" See \nD.I. 152 at 31 ( citing Vector Flaw's proposed construction). The portions of the specification \nVector Flow relies on either do not use the term \"visual rules,\" or are descriptions of various \nembodiment of the disclosed invention. Id. at 32-33 (citing '704 patent at 17:3-6 (explaining \nFigure 7), Figure 7; id. at 2:53-55 (explaining Figure 7); id. at 16:43-45 (\"In one embodiment , the \nsystem rules are created visually through the use of a stencil of object shapes that represent physical \nsystems, data flow and processes. \") (emphasis added)). Accepting this limitation would \nimproperly limit the scope of the disputed term to a single embodiment , i.e., Figure 7, which cannot \nbe correct. See Supercell Oy v. GREE, Inc., 2021 WL 4452082, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 29, 2021) \n( cautioning courts to avoid construing a term \"on the basis of a single exemplary embodiment \"). \nMoreover, the '704 patent's description of Figure 7 makes clear that Figure 7 is an embodiment of \na visual policy editor that allows the system to create \"visual rules\" using icons and connectors in \nappropriate relationships to one another, not that a visual policy editor is a \"visual rule.\" See '704 \npatent at 16:65-17:6. \nAccordingly , because a term's plain and ordinary meamng is the default in claim \nconstruction, Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316, the Court adopts the plain and ordinary meaning of\"visual \nrules,\" which means \"rules that are visually defined.\" \n20 F. \"live objects\" \nThe claim term \"live objects\" appears in claim 11 of the '704 patent. The parties' \ncompeting proposed constructions for \"live objects\" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term IDD's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"stencil shapes that are used to \n\"live objects\" meaning \"stencil objects\" represent normalized systems, data \nand processes\" \nThe parties dispute whether the '704 patent's intrinsic record clearly defines the term \"live \nobjects.\" Absent evidence of lexicograph y or disavowal , the Court will not depart from the plain \nmeaning of the claim terms. Thorner, 669 F.3d at 1365. The standard for finding lexicography is \n\"exacting.\" GE Lighting Sols., LLC v. AgiLight, Inc., 750 F.3d 1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2014). A \npatentee may act as its own lexicographer and redefine claim terms in the specification but must \n\"clearly express an intent to redefine the term.\" Thorner, 669 F.3d at 1365 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nBoth parties agree that a person of ordinary skill in the art, reading the entirety of the '704 \npatent, would understand that the terms \"stencil shapes\" and \"live objects\" can be used \ninterchangeably.2 D.I. 152 at 35-36; see also D.I. 131-1, Ex. 3 at ,r 77; id., Ex. 21 at ,r 60. This \nmakes sense, considering the '704 patent's specification explains: \"The visual rule objects contain \nattributes that define their spatial relationship to other building blocks that are used to represent \nnormalized systems, data and processes. Such building blocks are also referred to as stencil shapes \nor live objects.\" See '704 patent at 11 : 10-14 ( emphasis added). Yet, under the guise of \n2 During the Markman hearing, HID notably attempted to walk back its concession that \"stencil \nshapes\" and \"live objects\" can be used interchangeably . See Tr. at 81-82. However , the Court \nwill hold HID to what it stated in its briefing. See D.I. 152 at 35 (\"As such, POSITAs understand \nthat the terms \"stencil shapes\" and \"live objects\" are used interchangeably. \") ( citing D.I. 131-1, \nEx. 3 at ,r 77). \n21 compromise, HID proposes that \"[i]f the Court believes that it would be helpful to the factfinder , \nthe term 'live objects' can be described as stencil object.\" D.I. 152 at 35. However, HID's \nproposal fails to include the one concession it made-that \"stencil shapes\" are \"live objects\"-and \ninstead attempts to advance its proposed construction , \"stencil objects.\" Notably, the '704 patent's \nspecification separately explains \"stencil objects.\" See, e.g., '704 patent at 2:59-61, 3:26-31, 3:37-\n43, 16:49-51, 17:17-19, 17:22-24, 17:55-18:4; see also id. at Figures 8-11. But nothing in those \npassages supports HID's contention that \"live objects\" are \"stencil objects.\" Renishaw PLC, 158 \nF.3d at 1248 (\"[T]he resulting claim interpretation must, in the end, accord with the words chosen \nby the patentee to stake out the boundary of the claimed property. \") (emphasis added). \nRather, when the specification does disclose \"live objects,\" there is a clear and express \nintention by the patentee to define the disputed term. See Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316 (\"[T]he \nspecification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from \nthe meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's lexicography governs.\"). \n\"Stencil shapes\" are \"building blocks ,\" which the specification defines as being \"used to represent \nnormalized systems, data and processes. \" See '704 patent at 11: 10-14. The Court cannot \ncontemplate how the patentees could more clearly express their intention to define the disputed \nterm. See Hill-Rom Servs., 755 F.3d at 1372 (holding that \"refers to\" generally signals an express \nintent to define a term). Nor does requiring that \"live objects\" \"represent normalized systems, data \nand process\" improperly import an embodiment into the scope of the claim, as HID contends. D.I. \n152 at 3 7. Though true that \"it is improper to read limitations from a preferred embodiment \ndescribed in the specification \" into the claims, where there is \"a clear indication in the intrinsic \nrecord that the patentee intended the claims to be so limited,\" the Court will construe the disputed \nterm consistent with that express limitation. Liebel-Flarsheim , 358 F.3d at 913. \n22 Therefore , because the specification expresses a clear intent to define the term \"live \nobjects,\" that definition governs the Court's construction . \"Live objects\" is construed to mean \n\"stencil shapes that are used to represent normalized systems, data and processes .\" \nG. \"spatial relationship\" \nThe claim term \"spatial relationship \" appears in claims 11 and 15 of the '704 patent. The \nparties' competing proposed constructions for \"spatial relationship \" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term IDD's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"relationship in space between two \n\"spatial relationship \" which includes non-physical items,\" which does not include non-\nand logical relationships physical and logical relationships \nThe parties agree that \"spatial relationship\" means \"a relationship in space between two \nitems.\" D.I. 152 at 38-39. However, the parties dispute whether \"spatial relationship \" also \nencompasses logical and non-physical relationship s. HID argues that \"the claims and specification \nuse the term 'spatial relationship ' to refer to relationships between non-physical entities, such as \nobjects,\" and because a person of ordinary skill understands that \"non-physical entities\" in space \nare logical relationships , the disputed term must include physical, non-physical , and logical \nrelationships. Id. Vector Flow disagrees, arguing that, by definition , a \"spatial relationship \" \ncannot encompass a non-spatial relationship such as a logical relationship. Id. Rather, the \nspecification supports that \"spatial relationships\" must be physical relationships because \nrelationships between \"objects,\" as described by claims 11 and 15 of the '704 patent, are \nnecessarily displayed on a computer screen. Id. at 39-40 ( citing '704 patent at 11: 10-13). \nThe Court begins its analysis with the language of the claims themselves. \"Spatial \nrelationships \" is recited in claims 11 and 15 of the '704 patent as follows: \n23 11. A method comprising: \ndefining physical security policies of the site in the context of user profiles at \nall sites through actionable representations of physical, network and \ninformation technology resources of the site, wherein the security policies \ndefine standardized rule definitions through visual rules depicted by live \nobjects that contain attributes to define their spatial relationship to the \nactionable representations , and that are applied to the actionable events \nnormalized to the common data representation format to produce normalized \nevent data; ... \n*** \n15. The method of claim 11 further comprising representing , through a visual \neditor, each normalized physical sensor as an object containing one or more \nattributes that define a spatial relationship to other objects through one or more \ndefined rules, the visual editor including a drag and drop graphical user interface \ncomponent that facilitates creation of rules through interconnection of rule objects \nand definition of rule properties. \nSee '704 patent at claim 11, 15 (emphases added). \nTurning to the specification , the disputed term is only recited once: \"The visual rule objects \ncontain attributes that define their spatial relationship to other building blocks that are used to \nrepresent normalized systems, data and processes .\" See id. at 11: 10-13 ( emphasis added). Based \non the intrinsic record, the Court cannot conclude that \"spatial relationship \" is limited to only \nrelationships between physical entities. The '704 patent consistently references objects that \ncontain one or more attributes that define a \"spatial relationship \" to another object or building \nblock. Both parties agree that objects and building blocks are all \"virtual\" in the sense that each \nare \"implemented or created by a computer system.\" See D.I. 152 at 49 (citing D.I. 131-1, Ex. 3 \nat 1 128; D.I. 131-1, Ex. 21 at 1 86). Accordingly , finding nothing in the intrinsic record to \notherwise limit \"spatial relationships \" to only relationships between physical entities, the Court \nconstrues \"spatial relationships \" to mean \"relationship in space between two items, which can \ninclude physical, non-physical , and logical relationships. \" See Wasica Fin. GmbH, 853 F.3d at \n1282. \n24 H. \"physical security\" \nThe claim term \"physical security\" appears in claim 11 of the '704 patent and claims 15 \nand 16 of the '088 patent. The parties' competing proposed constructions for \"physical security\" \nare set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term HID's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"physical security\" Plain and ordinary meaning \"security of a physical site\" \nThe parties generally agree that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"physical \nsecurity\" relates to physical, as opposed to non-physical , security. D.I. 152 at 41-42; see also D.I. \n131-1, Ex. 21 at ,r 63 (\"The concept of 'physical security' would be understood in contrast with \nnonphysical security measures.\"); D.I. 131-1, Ex. 14 at 62: 17-63:8 (\"[I]n that context,\" the claims \nare \"talking about things related to physical security as opposed to, for example, IT data.\"). Thus, \nthe essence of the parties' dispute boils down to whether adopting Vector Flow' s construction \nwould improperly import a limitation into the scope of the disputed term. D.I. 152 at 42-43. \nAt the outset, the Court rejects Vector Flow's invitation to construe \"physical security\" to \n' include a \"site\" limitation. D.I. 152 at 42-43. As used throughout the '704 and '088 patents, \n\"physical security\" refers to a type or format of security, not the location or \"site\" of security. See, \ne.g., '704 patent at 1 :31-53 (referring to \"physical security systems\"); id. at 10:24-32 (referring to \n\"physical security policies\"); '088 patent at 10:54-56 (referring to \"physical security state \nengine\"); id. at 10:57-60 (referring to \"physical security states\"). Moreover, the term \"site\" is \nalready used as a separate limitation in the relevant claims of the '704 and '088 patents. See \nPromos Techs., Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 809 F. App'x 825, 834 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\"[I]t is \ngenerally improper to construe a patent claim so that express claim limitations or elements are \nrendered superfluous.\"). Claim 11 of the '704 patent expressly claims \"defining physical security \n25 policies of the site,\" and \"physical security states across the plurality of sites ... \" See '704 patent \nat claim 11. Claim 15 of the '088 patent similarly claims \"integrating the physical security data \nwith the information technology (IT) data of an entity within the managed site,\" but later uses the \ndisputed term to refer to \"physical security states through the rule to perform an action in \naccordance with the rule ... \" See '088 patent at claim 15. Clearly, the patentees knew how to \nclaim \"site\" when they desired, and did not do so for every recital of the term \"physical security.\" \nSee Takeda Pharm. Co. v. Zydus Pharms. USA, Inc., 743 F.3d 1359, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2014) \n( declining to limit claim when the inventors knew how to include those limitations \"when they so \ndesired\"); see also CFL Techs. LLCv. Osram Sylvania, Inc., No. 18-1445-RGA , 2022 WL 606329, \nat *9 (D. Del. Jan. 21, 2022). \nHaving rejected Vector Flow's efforts to limit \"physical security\" to that of a \"site,\" the \nCourt finds that the parties do not meaningfull y dispute the scope of the term \"physical security.\" \nSee US. Surgical Corp. v. Ethicon, Inc., 103 F.3d 1554, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (claim construction \n\"is not an obligatory exercise in redundanc y.\"). Both parties agree that \"physical security\" is \ndisclosed in the specifications of the '704 and '088 patents as including: \n[E]quipment and processes that implement physical security measures for \nincidents, access control, monitoring systems, lighting, security, audits, inspection , \nfacility management , building automation , and the like. Almost all businesses , large \ncommercial and government facilities, and many homes utilize physical security \nsystems to alert owners and operators about potentially harmful activities such as \nintrusion, theft, fire, flooding, gas leaks, and so on. \nSee, e.g., '704 patent at 1 :31-39; '088 patent at 1 :30-38; see D.I. 152 at 40-41. \nMoreover , neither party disputes that the term \"physical security\" as used in the \nspecifications of the '704 and '088 patents is consistent with the claim language. Thus, there is no \ngenuine dispute as to proper scope of the claim term that would require the Court to further \nconstrue the term. See Active Video Networks, Inc., 694 F.3d at 1325-26 (finding that the district \n26 court did not err in concluding that a term's plain and ordinary meaning applies without offering \nadditional construction); see also 02 Micro, 521 F.3d at 1360. As such, the Court adopts the plain \nand ordinary meaning of the term \"physical security,\" which is physical, as opposed to non\u00ad\nphysical security, and is not limited to any site. \nI. \"single integration layer component\" \nThe claim term \"single integration layer component\" appears in claim 15 of the '088 patent. \nThe parties' competing proposed constructions for \"single integration layer component\" are set \nout in the chart below: \nClaim Term HID's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \n\"single integration Plain and ordinary meaning Indefinite layer component\" \nThe crux of the parties' dispute is whether the term \"single integration layer component \" \nis indefinite or, whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand , with reasonable \ncertainty, its meaning based on the '088 patent's intrinsic record. Vector Flow contends that \n\"single integration layer component \" is indefinite \"because it is unclear (1) whether 'single' \ndescribes 'integration layer' or 'component,' (2) what is the scope of a single 'integration layer' \nor single 'component' (as opposed to non-single ) and (3) what constitutes an integration layer or \ncomponent (as opposed to what is not an integration layer or component).\" D.I. 152 at 45. HID \ndisagrees, arguing that, based on the intrinsic record, the term is readily understood with \nreasonably certainty to mean \"a system component that receives and integrates disparate \nproprietary data formats from respective security components.\" Id. at 44 (citing D.I. 131-1, Ex. 3 \nat 1105). \nSection 112 of the Patent Act requires that the claims of a patent \"particularly point[] out \nand distinctly claim[] the subject matter which the inventor ... regards as the invention. \" 35 \n27 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(b). The \"primary purpose of the definiteness requirement \" contained in\u00a7 112(b) \"is \nto ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent \nof the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, e.g., \ncompetitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe.\" All Dental Prodx, \nLLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \n\"A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification \ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those \nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention. \" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc., 572 \nU.S. 898,901 (2014). To determine indefiniteness , courts examine \"the patent record-the claims, \nspecification , and prosecution history-to ascertain if they convey to one of skill in the art with \nreasonable certainty the scope of the invention claimed.\" Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). While a '\"potential infringer\"' need not \"be able to \ndetermine ex ante if a particular act infringes the claims,\" the patentee must \"apprise the public 'of \nwhat is still open to them\u25a1\"' such that \"a person of ordinary skill in the art could determine whether \nor not an accused product or method infringes the claim.\" Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude Med. \nSC, Inc., 30 F.4th 1339, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (citations omitted) (internal quotations \nomitted). The challenger must \"prov[e] indefiniteness by clear and convincing evidence.\" BASF \nCorp. v. Johnson Matthey Inc., 875 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \nLike claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, but the Court must sometimes \nrender factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the issue of definiteness. See Sonix \nTech. Co. v. Publications Int'/, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1376 (F~d. Cir. 2017). \"[A]ny fact critical to \na holding on indefiniteness must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing evidence. \" \nOne-E-Way , Inc. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 859 F.3d 1059, 1062 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). \n28 Vector Flow has not carried its burden of demonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence, \nthat the disputed term \"single integration layer component \" is indefinite. First, contrary to Vector \nFlow' s contention , the claim language is not \"materially ambiguous\" as to whether \"single\" \nmodifies the term \"component \" or the term \"integration layer.\" D.I. 152 at 45. Rather, the plain \nlanguage of claim 15 of the '088 patent makes clear that \"single\" modifies the whole term \n\"integration layer component. \" See '088 patent at claim 15 (\"[R]eceiving , in a single integration \nlayer component from each of the plurality of objects in the proprietary data format of a respective \nsecurity component ... \"); see also Intel Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 21 F.4th 784, 792 (Fed. Cir. \n2021) (citing Hockerson-Halberstadt , Inc. v. Converse Inc., 183 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) \n(\"Proper claim construction ... demands interpretation of the entire claim in context, not a single \nelement in isolation.\")). \nSecond, there is no merit to Vector Plow's argument that \"(t]he specification fails to \ndifferentiate 'single' versus 'non-single \"' integration layers or components , because \"single\" is a \nplain-English term with a well-understood meaning. See D.I. 152 at 45; Brown v. 3M, 265 F.3d \n1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\"[Terms that] are not technical terms of art ... do not require elaborate \ninterpretation.\"). A person of ordinary skill in the art would readily understand , based on the claim \nlanguage, that the process receives one integration layer component from each of the plurality of \nobjects in the proprietary data format of a respective security component , as opposed to multiple, \ni.e., \"non-single ,\" integration layer components . That the '088 patent's specification broadly \ndefines \"component\" to mean a \"computer program, routine or subroutine that is executed on any \nof the server and/or client computers ... and may be implemented as software, firmware , or \nprogrammed hardware, \" does not render \"single integration layer component \" indefinite. See D.I. \n152 at 45; see '088 patent at 6:46-50. Rather, the plain language of dependent claim 15 expressly \n29 provides objective boundaries as to what constitutes a \"single integration layer component \" \nwithout limiting the form that the \"component \" could take. See Home Diagnostics , 381 F.3d at \n1358 (\"Absent a clear disavowal in the specification or the prosecution history, the patentee is \nentitled to the full scope of its claim language. \"). \nNor does the '088 patent fail to \"clarify[y] the boundaries of what might be a 'single' \n'component ' that receives data from a 'plurality' of sources as claim 15 requires.\" See D.I. 152 at \n48. As explained above, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that \"single\" \nmodifies the entire phrase \"integration layer component ,\" such that claim 15 requires one \nintegration layer component. Nor does the fact that \"integration layer\" is defined by the '088 \npatent to contain \"agents and adapters\" (plural) render \"single integration layer component \" \nindefinite. The '088 patent's specification explains that: \nAn integration layer contains agents and adapters with built-in intelligence for \nmultiple physical security systems and supports extensibility through mapping of \napplication protocols , command and data 152 formats for integration with new and \nemerging physical security systems. It also normalizes the communication data, \ncommands and events from the disparate physical security systems to a common \nstandard format. \nSee '088 patent at 7:59-66. \nThat an \"integration layer\" receives data from a plurality of sources is entirely consistent with the \nclaim language, which requires that the process receive in a single integration layer component \n\"from each of the plurality of objects in the proprietary data format of a respective security \ncomponent and integrate disparate proprietary data formats for aggregation and processing in \nother components ... \" See '088 patent at claim 15 (emphases added). \nAccordingly , Vector Flow has not carried its burden of demonstrating, by clear and \nconvincing evidence, that the term is indefinite. In other words, when read in light of the entirety \nof the '088 patent, a person of ordinary skill in the art would be clearly informed, with reasonable \n30 certainty, that the term \"single integration layer component \" has a definite meaning and scope. \nThus, the Court, based on the intrinsic record, construes \"single integration layer component \" to \nmean \"a system component that receives and integrates disparate proprietary data formats from \nrespective security components for aggregation and processing in other components. \" See, e.g., \n'088 patent at 7:59-66, 30:31-35. \nJ. \"virtual objects\" \nThe claim term \"virtual objects\" appears in claims 15 and 16 of the '088 patent. The \nparties' competing proposed constructions for \"virtual objects\" are set out in the chart below: \nClaim Term HID's Construction Vector Flow's Construction \nIndefinite . \n\"virtual objects\" Plain and ordinary meaning Alternatively: \"a visual depiction of \nan object that is not real\" \nThe crux of the parties' dispute is whether the term \"virtual objects\" is indefinite or, \nwhether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand, with reasonable certainty, its \nmeaning based on the '088 patent's intrinsic record. Vector Flow contends that \"virtual objects\" \nis indefinite because \"the ordinary meaning of the term 'object' in this context already entails that \nan object is virtual,\" and the intrinsic record fails to provide reasonable certainty to a person of \nordinary skill in the art as to the distinction between \"objects\" and \"virtual objects.\" D.I. 152 at \n49-50. Alternatively, Vector Flow argues that \"virtual objects\" should be construed as \"a visual \ndepiction of an object that is not real\" based on the purported plain and ordinary meanings of the \nterms \"virtual\" and \"objects.\" Id. HID disagrees , arguing that, \"[a]s reflected by the claims , virtual \nobjects describe system policies, 'comprise components of executable rules,' and have \nrelationships to the 'corresponding devices, objects and processes.\" Id. at 48. In other words, \n31 when read in light of the intrinsic evidence, the \"virtual objects\" clearly informs, with reasonable \ncertainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention. Id. at 50-51. \nApplying the same framework as detailed above, see supra Section III.I, the Court finds \nthat Vector Flow has not met its burden of demonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence, that \n\"virtual objects\" is indefinite. See BASF Corp., 875 F.3d at 1365. While the disputed term is \nnever used in the '088 patent's specification , the meaning of \"virtual objects\" is reasonabl y \ndiscernible to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the claim language. As claim 15 of the \n'088 patent discloses: (1) \"the XML format is configured to describe system policies through the \nuse of virtual objects,\" (2) virtual objects \"comprise components of executable rules,\" and (3) there \nare \"relationships between the virtual objects and corresponding devices, objects and processes .\" \nSee '088 patent at claim 15. Thus, a person of ordinary skill would readily understand that \"virtual \nobjects\" are components of executable rules used to describe system policies which have \nrelationships with corresponding devices, objects, and processes. \nThis understanding is consistent with the '088 patent's specification , which discloses \nmultiple types of objects. Both parties agree that these disclosed objects are all \"virtual\" in the \nsense that each are \"implemented or created by a computer system.\" See D.I. 152 at 49 ( citing D.I. \n131-1, Ex. 3 at ,r 128; D.I. 131-1, Ex. 21 at ,r 86). Thus, based on the intrinsic evidence, a person \nof ordinary skill in the art would understand , with reasonable certainty, that the various types of \nobjects disclosed by the '088 patent are all a type of \"virtual object.\" \nAccordingly , because a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand , with \nreasonable certainty, the meaning of the disputed term \"virtual objects\" based on the '088 patent's \nintrinsic record, \"virtual objects\" is not indefinite. As Vector Flow has not carried its burden of \ndemonstrating , by clear and convincing evidence, that the term is indefinite , the Court construes \n32 the disputed term to have its plain and ordinary meaning as informed by the intrinsic record. See \nPhillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. In construing \"virtual objects,\" the Court rejects Vector Plow's \nalternative construction , \"a visual depiction of an object that is not real,\" for two reasons. See D.I. \n152 at 48, 51. First, there is no support in the intrinsic record to limit \"virtual objects\" to graphic \ndepictions of objects that are \"not real.\" In fact, the '088 patent's specification discloses multiple \nexamples of graphical representations of objects that are real, see '088 patent at 21:11-16 \n( disclosing \"a graphic of a building for a site\" and \"a graphic of a person for an actor or personnel \nwithin the system\"), which a person of ordinary skill would understand are types of \"virtual \nobjects.\" See WL. Gore & Assocs. v. Medtronic, Inc., 834 F. Supp. 2d 465, 482 (E.D. Va. 2011) \n(\"It is generally improper for this Court to construe claims in such a way as to exclude examples \ndisclosed in the specification. \") (citing Oatey Co. v. JPS Corp., 514 F.3d 1271, 1276-77 (Fed. Cir. \n2008)). Second, limiting \"virtual objects\" to \"graphic depictions \" would render dependent claim \n16-which separately recites that \"a graphical visual policy editor that processes virtual objects, \nand wherein the physical security states and their relationships with network resources are \nmanaged and depicted as the virtual objects\"-superfluous . Promos Techs., 809 F. App'x at 834. \nAccordingly , finding nothing in the intrinsic record to support Vector Flow' s proposed \nconstruction , nor evidence compelling a different interpretation, the Court construes \"virtual \nobjects\" to have its plain and ordinary meaning, which means \"components of executable rules \nused to describe system policies which have relationships with corresponding devices, objects, and \nprocesses.\" \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court will construe the disputed claim terms as described above. The Court will issue \nan Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n33 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nHID GLOBAL CORPORATION , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nVECTOR FLOW, INC. et al., \nDefendants . \nORDER C.A.
