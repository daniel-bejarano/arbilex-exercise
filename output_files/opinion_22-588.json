No. 22-588- RGA- JLH \n      \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nDefendants Russell Odegard and Michael Pruett (\u201cDefendants\u201d) move to dismiss Count II \nof Plaintiff Infinity Laboratory Group Inc.\u2019 s (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s) Complaint for failure to state a claim.  \n(D.I. 8.)  Judge Andrews referred the motion to me on July 15, 2022.  (D.I. 13.)  The motion is \nfully briefed (D.I. 9, 11, 12, 16), and I heard oral argument  on November 29, 2022.  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing, I recommend that  the motion  be \nDEN IED. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201c To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018 state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201c factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged. \u201d  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  In determining the sufficiency of the complaint \nunder the plausibility standard, all \u201c well-pleaded facts \u201d are assumed to be true, but legal 2 \n conclusions are not.  Id. at 679.  The inquiry is not \u201c whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail\u201d  but \ninstead only \u201c whether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence to support his or her claims.\u201d   Grier \nv. Klem , 591 F.3d 672, 676 (3d Cir. 2010).  \nFraud claims  must also satisfy Fed eral Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)\u2019 s heightened pleading \nstandard.  That rule requires a complaint alleging fra ud to \u201c state with particularity the \ncircumstances constituting fraud or mistake. \u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  \u201c This has been interpreted to \nrequire that plaintiffs state the circumstances of the alleged fraud with sufficient particularity to \nplace the defendan t on notice of the precise misconduct with which it is charged and plead or allege \nthe date, time and place of the alleged fraud or otherwise inject precision or some measure of substantiation into a fraud allegation.\u201d   Alpizar \u2013Fallas v. Favero, 908 F.3d 910, 919 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(cleaned up) (quoting Frederico v. Home Depot , 507 F.3d 188, 200 (3d Cir. 2007)).  However, \nknowledge and intent \u201c may be alleged generally. \u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).   \nII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court \u2019s report and recommendation was announced from the bench on November 29, \n2022, as follows:  \nI\u2019m ready to give you my r eport and recommendation on the \npending partial motion to dismiss .  I will summarize the reasons for \nmy recommendation  in a moment.   But before I do, I want to be \nclear that my failure to address a particular argument or case cited  \nby a party does not mean that I did not consider it.  We have carefully \nconsidered everything.  I am not going to read my understanding of \nthe applicable law into the record today; however, we will incorporate a transcript of my report and recommendation into a \nseparate, written document, and we will include a summary of the applicable law in that document.  \n This dispute arises out of the sale of Dynalabs, LLC \n(\u201cDynalabs \u201d or the \u201c Company\u201d ) to Plaintiff Infinity Lab Group Inc. \nas set forth in a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ( \u201cMIPA \u201d) \ndated July 17, 2020.  The Complaint names as defendants Russell Odegard and Michael Pruett, who were co -CEOs of Dynalabs and 3 \n were its majority owners befor e the sale.  The MIPA designated \nDefendants as the \u201cSeller Representatives. \u201d  (D.I. 1 \u00b6 \u00b6 1, 2, 7, Ex. 1  \n\u00a7 8.1.)  \n \nPlaintiff \u2019s Complaint has two counts.  Count I alleges breach \nof contract.  Count II alleges fraud.  Defendants want the Court to dismiss the fraud count.  For purposes of ruling on this motion to \ndismiss, the Court may consider the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, and documents integral to or explicitly relied on in the complaint.\n0F1  The Court must accept well -pleaded factual \nallegations as true and view those facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.   \n \nDynalabs is \u201cin the business of performing microbiological \nanalysis and chemical and physical testing in the pharmaceutical sector and performing on- site drug identification and potency testing \nthrough the use of its proprietary \u2018 DVx \u2019 technology.\u201d   (D.I. 1 \u00b6  11.)  \nPursuant to the MIPA, [Plaintiff]  agreed to purchase the \nmembership interests in the Company for $10 million subject to various adjustments.  ( Id. \u00b6 11.)  The parties understood that the \npurchase price was calculated based upon a 10x multiple of the Company\u2019 s adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, \nand Amortization ( \u201cEBITDA \u201d).  (Id. ) \n Plaintiff alleges that it decided to engage in the transa ction \nin reliance upon several express representations and warranties in the MIPA.  ( Id.)  Article 4 of the MIPA contains the representations \nand warranties of the Company.  In Section 4.4(a), the Company represented and warranted that \u201c [t]he Financial Statements are \ncomplete and correct in all material respects and have been . . . prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position, results of the operations and cash flows of the Company at their respective dates  \n. . . .\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 12, Ex. 1 \u00a7 4.4(a).)   In Section 4.4(d), the Company \nrepresented that \u201c [a]ll accounts receivable of the Business . . . are \nproperly reflected in the books and records of the Company and on the Balan ce Sheet in accordance with the Accounting Principles, \nconsistently applied . . . .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 13, Ex. 1 \u00a7 4.4(d).)   Exhibit B of \nthe MIPA sets forth the \u201c Accounting Principles.\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 14, Ex. 1 at \nEx. B.)  The Accounting Principles generally state that the company recognizes revenue over time as services are provided in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to for the services.  The Accounting Principles state that the Company adopted Financial Account Standards Board (\u201cFASB \u201d) Accounting \n \n1  In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). 4 \n Standards Update ( \u201cASU \u201d) No. 2014\u201309, \u201cRevenue from Contracts \nwith Customers (Topic 606),\u201d  which requires companies to establish \nand maintain an unearned revenue reserve to account for such \npayments, and allows companies to gradually book revenue over time and decrease the unearned revenue account accordingly as services are provided to customers.  The Accounting Principles further assert that the Company analyzed Topic 606 and concluded that no changes were necessary to conform with Topic 606\u2019 s \nstandard.  ( Id.) \n The MIPA also contains detailed indemnification \nprovisions.  Section 7.2 generally provides (in pertinent part) that the Sellers shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Buyer \nagainst and in respect of any losses arising or resulting from (i) the breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of the Company, and (ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Com pany.  ( Id. \u00b6 16, Ex. 1 \u00a7 7.2(a)(i),(ii).)  \nSections 7.1 and 7.6 provide that, notwithstanding other limitations and restrictions in the MIPA, nothing in the agreement limits or restricts the Buyer \u2019s remedies with respect to fraud claims.  ( Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 15, 18, Ex. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 7.1, 7.6(a) .) \n Following the closing, Plaintiff discovered that the \nCompany\u2019 s revenue recognition and unearned revenue reserve \naccounting practices were not in accordance with Topic 606, belying \nits contrary representations in the MIPA.  ( Id. \u00b6 19.)  According to \nthe Complaint, the FDA audited the Company in September 2019 and found that a number of its testing methods were unacceptable.  (Id. \u00b6 20.)  As a result, the Company experienced a surge in demand \nfor revalidation testing for many of it s customers.  ( Id.)  The \nCompany invoiced the customers for whom it had quoted pricing for revalidation testing.  ( Id.)  However, as of March 31, 2020, due to a \nlack of capacity resulting from the unexpected demand, the Company had not begun the revalidati on testing in any material \nrespect.  ( Id.) \n Because the Company received payment for revalidation \ntesting services that it had not yet begun, Topic 606 required it to account for the payments in an unearned revenue account, instead of booking the entire am ount to revenue upon receipt of payment.  \n(Id. \u00b6 21.)  The Company, however, recognized revenue \nimmediately upon invoicing customers for revalidation testing, which had the effect of improperly inflating the Company\u2019 s \nEBITDA.  ( Id. \u00b6 22.)  Dynalabs \u2019 then -CFO Steve Crouse knew that \nthe Company was failing to properly account for unearned revenue, thereby boosting current revenue, as evidenced by the fact that the 5 \n Company properly applied Topic 606 to other aspects of the \nCompany\u2019 s business.  ( Id. \u00b6 22.) \n Because the Company booked revalidation service payments \nimmediately as revenue instead of accounting for the payments in its unearned revenue reserve, its revenue and thus its EBITDA were artificially inflated by $419,368 as of March 30, 2020.  ( Id. \u00b6 23.)  \nPlaintiff alleges that \u201c the Company and Defendants were . . . aware \nthat [Plaintiff \u2019s] valuation of Dynalabs and the Purchase P rice were \nbased upon a 10x multiple applied to Dynalabs \u2019 adjusted EBITDA \u201d \nand that Plaintiff relied on the MIPA \u2019s representations  and \nwarranties regarding the Company\u2019 s accounting practices when it \nagreed to purchase the Company for $10 million.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 24.)  \n On May 5, 2022, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against \nDefendants \u201cin their capacity as \u2018 Seller Representatives \u2019\u201d under the \nMIPA.  (D.I. 1  at 1.)  As mentioned, Defendants seek dismissal of \nthe fraud count.   \n Under Delaware Law,\n1F2 the elements of fraud are (1) a  false \nrepresentation, usually one of fact , (2) the defendant \u2019s knowledge or \nbelief that the representation was false, or made with reckless indifference to the truth , (3) an intent to induce the plaintiff to act or \nrefrain from acting , (4) the plaint iff\u2019s action or inaction taken in \njustifiable reliance upon the representation, and (5) d amage to the \nplaintiff as a result of such reliance.\n2F3  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 9(b) requires a plaintiff alleging fraud to state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.  \n I agree with Plaintiff that the Complaint adequately alleges \nfraud in connection with the Company\u2019 s warranties and \nrepresentations in the MIPA.  In particular, Plaintiff alleges that the Company, acting through its representat ives Defendants Odegard \nand Pruett, falsely represented in Sections 4.4(a) and (d) of the MIPA that the company \u2019s financial statements were correct in all \nmaterial respects and were prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles, including Topic 606.  Plaintiff alleges that it relied on those allegedly false representations in the MIPA when it agreed to the deal and that it was damaged because it purchased the Company at an inflated price.  \n \n2 MIPA Section 9.8 provides that \u201c[ t]he validity, interpretation and effect of the [MIPA]  \nshall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to be carried out wholly within such State.\u201d  (D.I. 1, Ex. 1 \u00a7 9.8.)  \n \n3 Gaffin v. Teledyne, Inc. , 611 A.2d 467, 472 (Del. 1992).  6 \n  \nIndeed, Defendants \u2019 reply brief does not dispute that the \nComplaint adequately sets for the who, what, when, where, and how \nof an alleged fraud in connection with the identified representations in the MIPA.  Instead, Defendants contend that the Complaint does \nnot adequately plead that the Company had knowledge that  the \nMIPA representations and warranties were false and the Company intended to induce Plaintiff to act.   \n I disagree.  For starters, I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s too much of an \nexaggeration to say that the whole point of a representations and warranties section in a contract is to induce the other party to the \ncontract to enter into the contract.\n3F4   \n And as for the Company\u2019 s knowledge that the MIPA \nstatements were false, Rule 9(b) permits \u201c knowledge \u201d to be \u201calleged \ngenerally .\u201d\n4F5  Thus, to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint \nonly needs to allege that the entity accused of fraud knew the statement was false and the complaint needs to include enough factual allegations to make such knowledge  plausible.  \n Plaintiff \u2019s Complaint complies with Rule 9(b).  The \nComplaint alleges that the FDA invalidated the Company \u2019s testing \nmethods, resulting in a surge of revalidation testing, and that the Company\u2019 s CFO knew that it had failed to adequately reserve the \nunearned revenue account for that testing, as evidence d by the fact \nthat the Company accurately maintained the unearned revenue accounts for services other than revalidation testing.  The Complaint further alleges that the Defendants were \u201c key executives at the \nCompany\u201d  and  were \u201c well aware\u201d  of the fact that the Company was \nbooking revenue immediately instead of gradually over time.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6 2.)  It \u2019s not implausible to think that high- level Company \nexecutives would know about an adverse FDA action and the resulting surge in demand for revalidation testing, and that they \nwould discuss the resulting impact on the Company\u2019 s financials \nwith other high- level executives including the CFO \u2014especially \nsince the facts alleged in the Complaint suggest that the revalidation \n \n4 See Prairie Cap ital III, L.P. v. Double E Holding Corp., 132 A.3d 35, 62 (Del. Ch. 2015) \n(\u201cWhen a party sues based on [] written representation [s] in a contract , . . . [i]t is reasonably \ninferable that the defendants intended to induce reliance on the representations  because they \nappeared in a written agreement.\u201d).   \n \n5 Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see also Mech. Contractors Ass\u2019n of Am., Inc. v. Hilton Franchise \nHolding, LLC , No. 20- 759-SB, 2020 WL 7481771 , at *1 (D. Del. Dec. 18, 2020) (\u201c[Plaintiff] must \nplead this fraud claim \u2018with particularity,\u2019 though it can allege knowledge and intent \u2018generally.\u2019\u201d ).  7 \n invoicing made up a huge chunk of the Company \u2019s revenue during \na relevant time period.   \n \nThe Complaint also alleges that Defendants knew that the \nCompany\u2019 s purchase price would be calculated based in part on its \nrevenue and that Defendants were the majority owners and thus stood to gain from the sale.  ( See, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 11, 24, Ex. 1.)  Those \nfactual allegations, considered in combination with Defendants \u2019 \nclear interest in obtaining the highest possible price for the Company, make it plausible that the CFO, Defendants, and the Company knew that the Company was inappropriately accounting for its revenue in contradiction to the representations and warranties \nmade by the Company in the MIPA.   \n In their r eply brief, Defendants contend that Plaintiff \u2019s \nDelaware common law fraud claim must comply with the \u201cstrong \ninference\u201d  standard [for pleading scienter] applicable to securities \nlitigation under the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n5F6  \nDefendants are incorrect.  Even if the argument were not waived, I reject it.  Defendants have cited no case in which the Third Circuit (or even any court in this district) has applied the PSLRA pleading requir ements to a state law common law fraud claim.  The PSLRA, \nby its terms, applies to federal securities fraud suits.\n6F7    \n Defendants also suggest in their briefs, and suggested during \nthe hearing today, that the Company could not have committed fraud \nbecaus e its application of Topic 606 was reasonable.  I understand \nthat argument.  However, we are at the motion to dismiss stage, and \non this record the Court is not prepared say as a matter of law that what the Company was doing was reasonable.  Defendants \u2019 counsel \nsuggested today that they will have an expert to support the Company\u2019 s accounting treatment , and Defendants are, of course,  \nfree to defend the Company\u2019 s accounting at the summary judgment \nstage.   \n \nAs Defendants do not make any other arguments supporting \ndismissal of the fraud claim, I recommend that the Court deny \nDefendants \u2019 motion to dismiss that claim.   \n \n \n6 See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u\u20134(b)(2); Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. \n308, 320\u201321 ( 2007) .  \n \n7 See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(a) (\u201c The provisions of this subsection shall apply in each private \naction arising under this chapter  [2B of Title 15]  that is brought as a plaintiff class action pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .\u201d).   8 III. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Defendants \u2019 partial motion to dismiss  \n(D.I. 8) be  DENIED . \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limited to \nten p ages.   Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten \npages.   The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de \nnovo review in the district court.    \nThe parties are directed to t he Court \u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed.
