INTRODUCTION\n\nPending before the Court is an Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) filed by Petitioner Donta E. Vickers (\u201cPetitioner\u201d). (D.I. 1) The State\nfiled an Answer in opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 7; D.I. 11) For the reasons\ndiscussed, the Court will dismiss the Petition as time-barred under the limitations period prescribed\nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nOn June 10, 2014, after \u201cgrand jury indictments and a mistrial granted to allow [Petitioner]\nto explore potentially exculpatory evidence that came to light during a first trial,\u201d a Delaware\nSuperior Court jury found Petitioner guilty of second degree assault (as a lesser included offense of\nfirst degree assault), attempted first degree robbery, home invasion, second degree conspiracy, and\nthree counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d). Vickers \u00bb.\nState, 117 A.3d 516, 518 (Del. June 11, 2015). Petitioner\u2019s convictions stemmed from a home\ninvasion during which Petitioner shot the victim in the leg. See State v. Vickers, 2017 WL 2265104, at\n*1 (Del. Super. Ct. May 18, 2017). On August 8, 2014, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as a\nhabitual offender to life imprisonment for his attempted first degree robbery, home invasion, and\nPFDCF convictions, ten years of incarceration for his second degree assault conviction, and two\nyears of incarceration for his second degree conspiracy conviction. See Vickers, 117 A.3d at 518. On\nAugust 20, 2014, the Superior Court filed a corrected sentencing order, to reflect that there would\nnot be an entry of a civil judgment, but left all other terms intact. (D.I. 7 at 3) Petitioner appealed,\nand the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed his convictions on June 11, 2015. See Vickers, 117 A.3d\n\nat 521.\nOn October 13, 2015, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a pro se motion for\npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d).\n(D.L. 8-1 at 9, Entry No. 102) The Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner, who\nfiled an amended Rule 61 motion on Petitioner\u2019s behalf on December 14, 2016. (D.I. 8-1 at 10,\nEntty No. 116) The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on May 19, 2017. See Vickers, 2017\nWL 2265104, at *4. Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that judgment\non January 24, 2018. See Vickers v. State, 179 A.3d 823 (Table), 2018 WL 559088, at *1 (Del. Jan. 24,\n2018).\n\nPetitioner filed the instant Petition in January 2019, asserting two grounds for relief:\n\n(1) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by: (a) failing to admit exculpatory evidence of\nhis innocence; (b) not objecting to the \u201cshow up\u201d identification of him as the perpetrator of the\ncrime; and (c) failing to investigate impeachment evidence; and (2) his habitual offender sentence\nviolates due process. (D.I. 1)\n\nIII. ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) prescribes a one-\nyear period of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which begins to run\nfrom the latest of:\n\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created\nby State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such\nState action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially\nrecognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to\ncases on collateral review; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims\npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due\n\ndiligence.\n28 US.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling,\nwhich, when applicable, may extend the filing period. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 645 (2010)\n(equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may be excused from\nfailing to comply with the limitations period also by making a gateway showing of actual innocence.\nSee Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4% 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual innocence exception).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 Petition, filed in 2019, is subject to the one-year limitations period\ncontained in \u00a7 2244(d)(1). See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 336 (1997). Petitioner does not allege,\nand the Court cannot discemn, any facts triggering the application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D).\nGiven these circumstances, the one-year period of limitations began to run when Petitioner\u2019s\nconviction became final under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner appeals to a state court but does not seek\ncertiorari review, his judgment of conviction becomes final, and the statute of limitations begins to\nrun, upon expiration of the ninety-day period allowed for seeking certiorari review. See Gonzalez v.\nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012). The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction on\nJune 11, 2015, and he did not seek certiorari review by the United States Supreme Court.\nConsequently, his judgment of conviction became final on September 9, 2015. Applying the one-\n\nyear limitations period to that date, Petitioner had until September 9, 2016 to timely file his Petition.\u2019\n\n'The Court notes that 2016 was a leap year, consisting of 366 days. Nevertheless, \u201c[e]very federal\ncourt that has addressed the issue has concluded that [the] method in [Fed. R. Civ. P. 6], ie., the\n3\nPetitioner waited until January 17, 2019? to file the instant Petition, approximately two years\nand four months after the expiration of the limitations period. Therefore, his habeas Petition is\nuntimely unless the limitations period can be statutorily or equitably tolled, or he demonstrates a\ngateway claim of actual innocence. The Court will discuss each doctrine in turn.\n\nA. Statutory Tolling\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA\u2019s\nlimitations period during the time the action is pending in the state courts, including any post-\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000); Price \u00bb. Taylor,\n2002 WL 31107363, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 23, 2002). The limitations period, however, is not tolled\nduring the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States\nSupreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state post-conviction motion. See Stokes \u00bb. Dist.\nAttorney of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir. 2001). In addition, a post-conviction motion that\nis untimely under state law is not properly filed for \u00a7 2244(d)(2) purposes and, therefore, has no\n\nstatutory tolling effect. See Pace \u00bb. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 414 (2005).\n\n\u2018anniversary\u2019 method, for calculating a time period applies to . .. AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation\nperiod.\u201d Nunez v. Cakfornia, 2014 WL 809206, at *3 2.9 (N.D. Ohio Feb. 25, 2014) (collecting cases);\nsee also Dennis v. Crow, 791 F. App\u2019x 775, 776 (10 Cir. Jan. 29, 2020). \u201cUnder the \u2018anniversary\u2019\nmethod, the first day of the one-year limitations period is the day after the triggering event, thus\ngiving petitioners \u2018until the close of business on the anniversary date of . . .\u2019 the triggering event to\nfile a federal habeas petition.\u201d Id. Using the anniversary method in this case (and, essentially,\nignoring the leap day), results in September 9, 2016 being the last day of AEDPA\u2019s limitations\npetiod.\n\n2Although the Petition was docketed on January 22, 2019, the Petition and envelope postmark are\ndated January 17, 2019. Thus, pursuant to the prison mailbox rule, the Court adopts January 17,\n2019 as the date of filing. See Longenette v. Krusing, 322 F.3d 758, 761 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n4\nHere, thirty-three days of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period elapsed before Petitioner filed a Rule\n61 motion on October 13, 2015. The Superior Court denied the motion, and the Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed that decision on January 24, 2018. Consequently, Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 motion tolled\nthe limitations period from October 13, 2015 through January 24, 2018. The limitations clock\nstarted to run again on January 25, 2018, and ran the remaining 332 days without interruption until\nthe limitations period expired on December 26, 2018. Thus, even with the applicable statutory\ntolling, the Petition is time-barred, unless equitable tolling or the actual innocence gateway exception\napplies.\n\nB. Equitable Tolling\n\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in appropriate cases. See\nHolland, 560 U.S. at 645. A petitioner can only qualify for equitable tolling by demonstrating \u201c(1)\nthat he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) some extraordinary circumstance stood in his\nway and prevented timely filing;\u201d? mere excusable neglect is insufficient. Schlueter v. Varner, 384 F.3d\n69, 77 (ad Cir. 2004). Consistent with these principles, the Third Circuit has limited the equitable\ntolling of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period to the following circumstances:\n\n(1) where the defendant (or the court) actively misled the plaintiff;\n\n(2) where the plaintiff was in some extraordinary way prevented from\nasserting his rights; or\n\n(3) where the plaintiff timely asserted his rights mistakenly in the\nwrong forum.\n\nHolland, 560 US. at 648.\nJones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 159 3d Cir. 1999); see also Thomas v. Snyder, 2001 WL 1555239, at *3-4\n@. Del. Nov. 28, 2001).\n\nPetitioner asserts that defense /appellate counsel\u2019s failure to inform him about AEDPA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations constitutes an extraordinary circumstance for equitable tolling purposes. (D.I.\n11 at 2) Petitioner does not provide any support for this assertion and, in any event, \u201c[a]ttorney\nmiscalculation\u201d of a deadline \u201cis simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\u201d Lawrence \u00bb.\nFlorida, 549 U.S. 327, 336 (2007); see also Johnson v. Hendricks, 314 F.3d 159, 163 3d Cir. 2002)\n(holding that attorney\u2019s mistake in determining date habeas petition is due does not constitute\nextraordinary circumstances for purposes of equitable tolling). Additionally, to the extent\nPetitioner\u2019s untimely filing of the Petition was due to his own ignorance of the law or the result of\nhis miscalculation regarding the one-year filing period, such factors do not warrant equitable\ntolling. See Taylor v. Carroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May 14, 2004).\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that that the doctrine of equitable tolling is not\navailable to Petitioner on the facts he has presented.\n\nC. Actual Innocence\n\nFinally, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that can\novercome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. See McOuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383,\n392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4th at 150-151. A petitioner satisfies the actual innocence exception by\n(1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his innocence; and (2) showing \u201cby a preponderance of the\nevidence\u201d that \u201ca reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new\nevidence.\u201d Wallace, 2 F.4th at 151. Evidence is new for purposes of the actual innocence gateway\neven if it was available for trial counsel through reasonable diligence, if trial counsel\u2019s failure to\ndiscover or present it is alleged as ineffective assistance of counsel. See Reeves \u00bb. Fayette SCI, 897 F.3d\n\n6\n154, 164 (3d Cir. 2018). Neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit has articulated a specific\nstandard for determining whether new innocence-gateway evidence is reliable, but they have\nprovided helpful guideposts. Broadly, three examples of reliable evidence are \u201cexculpatory scientific\nevidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence.\u201d Schiup v. Delo, 513 U.S.\n298, 324 (1995).\n\nPetitioner contends that a May 14, 2014 Gunshot Residue Analysis Report (\u201cGSR Report\u201d)\nconstitutes newly discovered evidence not presented at trial that demonstrates his actual innocence,\npresumably because he interprets the GSR Report as showing there was no gunshot residue on his\nhands. (D.I. 1 at 13; D.I. 1-1; D.I. 1-2 at 2) Defense counsel was awate of the GSR Report in\nadvance of trial but chose not to introduce the Report, and Claim One\u2019s ineffective assistance of\ncounsel allegation is based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the GSR Report during\nPetitioner\u2019s trial. Consequently, the Court finds that the GSR Report constitutes \u201cnew\u201d evidence for\npurposes of the actual innocence gateway. See Reeves, 897 F.3d at 164.\n\nNevertheless, the GSR Report results are inconclusive* and, when considered with the other\n\nevidence presented at Petitioner\u2019s trial, the GSR Report does not show that it is more likely than not\n\n\u2018For instance, the GSR Report explains (1) \u201cone component particles\u201d were found on Petitioner\u2019s\nhands; (2) \u201c[t]wo component and one component particles are found in GSR but may also originate\nfrom other sources;\u201d and (3) \u201c[t]he absence of GSR does not eliminate the possibility that the\nsubject handled or discharged a firearm.\u201d (D.I. 1-1 at 4; see also D.I. 1-2 at 6) In the Court\u2019s view,\nthe fact that the GSR Report results are inconclusive provides a sufficient basis for determining the\nresults do not constitute reliable evidence as contemplated by the first prong of the actual innocence\ngateway inquiry. The Court finds further support for this conclusion after considering the GSR\nReport results in connection with the other evidence presented at trial. See, \u00a2.., Simmons v. Beard, 590\nF.3d 223, 237 (3d Cir. 2009) (in context of Brady claim, after noting that inconclusive test results\n\u201cmay be exculpatory even when they do not provide definitive evidence on a particular issue,\u201d\nexplaining that court is required to \u201cat least consider the potential effect of this evidence on the\njury\u2019s verdict in combination with the other Brady material\u201d).\n\n7\nthat no reasonable juror would have convicted Petitioner of shooting the victim.\u2019 See House \u00bb. Bell,\n547 U.S. 518, 538 (2006). As the Superior Court explained when discussing the GSR Report\u2019s\ninconclusive results during Petitioner\u2019s Rule 61 proceeding, \u201c[b]oth defense and the prosecutor\ncould have argued the [GSR Report] results supported his respective theory of the case.\u201d See\nVickers, 2017 WL 2265104, at *3. Based on the foregoing, the Court is not persuaded that the GSR\nReport constitutes reliable evidence of Petitioner\u2019s actual innocence under the demanding standard\nof McQuiggan and Schlup.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the instant Petition as time-barred \u2018\n\nD. Pending Motion\n\nDuring the pendency of this proceeding, Petitioner filed a Motion for an Extension of Time\nto file a Reply to the State\u2019s Answer, and subsequently filed his Reply. (D.I. 10; D.I. 11) As a result,\nthe Court will deny the Motion for an Extension of Time as moot. The Court considered\nPetitioner\u2019s contentions in the Reply during its review of the instant Petition.\nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether to\nissue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A federal\ncourt denying a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying\n\nconstitutional claims is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner\n\n>The evidence admitted at trial included: (1) Petitioner\u2019s admission to police at the time of the arrest\nthat he had been at the crime scene and had handled the gun; (2) the victim testified he recognized\nthe shooter as Petitioner, a former coworker; and (3) Petitioner had been to the victim\u2019s house on at\nleast one prior occasion. (D.I. 8-2 at 94, 96-100, 102-103; D.I. 8-5 at 1-2; D.L 8-19 at 48)\n\n\u2018Having determined that the Petition is time-barred, the Court will not address the State\u2019s alternate\nreasons for dismissing the Petition.\n8\ndemonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable: (1) whether the petition states a valid\nclaim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its procedural\nruling. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief because it is time-\nbarred. Reasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the Court\ndeclines to issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the instant Petition as time-barred, and the\n\npending Motion as moot. The Court also declines to issue a certificate of appealability. An\n\nappropriate Order will be entered.\n"}
