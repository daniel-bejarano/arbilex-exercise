Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nGeorge Thomas Lees, III], Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice,\nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nAugust L 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\n{a\nREWS, U.\u00a7. District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff Kari Lynn Overington appears pro se. She commenced this lawsuit on\nAugust 4, 2021, and alleges violations of her constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983. (D.I.2). Before the Court are Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and Plaintiff's\nmotion to amend the complaint. (D.I. 8,12). The matters have been fully briefed.\n\n1. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff, who is a cancer survivor, reserved the vanity license plate \u201cFCANCER\u201d\nthrough the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles online reservation process on\nDecember 2, 2020. (D.I. 2 at4). On January 6, 2021, Plaintiff appeared in person at\nthe Dover DMV office and completed the approval process to purchase the vanity plate.\n(id.). She received the vanity plate on February 3, 2020. (/d.).\n\nPlaintiff received a letter dated June 23, 2021 from Defendant Levi Fisher,\ngeneral manager at the Dover DMV, notifying her that the DMV was recalling the\nlicense plate \u201cFCANCER\u201d because it \u201cdoes not represent the State and the Division in a\npositive manner\u201d and \u201cany plate considered offensive in nature will be denied or recalled\nif issued in error.\u201d (/d. at 6). Plaintiff alleges that these statements highlight the\nsubjective nature of the vanity plate process and Fisher's judgment about the meaning\nof \u201cFCANCER.\u201d (/d.). On July 12, 2021, Plaintiff received an email from Defendant\nNicole Majeski, Delaware DOT secretary, confirming the vanity place had been recalled\nand responding to Plaintiff's concerns:\n\n[We also must ensure that we are not approving vanity plates that contain\n\nobscenity, vulgarity, profanity, hate speech or fighting words. Your vanity\n\nplace FCANCER contains a perceived profanity, the abbreviation for the\nwork [sic] \u2018F*@k\u2019, and for that reason, it must be recalled.\n(/d.). Plaintiff alleges that these statements show that regardless of the actual meaning\nof the \u201cFCANCER\u2019 vanity plate, the DMV has perceived profanity and is basing its\ndecision on its perception of the content of Plaintiffs vanity plate message. (/d.).\n\nIn a July 22, 2021 email, Defendant Jana Simpler, Delaware DMV director,\nconfirmed that the vanity place had been recalled, stating \u201cthe word \u201cF*@k\u201d.. . remains\nwithin the definition of profanity, such that it is not appropriate for depiction on a license\nplate issued by the State of Delaware.\u201d (/d.). The Complaint alleges that the\nstatement is \u201cfalse\u201d because the vanity place does not contain the word \u201cfuck.\u201d (/d.).\nPlaintiff alleges that Simpler is drawing a subjective conclusion and enforcing an\narbitrary decision that \u201cFCANCER\u2019 is not appropriate for depiction on a license plate\nissued by the State of Delaware while at the same time there are many other\nacceptable vanity plates on vehicles right now that in Plaintiff's subjective opinion could\nbe considered inappropriate. (/d.).\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants, in their official capacities, violated her First\nAmendment Rights by recalling her vanity plate and imposing content-based and\nviewpoint-based restrictions on her speech. (/d.). She seeks declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. (/d. at 2-3).\n\nDefendants move for dismissal on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted and Defendants have qualified immunity for the\nclaims raised against them in their individual capacities.!. (D.1. 8). Plaintiff opposes\n\nthe motion to dismiss and moves to amend to clarify that the claims are raised against\n\n1 The Court will not address the issue of qualified immunity given that the Court will\ngrant Plaintiffs motion to amend to name Defendants in their official capacities only.\n2\n\nDefendants only in their official capacities. (D.I. 12, 13). Defendants oppose the motion\nto amend on the grounds of futility of amendment. (D.I. 15). The motion to amend will\nbe granted.?\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept\nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to\nplaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds\npro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her complaint, \u201chowever inartfully\npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by\nlawyers.\u201d /d. A court may consider the pleadings, public record, orders, exhibits\nattached to the complaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.\nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Lid., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). A Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion maybe granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as\ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes\nthat those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Aff. Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of\na cause of action.\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014)\n\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). | am \u201cnot required to credit bald assertions or\n\n2\\t is clear from the Complaint that Plaintiff named Defendants in their official capacities,\nbut not clear if she also named them in their individual capacities. (See D.I. 2 at 6).\nThe motion to amend clarifies Plaintiffs claims against Defendants. In addition, the\nComplaint seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, and does not seek compensatory\ndamages.\n\n3\nlegal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.\u201d /n re Rockefeller Ctr. Props.,\nInc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed,\nhowever, \u201cfor imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d\nJohnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014).\n\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \u201csubstantive\nplausibility.\u201d That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the [complainant]\npleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n[accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d /d. Deciding whether a claim is\nplausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its\njudicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d. at 679.\n\nB. Discussion\n\nAttached to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss are documents outside the pleadings.\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that when a motion to dismiss is filed\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not\nexcluded by the Court, the matter shall be treated as one for summary judgment and\ndisposed of as provided in Rule 56. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The Court will not consider\nDefendants\u2019 exhibits and will treat their motion as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b).\n\nIt is well established that under the First Amendment, facial challenges to laws\nthat burden \u201cfree expression\u201d are permitted when \u201ca licensing statute plac[es] unbridled\n\n\u201d\n\ndiscretion in the hands of a government official...\u201d City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer\nPubl\u2019g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988). Challenges have \u201chave been permitted in the\n\nFirst Amendment context where the licensing scheme vests unbridled discretion in the\n4\ndecisionmaker and where the regulation is challenged as overbroad.\u201d FW/PBS, Inc. v.\nCity of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 223 (1990).\n\nConstruing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as the Court must,\nPlaintiff alleges that the Delaware regulations are unconstitutional and her First\nAmendment rights were violated on the basis of viewpoint and in a subjective and\narbitrary manner when she was issued a vanity plate only to have it recalled. Here,\nPlaintiff commenced this action to regain her vanity plate and to have the Delaware\nregulations declared unconstitutional. Both forms of relief are available against the\nState of Delaware as a suit against an individual in his official capacity is the equivalent\nof a suit against the government entity. See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491\nU.S. 58, 71 (1989). Plaintiff adequately alleges a cause of action against Defendants\nin their official capacities. Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss will be denied.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss;\n\nand (2) grant Plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint.\n\nA separate order shall issue.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nKARI LYNN OVERINGTON,\nPlaintiff,\nVv. ; Civil Action No. 21-1133-RGA\nLEVI FISHER, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this. day of August, 2022, consistent with the memorandum\nopinion issued this date,\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (D.1. 8)\nis DENIED.\n\n2. Plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint (D.I. 12) is GRANTED. The\nmatter proceeds against Defendants in their official capacities.\n\n3. Plaintiff has raised a significant constitutional issue. See Ogilvie v.\nGordon, 540 F.Supp. 3d 920 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (holding that a regulation prohibiting the\nDMV from issuing plates \u201cthat may carry connotations offensive to good taste and\ndecency\u201d unconstitutional under the First Amendment); Carroll v. Craddock, 494\nF.Supp. 3d 158 (D.R.1. 2020) (granting preliminary injunction against the DMV in\nconnection with license plate \u201cFKGAS\u201d). While Plaintiff, a non-lawyer, has intelligently\n\npresented her case thus far, | think a constitutional issue of the sort raised here ought to\nbe decided through the adversary process with both sides of the issue being presented\nthrough counsel. Since Plaintiff is not proceeding in forma pauperis, the usual process\nfor getting legal assistance is not available. Plaintiff's email attachments, which suggest\narbitrary decisions by DMV, as well as some cases, at least raise the possibility that\nthere might be need for more of a record than currently exists. Thus, | am going to ask\nthe Clerk\u2019s Office to see whether a lawyer can be obtained to appear as an amicus\n\nsupporting Plaintiff's position.\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n"}
