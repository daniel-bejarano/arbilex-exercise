(D.I. 4).  Upon substitution, the United States then moves, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , to dismiss the case against the United States for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.   (Id.).  Plaintiff did not respond in the time allotted under the Local \nRules of Civil Practice and Procedure of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware \nand the motion is unopposed .  For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the unopposed \nmotion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn October 17, 2022, Plaintiff John Paul Mac Isaac (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) brought this defamation \naction against Cable News Network, Inc. (\u201cCNN\u201d) , Adam Bennett Schiff  (\u201cSchiff\u201d) , Politico LLC  \nand Robert Hunter Biden in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, County of Sussex.  (D.I. 1, \nEx. C ).  On January 20, 2023, he filed a First Amended Complaint (\u201cAmended Complaint\u201d) adding \ndefendant BFPCC, Inc.   (D.I. 1 , Ex. A ).  According to the Amended Complaint, the claims against \nSchiff are based on statements he made during a CNN interview  he participated in as a member of \nCongress.  ( D.I. 1, Ex. A,  Count I ).  On March 7, 2023, the United States  removed this action from \nthe Superior Court of the State  of Delaware pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2).  (D.I. 1).  \nThereafter, the United States move d to substitute itself as defendant for Schiff  under the Federal \nTort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) and then to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction . 2 II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Federal Tort Claims Act  \nThe FTCA is the exclusive remedy for \u201cpersonal injury . . . arising or resulting from the \nnegligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the \nscope of his office or employm ent.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b).  As amended by the Federal Employees \nLiability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (\u201c the Westfall Act\u201d), the FTCA provides a \nmechanism for the United States to substitute itself as defendant for employees sued individually.  Specifically, upon certification by the Attorney General that a  federal employee was acting within \nthe scope of his office or employment at the time of the  incident out of which a state law claim \narises, any civil action arising out of the incident shall  be deemed an action brought against the \nUnited States, and the United States shall be substituted as  sole defendant with respect to those \nclaims.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(1). \nThat certification \u201cis prima facie  evidence that the employee \u2019s challenged conduct \noccurred within the scope of employment, but it is not conclusive.  Thus, a plaintiff challenging \nthe certification has the burden of coming forward with specific facts rebutting it.\u201d  Schrob v. Catterson, 967 F.2d 929, 936 (3d Cir. 1992).  The challenge, however, does not require a hearing. \u201cIf the facts can be determined without an evidentiary hearing, the court can rule on a . . .  motion \nto substitute . . .  based on the certification, pleadings, documentary evidence, and affidavits.\u201d  Id. ; \nsee also Brumfield v. Sanders , 232 F.3d 376, 379\u201380 (3d Cir. 2000) (resolving scope of \nemployment issue as a matter of law  without discovery where Attorney General\u2019s certification was \nbased on facts as alleged in the complaint).  3 B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  A defendant may move to dismiss an \naction for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  In responding to a \nRule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, plaintiff bears the  burden of persuasion in establishing subject \nmatter jurisdiction.   Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 F.2d 1406, 1409 (3d Cir. 1991).  In \nreviewing a facial attack to subject matter  jurisdiction, \u201cthe court must only consider the \nallegations of the complaint  and docume nts referenced therein and attached thereto, in the light \nmost favorable to the  plaintiff.\u201d  Gould Elecs., Inc. v. United States , 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. \n2000).  To sue the  sovereign, plaintiff\u2019s allegations must invoke a valid waiver of sovereign \nimmunity.   F.D.I.C. v. Meyer , 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Request for Substitution \n\u201cWhen a federal employee is sued for wrongful or  negligent conduct, the [Westfall] Act \nempowers the Attorney General to certify that the  employee \u2018was acting within the scope of his \noffice or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.\u2019\u201d  Osborn v. Haley, \n549 U.S. 225, 229\u201330 (2007) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2)).  Once the Attorney General \ncertifies that the defendant federal employee was  acting within the scope of his employment at the \nrelevant time, the statute itself provides that the  United States \u201cshall\u201d be substituted as the sole \ndefendant in the action.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2).  \u201c[T]he Westfall Act certification must be \nrespect ed unless and until the District Court determines that [the federal employee], in fact, \nengaged in conduct beyond the scope of his  employment.\u201d  Osborn, 549 U.S. at 251 (original \nitalics omitted).  4 Here, James G. Touhey, Jr., the Director of the Torts Branch of the Civil Division of the \nUnited States  Department of Justice, acting pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.4(a), issued a Westfall Act \ncertification  that Schiff was acting within the scope of his employment as a m ember of  Congress \nat the time of the incidents o ut of which the plaintiff\u2019s defamation claims arose.  (D.I. 1, Ex. B ).  \nThat certification is prima facie  evidence that Schiff\u2019s challenged conduct occurred within the \nscope of employment .  The burden thus shifts to Plaintiff to come forward with \u201c specific facts \nrebutting it.\u201d  Schrob, 967 F.2d at 936. \nIn his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff offers conclusory allegations that Schiff was not \nacting in the scope of his employment.  ( E.g., D.I. 1, Ex . A \u204b 72 (\u201cSCHIFF was not carrying out \nany of his implied powers as a member of Congress.\u201d); see also  D.I. 1, Ex. A \u204b\u204b 71, 73 -76).  He \nalso, however, alleged that Schiff was asked questions and gave answers during the CNN interview \nin his capacity as a member of Congress.  ( E.g., D.I. 1, Ex. A \u204b  62 (\u201cHave you, as a member of the \nGang of Eight, the top leadership in Congress, the Senate, and the House, and members of the Intelligence Committee . . .\u201d.); D.I. 1, Ex. A \u204b 63 (\u201cWell, I was in the Intelligence Committee today to see what the latest was . . .\u201d .)).  Such conclusory (and somewhat contradictory) allegations \ncannot overcome the prima facie  evidence of the certification.   Thus, t he Westfall Act requires the \nsubstitution of the United States as  defendant in this action. \nB. Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \nTo advance a tort claim  against the United States  under the FTCA , a plaintiff must establish \nthat he complied with the administrative  presentment requirements of the Act .  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675. \n\u201c[P]laintiff bears the burden of  establishing that hi s claims fall within the scope of the FTCA\u2019s \nwaiver of the federal  government\u2019s sovereign immunity.\u201d  S.R.P. ex rel. Abunabba v. United \nStates , 676 F.3d 329, 333 (3d Cir. 2012).  To do so, P laintiff must \u201cfirst present[] the claim to the 5 appropriate Federa l agency,\u201d and that agency must either deny  the claim in writing or not act on \nthe claim for a period of six months.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a).   \nThis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over FTCA claims if plaintiffs \u201cinstitute[]\u201d \n\u201c[a]n  action\u201d before exhausting their administrative remedies.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b)(1), 2675(a);  \nMcNeil v. United States , 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993).  Indeed, the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2675(a) are  \u201cjurisdictional and cannot be waived.\u201d   Roma v. United State s, 344 F.3d 352, 362 \n(3d Cir. 2003).  Here, plaintiff has not alleged that he exhausted his administrative remedies  under \nthe FTCA before instituting this action.  Thus, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction  over the \naction as to the claims against the United States standing in for Schiff.1 \nC. Remand  \nThe causes of action alleged in this matter are all state law claims.  The United States \nproperly removed this action  pursuant to the FTCA.  The United States, however, has been \ndismissed from this case .  In light of that, the Court will remand the remainder of this case to the \nSuperior Court for the State of Delaware. \nIV CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States motion to substitute itself for defendant Schiff \nis granted .  Once substituted, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action against the \nUnited States because Plaintiff has failed to exhaus t his administrative remedies.  This case will \nbe remanded.  An appropriate order will issue. \n \n1  The United States also moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the \nFTCA\u2019s libel and slander exception in 28 U.S.C. \u00a72680(h).  (D.I. 4).  Given the Court\u2019s conclusion that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction for failure to exhaust, it does not address the libel and slander exception.
