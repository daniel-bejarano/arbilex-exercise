(collectively, J&J) have sued Defendants Alcon \nVision, LLC, Alcon Laboratories, Inc., and Alcon Research, LLC (collectively, \nAlcon) for patent and copyright infringement. Pending before me is Alcon's \nMotion for Summary Judgment (No. 1) That the Copyright Act Bars Monetary \nRelief for Infringing Acts Occurring More Than Three Years Before J&J Filed \nSuit. D.I. 355. Alcon seeks by its motion a declarator y judgment that J&J is \n\"barred from recovering monetary relief for acts that occurred before September \n28, 2017 .\" D.I. 355-1 at 2. \nI. BACKGROUND \nJ&J manufactures the iFS\u00ae Laser, a laser system used for eye surgery that \nemploys copyrighted computer software. Alcon markets the LenSx\u00ae Laser System \n(LenSx), a laser-assisted cataract surgery system. \nIn 2014, J&J obtained a LenSx device and inspected the object code \ninstalled on that device. \"Object code is machine readable, binary code, \nrepresented on paper as a series of ones and zeroes.\" Atari Games Corp. v. \nNintendo of Am. Inc., 975 F.2d 832,836 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1992). It is distinguished \nfrom but related to source code, which is \"the text of a software program written in a human-readable programming language.\" Blueport Co., LLC v. United States, \n533 F.3d 1374, 1377 n.l (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). \"Once written, source \ncode is compiled into machine-readable object code that runs on a computer.\" Id. \n( citation omitted). \"Software programmers usually provide users with only the \nobject code in order to prevent users from modifying the program.\" Id. (citation \nomitted). \nIn June 2020, J&J initiated this case with the filing of a complaint in which \nit alleged that the LenSx infringes numerous patents owned by J&J. D.I. 1. On \nSeptember 28, 2020, J&J filed the First Amended Complaint and alleged for the \nfirst time that LenSx' s software \"incorporate[ s] one or more protected elements of \nthe copyrighted iFS\u00ae Laser computer programs.\" D.I. 16 ,r,r 99, 101, 103-04. In \nparagraph 98 of its First Amended Complaint, J&J alleged: \nAlcon unlawfully used and is continuing to use \nJ&J['s] ... copyrighted computer programs (or \ncopyrightable elements thereof) as part of the software \nthat operates the LenSx. The installed version of the \nLenSx software (at least as of Version 2.20.02) exhibits \nan overwhelming number of telltale signs of copying of \nJ&J['s] ... copyrighted computer programs, including \nbut not limited to the following: \na. The LenSx\u00ae file system mirrors the file \nstructure of an iFS\u00ae Laser, with file folders with identical \nnames .... \nb. The LenSx\u00ae includes a number of on-screen \ninstructions identical to those on an iFS\u00ae Laser, right \n2 D.I. 16 ,r 98. down to the punctuation and nonstandard \ncapitalization .... \nc. The LenSx object code files include[] over 300 \nreferences to file, function, and object names and other \ntext that are identical to and originate in the iFS\u00ae Laser \nsource code-far too many to be mere coincidence. \nd. The object code file for the LenSx software \nmodule controlling the beam steering process \n(beam_ control) references unique function names that \nwere originally in the iFS\u00ae Laser source code .... The \nsame object code file includes at least fifty unique data \nobject names that were originally in the iFS\u00ae Laser \nsource code .... That file also contains error codes and \nother text that are identical to, and originate in, the iFS\u00ae \nLaser source code .... \ne. The object code file for the LenSx software \nmodule responsible for positioning the laser to the proper \nposition (scanners) includes at least seventeen unique \nfunction names ... that [are] identical to, and originate \nin, the iFS\u00ae Laser source code. \nf. The LenSx exhibits similar or identical \nbehaviors to various error conditions [in the iFS\u00ae \nLaser] .... \ng. Both the iFS \u00ae Laser and LenSx systems register \nprocess names with the operating system to facilitate \ninterprocess communication. . . . The LenSx contains \nregistered process names that are identical to those in the \niFS\u00ae Laser, even where the underlying process files in \nthe LenSx do not match the corresponding process \nname .... This in particular is evidence that Alcon \nattempted to cover up the evidence of copying by \nchanging certain names. \n3 J&J admits that by the end of 2014, it \"possessed the facts underlying [its] \ncopyright allegations as presented in the First Amended Complaint.\" D.I. 372 at \n80; see also D.I. 372 at 20; D.I. 421 at 2. In a letter sent to Alcon on July 14, 2020, \nJ&J stated that it \"ha[d] every reason to believe that [Alcon] ... copied [J&J's] \nproprietary source and/or object code, which [it] then incorporated into the \nLenSx\u00ae.\" D.I. 372 at 12. J&J also stated in that letter that \"[i]f Alcon believes that \nit is not infringing [J&J's] copyrighted computer programs, we invite Alcon to \nshare with us all released versions of its source code from July 2017 to the \npresent.\" D.I. 372 at 12. \nFour months later, in November 2020, J&J obtained through discovery in \nthis case access to the LenSx source code. D.I. 427-1 at 199-200. On June 17, \n2021, J&J filed its Second Amended Complaint, in which it added two counts of \nalleged infringement by Alcon of copyrighted submissions to the United States \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), internal technical documentation, and the \niFS\u00ae Laser operator's manual. D.I. 141 ,r,r 456-64. \nJ &J also alleged in the Second Amended Complaint that its inspection of \nAlcon's source code \"led to the discovery that Alcon had stolen electronic copies \nof the iFS\u00ae Laser source code, and incorporated at least 26,000 lines of that code \nwholesale into the LenSx computer program-including typos and dates from well \nbefore development of the LenSx began.\" D.I. 141 ,r 105. \n4 II. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA court must grant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are those \"that could affect \nthe outcome\" of the proceeding. Lamont v. New Jersey, 63 7 F .3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. \n2011). \"[A] dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to \npermit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party.\" Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted). A non-moving party asserting that a fact is genuinely \ndisputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing to particular parts of \nmaterials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored \ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, ... admissions, interrogatory \nanswers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the \nopposing party] do not establish the absence ... of a genuine dispute.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(c)(l). The non-moving party's evidence \"must amount to more than a \nscintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a \npreponderance.\" Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-61 \n(3d Cir. 1989). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nAlcon argues that the Copyright Act has a three-year statute of limitations \nthat bars J&J from seeking monetary relief for acts that occurred before September \n5 28, 2017-i.e., three years before J&J filed its First Amended Complaint. D.I. 356 \nat 4. \nSection 507(b) of the Copyright Act provides that \"[n]o civil action shall be \nmaintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three \nyears after the claim accrued.\" In William A. Graham Co. v. Haughey, 568 F.3d \n425, 437 (3d Cir. 2009), the Third Circuit held that \"the federal discovery rule \ngoverns the accrual of civil claims brought under the Copyright Act.\" \nAccordingly, under Graham, a copyright claim \"accrues when the plaintiff \ndiscovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the injury that forms the \nbasis for the claim.\" Id. at 433 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nAlcon argues that the Supreme Court effectively overruled Graham in \nPetrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 512 U.S. 663 (2014). See D.I. 456 at 1. \nThe Court held in Petrella that the equitable doctrine of laches \"cannot be invoked \nto preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the three-year \nwindow\" of\u00a7 507(b). 572 U.S. at 667. Alcon argues that certain statements made \nby the Court in Petrella preclude a plaintiff from using the discovery rule to \nrecover damages for copyright claims filed more than three years after the \ninfringing acts occurred. It points specifically to the Court's statements in Petrella \nthat \"[u]nder the Act's three-year provision, an infringement is actionable within \nthree years, and only three years, of its occurrence,\" 572 U.S. at 671 (quoted at D.I. \n6 356 at 4), that \"a successful plaintiff can gain retrospective relief only three years \nback from the time of suit,\" id at 677 (quoted at D.I. 356 at 4), and that \"[n]o \nrecovery may be had for infringement in earlier years,\" id. ( quoted at D.I. 356 at \n4). \nAlcon's argument has some initial appeal. But the Court also stated in \nPetrella that \"[a]lthough we have not passed on the question, nine Courts of \nAppeals have adopted, as an alternative to the incident of injury rule, a 'discovery \nrule,' which starts the limitations period when 'the plaintiff discovers, or with due \ndiligence should have discovered, the injury that forms the basis for the claim,\"' \nand the Court cited Graham in support of this statement. 572 U.S. at 670 n.4 \n(emphasis added) (citing Graham, 568 F.3d at 433). Three years later, in SCA \nHygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC, 137 S. Ct. 954 \n(2017), the Court stated that \"in Petrella, we specifically noted that 'we have not \npassed on the question' whether the Copyright Act's statute of limitations is \ngoverned by [the discovery] rule.\" Id. at 962 (quoting Petrella, 512 U.S. at 670 \nn.4). In light of these explicit confirmations that the Court was not addressing in \nPetrella whether the injury rule or the discovery rule applied to copyright claims, I \ndo not think it can be said that Petrella adopted the injury rule over the discovery \nrule or that it overruled Graham. Thus, Graham remains binding precedent in the \nThird Circuit. See also Am. Bd. of Internal Med. v. Rushford, 841 F. App 'x 440, \n7 441 (3d Cir. 2020) (reaffirming Graham without any discussion of Petrella and \nreversing district court ruling that injury rule applied to copyright claims). \nAlcon also seems to argue that Petrella imposed a damages bar separate \nfrom the statute of limitations, as it points to the Second Circuit's decision in Sohm \nv. Scholastic, Inc., 959 F.3d 39 (2d Cir. 2020), as \"instructive.\" D.I. 356 at 6. In \nSohm, the Court rejected the argument that Petrella cast serious doubt on Second \nCircuit precedent that mandated application of the discovery rule in copyright \ncases. 959 F. 3d at 50. But based on the same language from Petrella that Alcon \nrelies on here, the Court held that \"a plaintiff's recovery is limited to damages \nincurred during the three years prior to filing suit.\" Id. at 52. \nThe Ninth Circuit in Starz Entertainment, LLC v. MGM Domestic Television \nDistribution, LLC, 39 F .4th 1236, 1244 (9th Cir. 2022), agreed with the Second \nCircuit that Petrella left in place the discovery rule for copyright claims, but it \nrejected Sohm' s holding that Petrella dictated a limitation on recovery of damages. \nIn the Starz court's view, applying a separate damages rule would eviscerate the \ndiscovery rule and \"[b]y purporting to apply the discovery rule but imposing a \nthree-year damages bar, Sohm is inherently self-contradictory.\" Id. \nAlthough not without doubt about the implications of Petrella, I agree with \nthe Ninth Circuit that it does not make sense to preserve the discovery rule and at \nthe same time preclude a plaintiff who is supposed to benefit from the rule from \n8 recovering damages. Accordingly, I will apply the discovery rule here and not \nimpose a bar on damages separate from the statute of limitations. 1 \nAlcon argues in the alternative that even if the discovery rule applies to \ncopyright claims and there is no separate bar on damages, J&J's claim that Alcon \ninfringed J&J's copyrighted source code is barred by\u00a7 507(b) because it is \nundisputed that J&J knew as of 2014 of the facts underlying the copyright claims it \nalleged in the First Amended Complaint. D.I. 356 at 1. J&J counters that \"there \nare genuine disputes as to whether and when J&J reasonably could have \n1 In doing so, I am following the vast majority of district courts that have \npreviously addressed the issue.

Aug. 26, 2022); \nNavarro v. Procter & Gamble Co., 515 F. Supp. 3d 718, 761-62 (S.D. Ohio 2021), \nreconsideration denied, 2021 WL 913103 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 10, 2021); Nealy v.

Va. 2020). \n9 discovered Alcon's infringement of its iFS implementing source code.\" D.I. 417 at \n9. According to J&J, it \"could not reasonably have known\" before it had access to \nthe LenSx source code in November 2020 \"that Alcon had injured J&J in a distinct \nmanner, by copying J&J's implementing source code.\" D.I. 417 at 9-10. \nJ&J' s position is belied by its admission made in response to a discovery \nrequest that \"as of the end of 2014, [it] possessed the facts underlying [its] \ncopyright allegations as presented in the First Amended Complaint.\" D.I. 372 at \n80; see also D.I. 372 at 20; D.I. 421 at 2. It is further belied by J&J's assertion in \nthe letter it sent Alcon on July 14, 2020-four months before it had access to the \nLenSx source code-that it \"ha[ d] every reason to believe that [Alcon] ... copied \n[J&J's] proprietary source and/or object code, which [it] then incorporated into the \nLenSx\u00ae.\" D.I. 372 at 12. J&J's position can also not be squared with the specific \nallegations in the First Amended Complaint that the LenSx object code revealed \n\"over 300 references to file, function, and object names and other text that are \nidentical to and originate in the iFS\u00ae Laser source code,\" \"unique function names \nthat were originally in the iFS\u00ae Laser source code,\" \"at least fifty unique data \nobject names that were originally in the iFS\u00ae Laser source code,\" \"error codes and \nother text that are identical to, and originate in, the iFS\u00ae Laser source code,\" and \n\"at least seventeen unique function names ... that [are] identical to, and originate \nin, the iFS\u00ae Laser source code.\" D.I. 16 ,r 98. \n10 J&J insists that the source code it referred to in the First Amended \nComplaint is \"declaring\" source code, as opposed to \"implementing\" source code. \nD.I. 417 at 10-11. But even if there were a distinction between declaring and \nimplementing source code, J&J alleged in the First Amended Complaint that Alcon \nhad copied J&J's \"source code.\" D.I. 16 ,r 98. It did not distinguish between \ndeclaring and implementing source code and it did not limit its allegations of \ncopying to declaring source code. Moreover, J&J' s admitted knowledge of the \nfacts underlying its allegation of copying the iFS source code put it at the very least \non inquiry notice that Alcon was copying source code-i.e., declaring, \nimplementing, and all other types of source code. Accordingly, it is J&J's burden \nto demonstrate that it exercised reasonable diligence to discover the injury that \nforms the basis of its claims. Graham, 568 F.3d at 433. But J&J points to no \nactions it took to obtain the LenSx source code before it sent Alcon the July 14, \n2020 letter in which it \"invite[d]\" Alcon to share its source code with J&J. See \nD.I. 372 at 12. \nJ&J also cites the reports of its experts, Mr. Nikolaus Baer and Dr. Douglas \nSchmidt, for the proposition that \"a person with access to the object code could not \nsee the implementing code.\" D.I. 417 at 11. But Mr. Baer and Dr. Schmidt opined \nonly that without access to the LenSx source code they were unable to discern the \nfull extent of Alcon's copying. See D.I. 427-1, Ex.I ,r 166 (\"[A] developer with \n11 access to this object code and the iFS source code could not determine the full \nextent of the copying present in the LenSx source code.\") (Baer); D.I. 427-1, Ex. 7 \n,r 28 (\"[ A ]!though it is obvious from the LenSx source code that extensive portions \nof implementing code for functions were copied from the iFS source code and that \nthis copied implementing code is actually used in the software, it would be \nexceedingly challenging, if not impossible, to discern the full extent of the copying \nand use of the copied source code from only the LenSx 2.20 executable.\") (Baer); \nD.I. 427-1, Ex. 8 ,r 7 (\"[O]ne could expect to learn from the LenSx object code ... \nsome human-readable strings, including some evidence that the declaring code was \ncopied-but not a clear picture of the massive extent of the copying, such as \nwholesale duplication of large chunks of implementing code[].\") (Baer); D.I. 427-\n1, Ex. 2 ,r 357 (\"[The] function names, error messages, and data structures present \nin the LenSx object code file that match corresponding features in the iFS source \ncode ... do not, alone, provide a meaningful window into the full extent of the \ncopying that is observable from the source code.\") (Schmidt); D.I. 427-1, Ex. 9 \n,r 71 (\"[A]lthough [J&J] was able to observe some evidence of similarities to the \niFS source code in the LenSx object code, the information at [J&J's] disposal did \nnot provide a meaningful window into the full extent of the copying reflected in the \nLenSx source code.\") ( emphasis in the original) (Schmidt). \n12 \"A plaintiff's ignorance regarding the full extent of his injury is irrelevant to \nthe discovery rule's application, so long as the plaintiff discovers or should have \ndiscovered that he was injured.\" Stephens v. Clash, 796 F.3d 281,288 (3d Cir. \n2015) (citations omitted); see also Kach v. Hose, 589 F.3d 626, 635 (3d Cir. 2009) \n(holding that statute of limitations begins to run \"even though the full extent of the \ninjury is not then known or predictable\" (quoting Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, \n391 (2007))). \"Were it otherwise, the statute would begin to run only after a \nplaintiff became satisfied that he had been harmed enough, placing the supposed \nstatute of repose in the sole hands of the party seeking relief.\" Stephens, 796 F.3d \nat 288 (quoting Wallace, 549 U.S. at 391). \nBecause J&J had sufficient information as of2014 to place it at the very \nleast on inquiry notice that Alcon was copying the source code of J &J's iFS \ncomputer programs and it failed to exercise reasonable diligence to discover before \nJuly 2020 the injury it may have suffered from the infringement of that source \ncode, it cannot recover damages for infringement of its copyrighted computer \nprograms that took place more than three years before September 28, 2020. See \nGraham, 568 F.3d at 438. \nFinally, Alcon argues in a footnote that \"[t]he discovery rule likewise does \nnot save J&J' s claims concerning copying of iFS Laser FDA submissions, internal \ntechnical documentation, and operator's manual.\" D.I. 356 at 9 n.3. This \"passing \n13 reference to an issue will not suffice to bring that issue before this \ncourt.\" Skretvedt v. E.1 DuPont De Nemours, 372 F.3d 193, 202-03 (3d Cir. \n2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also John Wyeth & Bro. \nLtd. v. CIGNA Int'/ Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"[A]rguments \nraised in passing ( such as, in a footnote), but not squarely argued, are \nconsidered waived.\" ( citation omitted)). In any event, there appears to be a \ngenuine dispute of material fact concerning when exactly J&J reasonably could \nhave discovered the copying of its FDA submissions, internal technical \ndocumentation, and iFS operator's manual. Compare D.I. 421 ,r,r 4, 15, with D.I. \n457,r,r 4, 15. That dispute necessarily defeats a motion for summary judgment. \nSee Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,248 (1986) (holding that \nsummary judgment will not lie if there is a genuine dispute about a material fact). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, I find that Alcon has shown, and J &J has \nnot adduced record evidence to rebut, the absence of a genuine factual dispute \nabout whether J&J had sufficient information as of 2014 to place it at the very least \non inquiry notice that Alcon was copying the source code of J&J's iFS computer \nprograms and whether J &J failed to exercise reasonable diligence to discover \nbefore July 2020 the injury it may have suffered from the infringement of that \nsource code. Accordingly, I will grant Alcon's summary judgment motion to the \n14 extent it seeks a declaration that J&J is barred from recovering monetary relief for \ninfringement of its iFS computer programs that occurred before September 28, \n2017. I will otherwise deny the motion. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n15 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAMO DEVELOPMENT, LLC, \nAMO MANUFACTURING USA, \nLLC and AMO SALES AND \nSERVICE, INC., \nPlaintiffs, \nV. \nALCON VISION, LLC, ALCON \nLABORATORIES, INC. and \nALCON RESEARCH, LLC \nDefendants.
