(\"Debtor''), and (ii) granted the Trustee an extension of \nthe expired deadline to properly effectuate service of process in accordance with \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 4, as made applicable to the adversary proceeding by \nFederal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7004. The Court has considered the Trustee's \nresponse. (D.I. 2). No party requested oral argument. For the reasons set forth below, \nB&T' s Motion for Leave is granted in part and denied in part. \n1. Background. On May 13, 2019 (the \"Petition Date\"), the Debtor filed \na voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On the Petition Date, \nthe Debtor also filed its Motion for Interim and Final Orders Pursuant to 11 U.S. C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 105, 361, 362, 363, 364, 503 and 507 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002, 4001, 6004 and \n9014 (i) Authorizing Debtor to Obtain Senior Secured, Superproriority, Postpetition \nFinancing, (ii) Granting Liens and Superpriority Claims, (iii) Approving Use of Cash \nCollateral of Prepetition Lenders, (iv) Granting Adequate Protection to Prepetition \nLenders, (v) Modifying the Automatic Stay, (vi) Scheduling Final Hearing, and (vii) \nGranting Related Relief(B.D.I. 7) (the \"DIP Motion\"). Paragraph 12(a) of the DIP \nMotion designates Debtor's prepetition secured lenders as JRV Group Holding USA \nL.P. (\"Holding\") and Comer Flag LLC ( the \"Prepetition Lenders\"). Prior to and after \nthe Petition Date, B&T represented Holding as its attorneys. \n2. Based on certain representations in the DIP Motion, the Debtor released \nany claims or causes of action against any of the Prepetition Lenders or any of their \nrespective affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, \n2 members, managers, agents, attorneys, advisors, professionals, predecessors in \ninterest, successors and assigns (solely in their respective capacities as such) \n(collectively, the \"Prepetition Released Parties\"). On May 15, 2019, the Bankruptcy \nCourt entered an interim order granting the DIP Motion (B.D.I. 29) (the \"Interim DIP \nOrder\"). On August 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the final order granting \nthe DIP Motion (B.D.I. 473) (the \"Final DIP Order\"). The Final DIP Order reaffirms \nthe stipulations, waivers, and releases contained in the DIP Motion (Final DIP Order \nat 6-12) and provides that such stipulations, waivers, and releases would not become \neffective until \"the effective date of a chapter 11 plan.\" (Id. at 3 5). \n3. On August 6, 2020, the Debtor filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court \n(B.D.I. 474) identifying August 5, 2020, as the \"Effective Date\" of the Debtor's \nchapter 11 plan of liquidation. \n4. On September 14, 2021, the Trustee filed its Complaint to Avoid and \nRecover Transfers Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 547, 548, 549, and 550 and to Disallow \nClaims Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 (Adv. D.I. 1) (the \"Complaint\"), seeking to \nrecover allegedly preferential and fraudulent transfers totaling $551,439.61 from \nB&T. The Bankruptcy Court's docket entry for the filing of the Complaint states, \n\"AP Summons Served due date: 12/13/2021.\" \n5. After filing the Complaint, counsel for the Trustee sent an email to \ncounsel for B&T (the \"First Email\") stating, \"Attached please find a time-stamped \ncopy of the complaint filed today in this matter and let us know if you will accept \n3 service of it on behalf of B&T.\" Counsel for B&T sent a response email to counsel \nfor the Trustee (the \"Second Email\") stating, \"Yes, I will accept service.\" \n6. The parties' counsel exchanged many communications in the following \nmonths regarding B&T's position that the release contained in the Final DIP Order \nprecluded the complaint. However, from the filing of the Complaint on September \n14, 2021, through December 8, 2021, no further filings were made in the adversary \nproceeding. On December 8, 2021, the Trustee filed an Affidavit of Service (Adv. \nD .I. 3) ( the \"Service Affidavit\"), whereby counsel for the Trustee stated that he \ncaused a copy of the Complaint to be served on B&T. The Service Affidavit did not \nreference any summons. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m), made applicable to \nthe Adversary Proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7004, required \nthe Trustee to serve a summons on B&T by December 13, 2021. The Trustee did not \nfile a summons with the Court and therefore did not serve a summons on B&T by the \ndeadline. \n7. On December 14, 2021, after the deadline for service of process had \npassed, a representative of the Bankruptcy Court reached out to the Trustee's counsel \nto inquire about the fact that a summons had not been filed and whether the Trustee \nintended to proceed with the case. The Trustee's counsel advised that B&T had \naccepted service of the Complaint on September 14, 2021. The court's representative \nasked the Trustee's counsel to submit an additional affidavit confirming that B&T \nagreed to waive the necessity of a summons. \n4 8. Despite emails to B&T's counsel on December 15 and 16, 2021 seeking \nsuch a waiver, the Trustee did not obtain one. On December 17, 2021, B&T filed its \nMotion to Dismiss and brief in support, seeking to dismiss the Complaint in its \nentirety based on, inter alia, lack of personal jurisdiction ( due to the failure to timely \nobtain and serve a summons) and the failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted (based on the releases contained in the Interim DIP Order and the Final DIP \nOrder). On January 14, 2022, the Trustee filed its opposition (Adv. D.I. 7). The \nTrustee argued that the Bankruptcy Court had broad discretion under Rule 4(m) to \nextend the time for service (See id. at 6). The Trustee further argued that while \nB&T was released \"solely in their respective capacit[y ]\" as counsel to the Prepetition \nLenders, the Complaint alleged claims against B&T in its capacity as counsel to the \nDebtors to recover preferential and fraudulent transfers from the Debtors, and that \nneither of the DIP Orders provided for a release of these claims. (See id. at 9). On \nJanuary 28, 2022, B&T filed its reply in further support (Adv. D.I. 8), and on January \n31, 2022, the Trustee filed a request for oral argument (Adv. D.I. 9). \n9. On February 24, 2022, the Honorable Christopher S. Sontchi2 entered \nthe Order, denying the Motion to Dismiss \"without prejudice\" and granting the \nTrustee an additional \"sixty (60) days from the date of this Order to properly \n2 In accordance with a subsequent Order issued on March 18, 2022, the Debtor's \nchapter 11 case ( and Adversary Proceeding) was re-assigned to the Honorable Karen \nB. Owens. (B.D.I. 566). \n5 effectuate service of process in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, as made applicable \nto this proceeding by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7004.\" (Order ,r,r 1-2). The Order contains \nno further explanation. \n10. On February 28, 2022, B&T was served with a summons and the \nComplaint, both by first class mail to its Delaware registered agent and by personal \nservice upon a B&T partner in B&T's Wilmington, Delaware office. \n11. On March 10, 2022, B&T appealed the Order. (Adv. D.I. 14). B&T \nseeks leave to appeal the interlocutory Order with respect to two issues: ( 1) whether \nthe Bankruptcy Court erred in not dismissing the Complaint for lack of personal \njurisdiction as a matter of law (\"Jurisdiction Ruling\"), and (2) whether the \nBankruptcy Court erred in determining that B&T was not released in accordance with \nthe express language of the Interim DIP Order and/or the Final DIP Order as a matter \nof law (\"Release Ruling\"). On appeal, B&T would argue that it is undisputed that the \nTrustee failed to obtain a summons from the Bankruptcy Court, and under controlling \nThird Circuit law, Ayres v. Jacobs & Crumplar, P.A., 99 F.3d 565 (3d Cir. 1996), the \nBankruptcy Court was required to dismiss the case. B&T argues that, without a \nsummons, the Bankruptcy Court lacked personal jurisdiction over B&T, in which \ncase \"it becomes unnecessary for the district courts to consider such questions as \nwhether service was properly made, or whether an extension to the 120-dayl31 service \n3 The Third Circuit's Ayers decision was issued in 1996, prior to the 2015 \nAmendment to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) pursuant to which \"[t]he \n6 period should be granted under Rule 4(m).\" (D.1. 3 at 7 (quoting Ayers, 99 F.3d at \n569). \"The failure of a plaintiff to obtain valid process from the court to provide it \nwith personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a civil case is/ atal to the plaintiffs \ncase.\" Ayers, 99 F.3d at 569 (emphasis added). \n12. Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals \"with leave of \nthe court, from interlocutory orders and decrees, of bankruptcy judges entered in \ncases and proceedings referred to the bankruptcy judges under section 157 of this \ntitle.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). Section 158(a) does not identify the standard district \ncourts should use in deciding whether to grant such an interlocutory appeal. See id. \n\"Typically, however, district courts follow the standards set forth under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1292(b ), which govern interlocutory appeals from a district court to a court of \nappeals.\" In re AE Liquidation, Inc., 451 B.R. 343, 346 (D. Del. 2011).4 \n13. Under the standards of section 1292(b ), an interlocutory appeal is \npermitted only when the order at issue (1) involves a controlling question of law upon \nwhich there is (2) substantial ground for difference of opinion as to its correctness, \npresumptive time for serving a defendant is reduced from 120 days to 90 days.\" Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 4 (advisory committee's notes to 2015 amendment). \"This change, \ntogether with the shortened times for issuing a scheduling order set by amended Rule \n16{b)(2), will reduce delay at the beginning of litigation.\" Id. \n4 See also In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC, 418 B.R. 548, 556 (E.D. Pa. 2009) \n(\"Based upon the decision of the Third Circuit in Bertoli v. D 'Avella (In re Bertoli), \n812 F.2d 136, 139 (3d Cir. 1987), courts within this Circuit confronted with the \ndecision whether to grant leave to allow an interlocutory appeal are informed by the \ncriteria in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b ).\"). \n7 and (3) if appealed immediately, may materially advance the ultimate termination of \nthe litigation. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b); Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, \n754 (3d Cir. 1974). Entertaining review ofan interlocutory order under\u00a7 1292(b) is \nappropriate only when the party seeking leave to appeal \"establishes exceptional \ncircumstances [to] justify a departure from the basic policy of postponing review until \nafter the entry of final judgment.\" In re Del. and Hudson Ry. Co., 96 B.R. 469, 472-\n73 (D. Del. 1989), ajf'd, 884 F.2d 1383 (3d Cir. 1989). In part, this stems from the \nfact that \"[p]iecemeal litigation is generally disfavored by the Third Circuit.\" In re \nSemCrude, L.P., 2010 WL 4537921, at *2 (D. Del. Oct. 26, 2010) (citing In re White \nBeauty View, Inc., 841 F.2d 524, 526 (3d Cir. 1988)). Further, leave for interlocutory \nappeal may be denied for \"entirely unrelated reasons such as the state of the appellate \ndocket or the desire to have a full record befo~e considering the disputed legal issue.\" \nKatz, 496 F .2d at 754. \n14. Discussion. With respect to the first issue B&T seeks leave to appeal, I \nconclude that the Jurisdictional Ruling is appropriate for interlocutory review under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). \n15. With respect to the first prong of the\u00a7 1292(b) analysis, the Order rules \non a controlling question of law. \"A controlling question of law must encompass at \nthe very least every order which, if erroneous, would be reversible error on final \nappeal.\" Katz, 496 F.2d at 755. A \"clear case\" of a controlling question of law is \n\"one which would result in a reversal of a judgment after final hearing.\" Id. The \n8 underlying policy of this prong of\u00a7 1292(b) is to protect parties \"from a possibly \nerroneous interlocutory order and the avoidance of possibly wasted trial time and \nlitigation expense.\" Id. at 756. Here, if it is determined that the Bankruptcy Court \ndid not have personal jurisdiction over B&T, then the Complaint must be dismissed. \nThe first prong of the\u00a7 1292(b) analysis is therefore satisfied. See, e.g., Facebook \nInc. v. Namecheap Inc., 2021 WL 961771, at *3 (D. Ariz. March 15, 2021) \n( certifying interlocutory appeal based on denial of motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(2)); Gilmore v. Jones, 2019 WL 4417490, at *3 (W.D. Va. Sept. 16, \n2019) (holding that denial of motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) \nwould be a \"controlling\" question where all but one defendant would be dismissed if \nmotion were granted, and citing Katz); Astrazeneca AB v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., \n2014 WL 7533913, at *1 n.1 (D. Del. Dec. 17, 2014) (granting motion for \ncertification of interlocutory appeal based on denial of motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction). \n16. As to the second prong, there is also substantial ground for a difference \nof opinion as to the Jurisdictional Ruling. This calls for more than mere \ndisagreement with the ruling of the bankruptcy court. To satisfy this standard, \"the \ndifference of opinion must arise out of genuine doubt as to the correct legal \nstandard.\" Hulmes v. Honda Motor Co., 936 F. Supp. 195,208 (D.N.J. 1996), aff'd, \n141 F.3d 1154 (3d Cir. 1998). This prong is also satisfied if \"the bankruptcy court's \n9 decision is contrary to well-established law.\" In re Marvel Entm 't Group, Inc., 209 \nB.R. 832, 837-38 (D. Del. 1997). \n17. To meet the second prong, B&T argues that the Order is contrary to \nwell-established Third Circuit law in Ayres v. Jacobs & Crumplar, P.A., 99 F .3d 565 \n(3d Cir. 1996). In Ayers, a plaintiff filed a complaint against a Delaware law firm in \nthis Court. Ayres, 99 F.3d at 566-67. However, the plaintiff failed to request or \nobtain a signed summons with a seal of the court. Id. at 567. The plaintiff then \nserved the Delaware law firm with a copy of the complaint and an unsigned \nsummons. Id. After several months, the Delaware law firm filed a motion to dismiss \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). Id. This Court granted the motion to dismiss, finding \nthat there was no justification for permitting an amendment to the unsigned summons \nor for extending the deadline for service under Rule 4(m). Id. The plaintiff appealed. \nOn appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal, but distinguished the basis for \ndismissal. \"The failure of a plaintiff to obtain valid process from the court to provide \nit with personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a civil case is fatal to the plaintiffs \ncase. The parties cannot waive a void summons.\" Ayres, 99 F.3d at 569. The Court \nwent on to state: \nA summons which is not signed and sealed by the Clerk of the Court does not \nconfer personal jurisdiction over the defendant. . . Upon proper motion, or if \nthe defendant raises the matter in the responsive pleading, such suit should be \ndismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2). Thus, under such circumstances, it \nbecomes unnecessary for the district courts to consider such questions as \nwhether service was properly made, or whether an extension to the 120-day \nservice period should be granted under Rule 4(m). Nor is it necessary for the \n10 district court to characterize such improper issuance as showing a flagrant \ndisregard for the rules. That sort of analysis is useful in determining under Rule \n4(m) whether plaintiffs had good cause for their failure to make service within \n120 days, but serves no purpose here. \nId. (internal citations omitted). \n18. The Trustee disagrees that Ayers presents any ground for disagreement \nwith the Order here because, the Trustee argues, the Bankruptcy Court was well \nwithin the scope of its broad discretion under Rule 4(m) to extend the time for service \n(See D.I. 2 at 11-12). Rule 4(m) provides: \"If a defendant is not served within 90 \ndays after the complaint is filed, the court--on motion or on its own after notice to the \nplaintiff--must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order \nthat service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause \nfor the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). As the Third Circuit has noted, \"[u]pon determining that \nprocess has not been properly served on a defendant, district courts possess broad \ndiscretion to either dismiss the plaintiffs complaint for failure to effect service or to \nsimply quash service of process.\" Umbenhauer v. Woog, 969 F.2d 25, 30 (3d Cir. \n1992). \"However, dismissal of a complaint is inappropriate when there exists a \nreasonable prospect that service may yet be obtained. In such instances, the district \ncourt should, at most, quash service, leaving the plaintiffs free to effect proper \nservice.\" Id. (citing Richardson v. Ingram Corp., 374 F.2d 502,503 (3d Cir. 1967), \ncert. denied, 389 U.S. 866 (1967). The Trustee cites a number of cases all for the \n11 proposition that Rule 4( m) affords discretion to a court to extend a service deadline. \n(See D.I. 2 at 11-12). \n19. But Ayers held that where a plaintiff fails to timely obtain a signed and \nsealed summons, an inquiry under Rule 4(m) serves no purpose. Ayres, 99 F.3d at \n569. The cases cited by the Trustee do not contradict Ayres; rather, in each of the \nTrustee's cited cases, the plaintiff timely obtained a signed and sealed summons. See \nUmbenhauer, 969 F.2d at 28 (plaintiff obtained a summons); Novak v. World Bank, \n703 F.2d 1305, 1308 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same); West v. Coupe, 2018 WL 5004860, \nat *1 (D. Del. Oct. 16, 2018) (same); Copia Communs., LLC v. AMR.esorts, L.P., \n2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94486 (E.D. Pa. June 20, 2017) (same); Aviation Exch. Corp. \nv. Nightclub Mgmt. & Dev., 2009 WL 605397, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 10, 2009) (same). \nIndeed, each of these cases focuses on service, and not on the lack of personal \njurisdiction. These cases support an argument that if a summons is obtained and \nservice is attempted but is unsuccessful, a court has discretion to extend the time for \nservice. That is not the case here, where the Trustee failed to take a necessary step to \ninvoke the Court's jurisdiction. \n20. The Trustee asserts that B&T's arguments with respect to a lack of \npersonal jurisdiction are a \"distraction\" because B&T is \"unquestionably subject to \npersonal jurisdiction in the District of Delaware\" where it maintains offices and \nconducts regular business. (D.I. 2 at 2, 8). But the defendant in Ayres was also a law \nfirm with offices in Delaware-just like B&T-and yet this fact did not create \n12 personal jurisdiction. The Ayres court held that an unsigned and unsealed summons \n\"fails to confer personal jurisdiction over a defendant even if properly served.\" \nAyres, 99 F.3d at 570. So the failure to obtain and serve a summons, and acquire \npersonal jurisdiction over B&T, is not a \"distraction\" but central to Ayres. \n21. In this case, just as in Ayres: the plaintiff failed to obtain a summons; \nthe defendant was a law firm with an office in Delaware; the plaintiff served a copy \nof the underlying Complaint on the defendant without a signed and sealed summons; \nthe defendant did not waive service of the summons; and the defendant filed a motion \nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2). Yet the Court in Ayers dismissed the Complaint at \nissue without consideration of an extension of time under Rule 4(m) concluding that \nthe \"good cause\" analysis urged by the Trustee \"serves no purpose here.\" Ayres, 99 \nF.3d at 569. The Order thus appears contrary to well-established law in Ayers. \n22. The Jurisdictional Issue arises not from a mere disagreement with the \nBankruptcy Court's decision but rather a genuine doubt as to whether the court \napplied the correct legal standard. The second prong of the \u00a7 1292(b) analysis is also \nsatisfied. \n23. Finally, with respect to the third factor for interlocutory appeal under \u00a7 \n1292(b ), \"courts place particular weight on whether immediate appeal will materially \nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" In re Paragon Offshore PLC, \n2020 WL 1815550, at *3 (D. Del. Apr. 9, 2020) (citation and internal quotations \nmarks omitted). An interlocutory appeal \"materially advances\" the litigation if it \n13 would \"(1) eliminate[] the need for trial, (2) eliminate[] complex issues so as to \nsimplify the trial, or (3) eliminate[] issues to make discovery easier and less costly.\" \nId. ( citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, immediate appeal of the \nJurisdictional Ruling may eliminate the need for trial altogether. Moreover, \nexceptional circumstances are present. The Order provided no explanation as to why \nit diverged from Ayres. For the parties to continue litigating this matter, significant \nfees, costs, and expenses will be incurred. Moreover, this exact same issue-the \napplicability of Ayres-is likely to be raised at the conclusion of such litigation. \nFarcing the parties to proceed with litigation when there appears to be controlling law \nthat definitively resolves the matter is an exceptional circumstance warranting leave \nto appeal. \n24. Based on the foregoing, I conclude that the Jurisdictional Ruling is \nappropriate for interlocutory review. \n25. With respect to the second ruling B&T seeks leave to appeal-whether \n\"the Bankruptcy Court commit[ted] legal error in determining that B&T was not \nreleased in accordance with the express language of the Interim DIP Order and/or the \nFinal DIP Order\" (D.I. 1 at 8), which B&T refers to as the Release Ruling-I \nconclude that this ruling is inappropriate interlocutory review. \n26. According to the Trustee, \"B&T' s position concerning the application of \nthe underlying plan releases to the Trustee's claims in this case involves disputed \nissues of fact that are not appropriate for an interlocutory appeal (namely, and among \n14 other possible factual issues, B&T claims to have been released in its capacity as \ncounsel to a \"Prepetition Lender,\" while the Trustee maintains that B&T received \navoidable transfers directly from the Debtor in B&T' s capacity as counsel to the \nDebtor). (D.I. 2 at 8-9). A proper interlocutory appeal \"must concern a controlling \nquestion of law. A pure question of law is something the court of appeals could \ndecide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record.\" Gilmore v. Jones, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157329, at *9 (W.D. Va. Sep. 16, 2019). B&T disagrees that \nan appeal would involve any disputed issues of fact, citing cases in support of its \ncontention that \"interpretations of release provisions and court orders is a question of \nlaw.\" (D.1. 3 at 5-6). \n2 7. As the Trustee correctly argues, the Release Ruling fails to satisfy the \ncriteria of\u00a7 1292(b ). There is no pure question of law involved. The Bankruptcy \nCourt denied the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice and did not even address the \nrelease issue, possibly recognizing that it involved disputed questions of fact and that \nnothing would prevent B&T from seeking dismissal of the case on the basis of the \nreleases once the factual record was further developed. I agree with the Trustee that, \nas such, there is no Release Ruling, and an interlocutory appeal of that aspect of the \nOrder is not appropriate at this time. \n**** \nNOW, THEREFORE, it is HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for Leave \n15 (D.I. 1) is GRANTED in part, solely with respect to the Jurisdictional Ruling. \nOL '? a f:12 \nD STATES DISTRlC'I G \n16 "}
