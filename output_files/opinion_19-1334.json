GALLAGHER & CO. , et al.,  ) \n       ) \nDefendant s.   ) \n  \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n \n1. The Court, having reviewed Defendants\u2019 \u201cMotion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs\u2019 \nOctober 25, 2022 Expert Reports of Philip J. O\u2019Keefe (Infringement) and Philip Green \n(Damages)\u201d (the \u201cMotion\u201d), (D.I. 493), and the parties\u2019 letter briefs relating thereto, (D .I. 494; \nD.I. 499; D.I. 500), and having heard telephonic argument on December 5, 2022, hereby DENIES the Motion for the reasons set out below.  \n2. The first set of opinions at issue relate to Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s theory that \u201cMerSorb \ncontains bromine ions (Br- )\u201d that in turn constitute the \u201cbromine containing promoter\u201d limitation \nat issue in the '147 patent.  (D.I. 494, ex. A at 132 at \u00b6 124, 159, 161)  The Court is not persuaded that Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s theory is an entirely new and different theory from that earlier set out in Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Defendants\u2019 Second Set of Common Interrogatories (\u201cResponse\u201d) , No. \n12 (\u201cROG 12\u201d), as the Court understands that submission.  (D.I. 494, ex. C at 4; see also  D.I. \n499 at 1- 2)  To be sure, Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to ROG 12 does not expressly state that \u201cMerSorb \ncontains bromine ions (Br-) which are a bromine containing promoter\u201d; it might have been preferable had the Response been that precise on this point.  But the Response does appear to be attempting to communicate  essentially the same thing, such as when it explains that \u201cMer-Sorb is 2 \n a bromine containing promoter [and] [a]s it passes through the combustion chamber, Mer -Sorb \ntransitions to a gaseous, vapor, or non- aqueous liquid form\u201d that, in this form, \u201creacts with \nactivated c arbon to form a promoted brominated sorbent.\u201d   (D.I. 494, ex. C at 4; see also  D.I. \n499 at 1 (describing the chemical operation of MerSorb))   What was conveyed here was \nsufficient to put Defendants on notice of Plaintiffs\u2019 position, and to allow Defendants  to inquire \nfurther about that position during fact discovery, had they wished to do so.   Now, in expert \ndiscovery, Mr. O\u2019Keefe is further articulating this theory.  See TQ Delta, LLC v. ADTRAN, Inc., \nCivil Action No. 14- 954-RGA, 2021 WL 3633637, at *2 (D. Del. Aug. 17, 2021) (noting that an \nexpert is entitled to expand upon a previously- disclosed infringement theory).  Therefore, the \nCourt cannot find that Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s theory regarding the bromine containing promoter is untimely.  \n3. The second set of opinions at issue  are Mr. Green\u2019s opinions regarding the ADA -\nES license.   (D.I. 494, ex. B at \u00b6\u00b6 174- 79)  The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs \nfailed to timely disclose the publicly -available ADA -ES license (one that Plaintiffs and their \nexpert seemingly could have  earlier  located at any time during the fact discovery period) as a \ncomparable license.   (D.I. 494 at 1; D.I. 500 at 1- 2)  However, the Pennypack factors do not \nweigh in favor of striking Mr. Green\u2019s opinions regarding this license.  At th e outset, the Court \nhas to be mindful of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \u2019s guidance that \n\u201c[e]xclusion of critical evidence is an extreme sanction, not normally to be imposed absent a \nshowing of willful deception or flagrant disrega rd of a court order by the proponent of the \nevidence. \u201d  In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 791- 92 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  The first Pennypack  factor, which considers surprise or \nprejudice, weighs in favor of Defendants.  Surely Defendants would have been surprised to see 3 \n discussion of this license in Mr. Green\u2019s report, since they had earlier asked Plaintiffs in \ndiscovery to identify any comparable licenses, and Plaintiffs had not disclosed this  license in \nresponse.  (D.I. 494 at 1)  The second and third Pennypack  factors weigh against striking Mr. \nGreen\u2019s opinion, as any discovery that Defendants need regarding this issue should be fairly focused and \u201ctailored[,]\u201d and Defendants should be able to accompl ish such discovery without \nunduly disrupting the pre -trial schedule or threatening the new November 13, 2023 trial \ndate.   (Id. at 3 (Defendants noting that they would have \u201csought tailored discovery from ADA -\nES and Clean Coal Solutions\u201d had the ADA -ES license been timely disclosed))  The fourth \nPennypack factor also favors Plaintiffs, as there is no indication that their failure to earlier identify the ADA -ES license was the product of bad faith; rather, Plaintiffs assert that they only \nfirst thought to search for an ADA -ES-related license when ADA -ES was mentioned in \nDefendants\u2019 September 29, 2022 interrogatory responses.  (D.I. 4 99 at 2)   Finally, the last \nPennypack factor is about neutral.  While Mr. Green\u2019s reliance on the license (which he \ndescribes in some detail in his expert report) indicates that the license is somewhat important  to \nPlaintiffs\u2019 damages case, it is \u201cjust one  of several agreements considered by Mr. Green[,]\u201d ( id. at \n3), and thus Plaintiffs have other probative evidence on this front.  With the Pennypack factors leaning slightly in favor of Plaintiffs here, the Court will not strike Mr. Green\u2019s opinions regardi ng the ADA -ES license.   However, Defendants may take targeted discovery relating to \nthat license.   The Court expects that the parties will work together cooperatively to attempt to \nagree on the scope and timing of such discovery and to complete that  discovery in a timely \nfashion. \n4. The third and final remaining set of opinions at issue  are Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s opinions \nregarding pre -suit knowledge and intent.  Certain facts included in these op inions  do appear to 4 \n have been previously disclosed.  ( Compare D.I. 494, ex. A at 101 at \u00b6  132, with D.I. 499, ex. F at \n28)  However, the Court agrees with Defendants that at least certain as pects of these opinions a re \nuntimely, in that some of the content that Mr. O \u2019Keefe discusses th erein does  not appea r to have \nbeen previously disclosed, either in the Fourth Amended Complaint or elsewhere.  Certain of this \nmaterial should have been long known to Plaintiffs, such as the identity of certain articles and reports published by the inventors of the patents -in-suit.  (See, e.g., D.I. 494, ex. A at 92 at \u00b6  \n118)  In other cases, Plaintiffs asserted (and Defendants did not strongly contest) that Plaintiffs \ncould not  have disclosed particular facts much earlier, since Plaintiffs only learned of their \nexistence shor tly before Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s report was due  (in that the facts were found in e -mails \nproduced by Defendants a few weeks before or after the close of fact discovery ).  (D.I. 499 at 4 \n(citing D.I. 494, ex. A at \u00b6\u00b6 121- 22); see also  D.I. 500 at 2)   In the end though, ev en if the Court \nwere to apply the Pennypack factors to the late -disclosed facts /opinions at issue here, striking the \nmaterial would not be the right result.   The first Pennypack factor is mixed, since while \nDefendants may have been surprised to see facts in Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s report that were not previously set out in discovery responses, some number of those facts were derived from Defendants\u2019 own documents and e -mails.   (See D.I. 499 at 4)   The second  and third Pennypack \nfactors go Plaintiffs\u2019 way, as there would be time to cure any prejudice to Defendants without disrupting the November 2023 trial.  Defendants have not identified an outsized amount of discovery that is needed regarding these issues.  (D.I. 494 at 3)   With respect to the fourth \nPennypack factor, it too favors Plaintiffs, as there is no strong indication that Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to timely disclose these facts was the product of bad faith or willful disregard of the rules.  And the fifth Pennypack  factor also favors Plaintiffs, since the opinions at issue are clearly important , \ninter alia , to Plaintiffs\u2019 indirect infringement claims.   (D.I. 499 at 5)   Accordingly, when it 5 \n comes to these opinions about pre -suit knowledge and intent, nearly all of the Pennypack factors \nmilitate against the \u201c extreme sanction \u201d called for by Defendants\u2019 Motion.  That said, under the \ncircumstances, the Court again finds that Defendants should be permitted to take \u201ctailored\u201d \ndiscovery relating to the previously undisclosed facts regarding pre -suit knowledge and \nintent.   (D.I. 494 at 3 (Defendants noting that they could have sought \u201ctailored discovery . . . \nfrom the various non- parties that Mr. O\u2019Keefe claims could have told Defendants about the \nAsserted Patents\u201d if  Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s opinions had been timely disclosed) (emphasis omitted))  As \nwith the supplemental discovery regarding the ADA -ES license, the Court expects that the \nparties will be able to work cooperatively to negotiate the scope and timing of such discove ry, \nand to complete such discovery in due course .   \n5. Therefore, f or the reasons set out above, the Court hereby ORDERS that \nDefendants\u2019  Motion is DENIED.    \n6. Because this Memorandum Order may contain confidential information, it has \nbeen released under  seal, pending review by the parties to allow them to submit a single, jointly \nproposed, redacted version (if necessary) of the Memorandum Order.  Any such redacted version shall be submitted no later than December 12, 2022 for review by the Court .  It should be \naccompanied by  a motion for redaction that shows that the presumption of public access to \njudicial records has been rebutted with respect to the proposed redacted material, by including a factually -detailed explanation as to how that material is the \u201ckind of information that courts will \nprotect and  that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking \nclosure.\u201d  In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d Cir. 2019)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Court will subse quently issue a \npublicly- available version of its Memorandum Order.  6 \n Dated :  December 7, 2022     \n ____________________________________ \n       Christopher J.
