{"case_name": "Oliver v. Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc.", "case_number": "21-1697", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "01-24-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nLINDA OLIVER, )\nPlaintiff,\nv. C.A. No. 21-1697 (GBW)\nSAKURA FINETEK U.S.A., INC.,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington, this out day of January 2023, having considered Defendant\u2019s motion\nto dismiss for failure to prosecute (D.I. 7) and Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I.\n14);\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute\n(D.I. 7) is DENIED.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff shall show cause on or before February\u201c ,\n2023, why Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should not be granted.\n\nPlaintiff, a pro se litigant, commenced this action in state court and it was removed to this\nCourt by Defendant on December 1, 2021. (D.I. 1). In her Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a\npersonal injury claim against Defendant. She alleges that, while using a defective automatic\ncover slipper manufactured by Defendant, the hood of the machine slammed down on her head,\ncausing her to sustain a concussion and continuing medical issues. (D.I. 1-1 at 6-7). On\nFebruary 10, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint. (D.I. 3). The next day a\nscheduling order was entered, setting a discovery cut off date of June 13, 2022, and a dispositive\nmotion deadline of October 13, 2022. (D.I. 4). On April 4, 2022, Plaintiff filed an \u201cAnswer\u201d to\n\nDefendant\u2019s Answer, asserting that she has worked professionally in the healthcare industry as a\nHistotechnologist for nearly thirty years, and that she was working at \u201cthe hospital University of\nPennsylvania\u201d when she sustained her injury. (D.I. 5). She filed sealed medical records as an\nexhibit to her Answer. (DI. 6). On April 8, 2022, the Court notified Plaintiff that her Answer\nand medical records were deficient for failing to comply with D. Del. LR 5.2(b)(2), and directed\nher to file a certificate of service showing how the filings had been served upon Defendant.\n(4/8/2022 Remark). Plaintiff did not then file a certificate of service.\n\nOn June 27, 2022, Defendant, apparently having conducted no discovery, filed a motion\nto dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for failure to prosecute. (D.J. 7). Defendant\u2019s motion to\ndismiss, and exhibits attached thereto, outline how counsel contacted Plaintiff in April 2022, and\nseveral times thereafter, asking for her to provide her sealed medical records, and how she did\nnot provide them until two months later. (D.I. 8 at 6-7). Defendant asserts that the medical\nrecords \u201care incomplete and do not clarify Plaintiffs claims or damages.\u201d (D.I. 8 at 7). Plaintiff\nthen filed a certificate of service stating that she sent her Answer and sealed medical records to\nDefendant on April 15, 2022, and a letter to the Court asserting that she did not know that she\nwas required to file the certificate of service with the Court. (D.I. 9, 9-2). Plaintiff filed a\nresponse to the motion to dismiss only after being ordered to do so by the Court, and asserted\ntherein that she had given Defendant her medical records and that that was \u201call they have asked\nfor.\u201d (D.I. 11). She further asserted, \u201cthe evidence [is] in my medical records and it speak[s] for\nitself, I have taken action[,] I responded to the calls[,] I produced my medical records, without\nhesitation.\u201d (Id.). In its reply, Defendant asserted that Plaintiff had misinformed the Court\nbecause she in fact had not sent her medical records to Defendant until June, and that \u201cit is\nevident that Plaintiff does not believe the Court\u2019s orders, Federal Rules, or Local Rules apply to\n\nher matter.\u201d (D.I. 13 at 6).\nOn October 13, 2022, which was the dispositive-motion deadline, Defendant filed a\nmotion for summary judgment. (D.I. 14). Defendant asserted that the motion was filed \u201c[i]n\norder to preserve its right to move for summary judgment.\u201d (D.I. 15 at 4). Defendant\u2019s\nargument for summary judgment was exactly one paragraph long, and incorporated its request\nfor dismissal for failure to prosecute:\n\nPlaintiff has failed to prove any element of her claims, and therefore Defendant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiff has failed to clearly articulate her\n\nclaims, or put forth any evidence to establish the elements of those claims. Further,\n\nno fact or expert discovery has been conducted. As such, there is a complete failure\n\nof proof with regard to Plaintiff's claims. There is a purported narrative report\n\nincluded in plaintiff's medical records, but these bare observations do not constitute\n\nand expert opinion and is not insufficient to prove her claims. Defendant also\n\nincorporates, by reference, the arguments in its pending Motion to Dismiss for\n\nFailure to Prosecute briefings [D.I. 7, 8, and 13].\n\n(Ud. at 8-9).\n\nAs with Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, Plaintiff did not file a response to the motion for\nsummary judgment until ordered to do so by the Court. (D.I. 16). In her response, she again\nasserted that she had complied with Defendant\u2019s request for her medical records. (D.I. 17). In\nits reply, Defendant asserted, inter alia, that Plaintiff failed to establish that she can prove her\nclaim, and that Plaintiff \u201ccontinues to flout the rules of this Court.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 2). Defendant\nalso reasserted its request to dismiss for failure to prosecute. (/d. at 3).\n\nMotion to Dismiss. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), a court may dismiss an action\n\u201c[flor failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with [the Federal Rules] or any order of\ncourt....\u201d Although dismissal is an extreme sanction that should only be used in limited\ncircumstances, dismissal is appropriate if a party fails to prosecute the action. Harris v. City of\n\nPhiladelphia, 47 F.3d 1311, 1330 (3d Cir. 1995); see also Torres v. Amerada Hess Corp., 240 F.\n\nApp\u2019x 946, 954 (3d Cir. 2007). \u201cIn certain cases, it is a necessary tool to punish parties who fail\nto comply with the discovery process and to deter future abuses.\u201d National Hockey League v.\nMetropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 643 (1976).\n\nThe following six factors determine whether dismissal is warranted. (1) The extent of the\nparty\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet\nscheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct\nof the party was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal,\nwhich entails an analysis of other sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense.\nPoulis v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir. 1984); See also Wallace v.\nGraphics Mgmt. Associates, 197 F. App\u2019x 138 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nThe Court must balance the factors and need not find that all of them weigh against\nPlaintiff to dismiss the action. Emerson v. Thiel Coll., 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002).\nBecause dismissal for failure to prosecute involves a factual inquiry, it can be appropriate even if\nsome of Poulis factors are not satisfied. Hicks v. Feeney, 850 F.2d 152, 156 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\nWith regard to the first factor, as a pro se litigant, Plaintiff is solely responsible for\nprosecuting her claim. Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., 980 F.2d 912, 920 (3d Cir. 1992).\nGiven Plaintiff's pro se status, Defendant would be correct in its assertion that \u201c[t]he failure to\nrespond to discovery requests is directly attributable to her,\u201d (D.I. 8 at 9), if Defendant had\nengaged in the discovery process. However, it does not appear on this record that Defendant has\nmade any discovery requests. As noted, Defendant requested sealed medical records which\nPlaintiff had proactively filed on the record, and Defendant ultimately received them. It is of\ncourse possible that Defendant is referencing other discovery requests that it has omitted from\n\nmentioning in its filings.\nRegarding the second factor, prejudice occurs when a plaintiffs failure to prosecute\nburdens the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare for trial. Ware v. Rodale Press, Inc., 322 F.3d 218,\n222-23 (3d Cir. 2003). Defendant asserts: \u201cAs the record stands, Defendant does not have\nenough information to identify the alleged defective product, identify any specific injuries,\nquantify special damages, or otherwise meaningfully understand, or defend against, her claims.\u201d\n(D.I. 8 at 10). Much of this statement would properly be included in a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which\nDefendant could have filed to challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiff's complaint allegations.\nHowever, Defendant made the strategic decision to waive the filing of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,\nopting to answer the Complaint instead. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (\u201cA motion asserting any of\nthese defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\u201d).\nAdditionally, much of Defendant\u2019s above-quoted assertion would properly be made by a party\nwhose discovery requests have been ignored, and who, despite securing court orders compelling\ncompliance, is still left without the necessary information due to the opposing party\u2019s\nrecalcitrance. Again, however, it appears that Defendant has not propounded a solitary discovery\nrequest. Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant has been prejudiced by\nPlaintiff's conduct in this case.\n\nAs to the third and fourth factors, the Court disagrees with Defendant\u2019s assertions that \u201cit\nis evident that Plaintiff does not believe the Court\u2019s orders, Federal Rules, or Local Rules apply\nto her matter,\u201d (D.L. 13 at 6), and that Plaintiff \u201ccontinues to flout the rules of this Court.\u201d (D.I.\n18 at 2). Plaintiff is indeed responsible for complying with Court orders, Federal Rules and\nLocal Rules, and is reminded of the same here, but by all indications she has interacted\n\nrespectfully with the Court and counsel, and the simple procedural mistakes of a pro se litigant\nare a far cry from \u201cflouting\u201d rules or acting as if they do no not apply her. As such, the Court\nconcludes that Plaintiff's conduct was neither willful nor in bad faith and will not at this time\ncharacterize her conduct as a history of dilatoriness.\n\nThe Court concludes that the other two factors are, at most, neutral. For these reasons,\nthe motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute is denied.\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment. A court must grant summary judgment \u201cif the movant\nshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of\ndemonstrating the absence of any genuine issues of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the non-moving party,\nthen the moving party may satisfy its burden of production by pointing to an absence of evidence\nsupporting the non-moving party\u2019s case, after which the burden of production shifts to the non-\nmovant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co.,\nLtd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams v. West Chester, 891 F.2d\n458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989). Material facts are those \u201cthat could affect the outcome\u201d of the\nproceeding. Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011).\n\nOn this record, Defendant has established the absence of any genuine issue of fact. This\nis so because the only evidence currently in the record are Plaintiff's medical records, which, in\nand of themselves, do not create a genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, summary\njudgment will be granted for Defendant if Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact by \u201cciting to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions,\ndocuments, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, . . .\n\nadmissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). Plaintiff's\nfactual assertions, \u201cif supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, must be regarded as\ntrue....\u201d Aman y. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, 1080 (3d Cir. 1996). If \u201cthere is\nany evidence in the record from any source from which a reasonable inference in [Plaintiff's]\nfavor may be drawn, [Defendant] simply cannot obtain a summary judgment.\u201d Id. at 1081\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff has until the date set above to make and support\n\nsuch factual assertions, by affidavit or other acceptable evidence.\n\nHn,\n\nThe Honorable Gregory B. Williams\nUnited States District Judge\n"}
