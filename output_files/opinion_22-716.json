(D.I. 9, 10, 12).  Plaintiff , Dennis Dizon \n(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), who is proceeding pro se, opposes the motion .  (D.I. 11) .  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, the motion is granted . \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff began working for JPMorgan as a contractor/consultant in October 2017 (D.I. 1 \nat 4) and was subsequently hired by JPMorgan directly in February of 2019 (D.I. 10- 1).  \nDefendant\u2019s employment offer letter to Plaintiff dated January 18, 2019 (\u201cthe Offer Letter\u201d) \ncontains a section titled \u201cBinding Arbitration Agreement\u201d (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d).   (D.I. 10, Exhibit \nB).  The Agreement establishes a mandatory arbitration process for claims made by employees arising out of their employment or termination of employment with JPMorgan.  (D.I. 10 -2 at 6 -\n11).  Specifically, the Agreement states:  \n\u201cAs a condition of and in consideration of [Plaintiff\u2019s] employment \nwith JPMorgan Chase & Co. or any of its direct or indirect \nsubsidiaries,\u201d any and all \u201cCovered Claims\u201d between Plaintiff and \nJPMorgan Chase \u201cshall be submitted to and resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with [the] Agreement.\u201d  \n \n(D.I. 10- 2 at 7).  \n The Agreement defines \u201cCovered Claims\u201d as encompassing:  \nall legally protected employment -related claims, . . . that I now have \nor in the future may have against JPMorgan Chase or its  officers, \ndirectors, shareholders, employees or agents which arise out of or relate to my employment or separation from employment with JPMorgan Chase and all legally protected employment -related \n \n1  In Defendant\u2019s opening brief filed on June 30, 2022, it states that it was improperly named in the Complaint as J.P. Morgan Chase and the proper Defendant should be JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  (D.I. 5). 2 claims that JPMorgan Chase has or in the future may have ag ainst \nme, including, but not limited to, claims of employment \ndiscrimination or harassment if protected by applicable federal, state or local law, and retaliation for raising discrimination or harassment claims, failure to pay wages, bonuses or other compe nsation, \ntortious acts, wrongful, retaliatory and/or constructive discharge, \nbreach of an express or implied contract, promissory estoppel, \nunjust enrichment, and violations of any other common law, federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, regulation o r public policy, \nincluding, but not limited to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act, and the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. \n \n(Id.).  The Agreement provides that arbitration \u201cwill occur in the state where [employee is] \ncurrently or was most recently employed . . . unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.\u201d  ( Id. at 9).  \nPlaintiff electronically accepted the Offer on January 18, 2019 at 4:14 a.m.  ( Id. at 12 ).  \nJPMorgan terminated Plaintiff\u2019s employment on or about November 8, 2020.  (D.I. 1 at 5).  \nPlaintiff commenced this action on June 1, 2022, by filing a Complaint for Employment \nDiscrimination  based on his race, color, and national origin.  (D.I. 1).  H e alleges that he \u201cwas \nsubjected to unlawful retaliation based on complaints of discrimination against several members of leadership\u201d and that he \u201cwas also excluded from opportunities to advance his career.\u201d  ( Id.).  \nPlaintiff  demands $1,000,000 in monetary damages, that the Court appoint him legal counsel, and \nsuch other relief as may be appropriate, including costs and attorney\u2019s fee.  ( Id.).\n2   \n \n2  Attached to the Complaint are Plaintiff\u2019s Charge of Discrimination  dated \nFebruary  12, 2021 filed with the Delaware Department of Labor and his Determination and \nNotice of Rights from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission dated \nMarch  7, 2022.  Plaintiff states that he received the Notice -of-Right -to-Sue letter on the \nsame day, March 7, 2022. 3 On July 22, 2022, Defendant moved to compel arbitration of Plaintiff\u2019s claims and to stay \nall proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration alleging that the parties entered into a valid, \nbinding arbitration agreement.  (D.I. 9 ).  Defendant alleges that pursuant to the binding arbitration \nagreement, all \u201cemployment -related claims , and specifically those alleging violations of Title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, be resolved through arbitration before the American Arbitration Association.\u201d  (D.I. 10 at 1).  Plaintiff opposes Defendant\u2019s motion, asserting that the Agreement \u201cshould be considered null and void because it was formulated in bad faith and was designed to: \na) Preemptively strip away the plaintiff \u2019s civil rights; b) Extort the plaintiff into submission by \naccepting an unreasonable agreement; c) Inflict economic dures s to force the plaintiff to succumb \nto undue influence.\u201d  (D.I. 11 at 1).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nWith the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), \u201cCongress has instructed federal courts to \nenforce arbitration agreements according to their terms \u2013 including terms provided for \nindividualized proceedings.\u201d  Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis , - U.S.--, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1621 (2018)).  \nThis ensures that arbitration agreements \u201care enforceable to the same extent as other contracts.\u201d  Puleo v. Chase Bank USA, NA., 605 F .3d 172, 178 (3d Cir. 2010). \nWhen presented with an arbitration provision, this Court\u2019s task is to determine whether \u201ca \nvalid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and [whether] the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that agreement.\u201d  John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Glick , \n151 F.3d 132, 137 (3d Cir. 1998).  When conducting this analysis, courts in the Third Circuit apply the standard for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).   In re Remicade (Direct Purchaser) \nAntitrust Litig. , 938 F.3d 515, 519 (3d Cir. 2019) (\u201cRemicade\u201d) (quoting Lamps Plus, Inc. v. \nVarela , 139 S. Ct. 1407, 1415 (2019)).  Although the Third Circuit has held that a district court \nlacks the authority to compel arbitration outside of its district, Econo- Car Int \u2019l, Inc. v. Antilles Car 4 Rentals, Inc., 499 F.2d 1391, 1394 (3d Cir. 1974), district courts may dismiss actions that are \nsubject to arbitration elsewhere.3  See, e.g., Sanum Inv. Ltd. v. San Marco Capital Partners LLC , \n263 F. Supp. 3d 491,496-97 (D. Del. 2017). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Arbitrability of Plaintiff\u2019s Claims  \nIt is not disputed that Plaintiff accepted the Offer, which included the Agreement, or that \nthe Agreement by its terms a pplies to Plaintiff\u2019s discrimination claims .  Plaintiff, however, argues \nthat the Agreement is unreasonable and unconscionable  because he was pressured to sign it to \nobtain employment and he did not have an attorney.  T herefore, he argues that it is  not enforceable.  \n(D.I. 11 at 2- 3).   \nUnder Delaware law, a contract is unconscionable \u201cif one of the parties lacks meaningful \nchoice and the contract terms  unreasonably favor one party over the other.\u201d   Wells v. Merit Life \nIns. Co., 671 F. Supp. 2d 570, 574 (D. Del. 2009).  \u201cCourts have generally recognized that the \ndoctrine of unconscionability requires both procedural and substantive elements.\u201d   Maxwell v. \nCellco P\u2019ship , C.A. No. 19-152- RGA, 2019 WL 5587313, at *7 (D. Del. Oct. 30, 2019) (citation \nomitted).   Moreover, \u201c[s]uperior  bargaining power alone without the element of unreasonableness \ndoes not permit a finding of  unconscionability or unfairness.  The traditional test is this: a contract \nis unconscionable if it is \u2018such as no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and as no  honest or fair man would accept, on the other.\u2019\u201d  Gonzalez v. Citigroup, \nC.A.  No. CIV.09-017-SLR, 2009 WL 2340678, at *2 (D. Del. July 30, 2009). \n \n3  According to the Agreement, \u201carbitration . . . will occur in the state where [employee] . . . \nwas most recently employed by the Firm, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.\u201d   (D.I.  10-\n2 at 9).  In this case, the location of Plaintiff\u2019s most recent employment appears to be \nDelaware.   (See D.I. 1 at 2).  5 Here, Plaintiff  first argues that the Agreement should be  considered \u201cnull and void\u201d \nbecause it was  designed to \u201c[p]reemptively strip away the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights\u201d and that \u201c[a] \n\u2018reasonable\u2019  person would not accept an agreement that jeopardizes or \u2018waives\u2019 his constitutional \nand civil  rights as provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 unless he was coerced to \ndo so.\u201d   (D.I. 11 at 1-2).  The United States Supreme Court , however, has rejected th is argument \nholding \u201cthat \u2018by agreeing  to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substa ntive \nrights afforded by the statute;  it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, \nforum.\u2019\u201d  Gilmer v.  Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 26 (1991) (quoting Mitsubishi \nMotors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler -Plymouth, Inc., 4 73 U.S. 614, 628 (1985)).  Additionally, courts \nin the Third Circuit  have held that the FAA permits arbitration of Title VII claims.  See Esaka v. \nNanticoke Health Servs. , Inc. 752 F. Supp. 2d 476, 483 (D. Del. 2010) (dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s \nTitle VII and Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act claims and compelling arbitration, \nfinding that, inter alia , \u201cThird Circuit case law is . . . clear that Title VII discrimination claims do \nnot require a judicial  forum and that agreements to arbitrate such  claims are enforceable under the \nFAA .\u201d) (internal  citations omitted); Gonzalez v. Citigroup, C.A. No. 09- 17-SLR, 2009 WL \n2340678, at *2 (D. Del. July 30, 2009) (granting the defendant employer\u2019s motion to dismiss based \non an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff, noting that, \u201c[c]ontrary to plaintiff\u2019s argument, \nby acquiescing to the arbitration agreements, plaintiff did not \u2018forego the substantive rights \nafforded by [Title  VII]; rather [he] only submit[ted] to their resolution in an arbitral, rath er than a \njudicial forum\u2019\u201d).  \nSecond, Plaintiff argues that the Agreement is unenforceable because not signing the  \nAgreement would have caused him \u201ceconomic duress\u201d because \u201cdeclining the agreement would \ntranslate to unemployment.\u201d  (D.I. 11 at 2).  This, however, does not support a finding of 6 unconscionability.  Indeed, courts regularly enforce arbitration  agreements that are a condition of \nemployment.  See Vilches v. The Travelers Cos. , 413 Fed. App\u2019x. 487, 494 (3d Cir. 2011) (\u201cVilches \nonly demonstrated their position relative to Travelers and their  interest in maintaining \nemployment, which is insufficient on its own to prove that the class  arbitration waiver is \nunreasonably favorable to Travelers.  As such, we conclude that the waiver  is not substantively \noppressive and unconscionable.\u201d); Gonzalez , 2009 WL 2340678, at *2 (\u201cThe  possibility that \ndefendant allegedly tempted plaintiff with a spot on the payroll to goad him into signing the \narbitration agreements does not, standing alone, prove unconscionability.\u201d); Mayhan v. Sunoco, \nInc., C.A. No. 18- 355-RGA, 2020 WL 247517, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. 16, 2020) (citing cases); Marotta \nv. Toll Bros., C.A. No. 09- 2328, 2010 WL 744174, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 3, 2010)  (\u201cA plaintiff\u2019s \nfear of the loss of her job is insufficient to amount to economic duress when \u2018the  situation that \ncaused [her] to fear the loss of [her] job \u2013 the need to support [her family] \u2013 was of  [her] own \nmaking,\u2019 and not t hat of the defendant.\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThird, Plaintiff argues that the Agreement is \u201cbased on \u2018bad faith\u2019 in the form of \u201cundue  \ninfluence\u201d because he was \u201cpressur[ed]\u201d to \u201csuccumb even when the conditions are in violation of \nhis civil rights\u201d and the  Agreement violates public policy because he did not have legal  \nrepresentation when signing the Agreement.  As Defendant points out (D.I 12 at 5), however, \n\u201c[t]he FAA manifests \u2018a congressional declaration of a liberal  federal policy favoring arbitration \nagreements . . . .\u2019\u201d  Quilloin v. Tenet HealthSystem Phila., Inc., 673 F.3d 221, 228 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(quoting Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983)).   \u201cThe fact \nthat courts routinely find compulsory arbitration clauses enfo rceable in employment contexts \ndemonstrates that such agreements are not contrary to public policy.\u201d  Marotta, 2010 WL 744174, \nat *6 (citing cases).  Here, Plaintiff does  not point to any specific violation of public policy to 7 support his claim and his con clusory assertion of  a violation of public policy cannot suffice to \nsupport his argument in light of the clear case law to the contrary.  \nMoreover, with respect to Plaintiff\u2019s assertion of \u201cundue influence\u201d and lack of legal  \nrepresentation, it is well- settled law in the Third Circuit that \u201c[u]nequal bargaining power,  without \nmore, is insufficient to hold an arbitration agreement unconscionable.\u201d  Wells v. Merit  Life Ins. \nCo., 671 F. Supp. 2d 570, 574 (D. Del. 2009); see also Tulowitzki v. Atlantic Richfield  Co., \n396 A.2d 956, 960 (D. Del. 1978) (\u201cSuperior bargaining power alone without the element of  \nunreasonableness does not permit a finding of unconscionability or unfairnes s.  The traditional  test \nis this: a contract is unconscionable if it is \u2018such as no man in his senses and not under  delusion \nwould make on the one hand, and as no honest or fair man would accept, on the  other.\u2019\u201d).  Because \nfederal law recognizes a strong p ublic policy in favor of arbitration, \u201c\u2018[n]othing short of a showing \nof fraud, duress, mistake\u2019 or some other compelling ground to invalidate a contract\u201d \u201cwill permit \na court to preclude enforceability of an agreement to  arbitrate.\u201d  Esaka , 752 F. Supp. 2d at 481 \n(citations omitted).4 \nFinally, Plaintiff suggests in his response (D.I. 1 1 \u00b63) that Defendant colluded with his \nsubsequent employer to terminate his employment in further retaliation for his alleged complaints \nof discrimination and harassment.  These arguments, however, were not asserted in the Complaint  \nand are not part of this case .5   \n \n4  Plaintiff argues that Defendant did not reference the Agreement in its Position Statement \nthat was filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).  That, however, is not relevant because the Agreement expressly \u201c does not preclude [Plaintif f] \nfrom filing an administrative claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).\u201d   (D.I. 10- 2 at 8). \n \n5  The Court notes that  Plaintiff suggests that these claims were not raised in his Charge of \nDiscrimination filed with the EEO C, and therefore, it may be that Plaintiff has not 8 In sum, the Court finds that  the Agreement constitutes a  valid agreement between the \nparties to arbitrate and that Plaintiff\u2019s claims fall within the substantive scope of that Agreement.  \nTherefore, arbitration of Plaintiff\u2019s claims is appropriate.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendant\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and for a stay of \nproceedings during the pendency of the arbitration is granted.  An appropriate order will follow. \n \nexhausted his administrative remedies with respect to these claims, which would mean that \nthis Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain them.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nDENNIS DIZON,  \n \n   Plaintiff,  \n  v.
