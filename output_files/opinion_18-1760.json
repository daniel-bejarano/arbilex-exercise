Civil Action No. 18-1760-CFC \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nJeffrey Kent. Pro Se Petitioner. \nBrian L. Arban, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington, \nDelaware. Counsel for Respondents. \nMarch 29, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware Pending before the Court is an Amended Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 filed by Petitioner Jeffrey Kent. (0.1. 15) The State filed \nan Answer in opposition , to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (0.1. 19; 0.1. 26) For the \nreasons discussed , the Court will deny the Amended Petition. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn June 30, 2011, Dewey Lee was stopped at the intersection \nof West 8th and Monroe Streets in Wilmington , Delaware . \nWhile he was stopped, a man on a bicycle approached his \nvehicle and began speaking with him. At some point during \nthe conversation , the man on the bicycle shot Lee. Lee's \nvehicle then accelerated west on 8th Street before striking a \nutility pole. The man on the bicycle fled north on Monroe \nStreet. \nWhen the Wilmington Police responded to the scene, they \nfound Lee behind the wheel of his vehicle. He was \nunresponsive and bleeding from a gunshot wound to his torso. \nHe died as a result. During the investigation , the Wilmington \nPolice located three eyewitnesses : Thurman Boston, Brianna \nBrown (\"Brianna\"), and Dajuan'ya Brown (\"Dajuan'ya \"). All \nthree identified Kent as the man on the bicycle. \nKent v. State, 135 A.3d 79 (Table), 2016 WL 1039125, at *1 (Del. 2016). \nIn February 2013, a New Castle County grand jury indicted Petitioner on charges \nof first degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony \n(\"PFDCF\"). (0.1. 19 at 1) Two attorneys from the Office of the Public Defender (\"OPD\") \nwere appointed to represent him. \nOn September 18, 2014, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of \nboth charges. See Kent, 2016 WL 1039125, at *3. Petitioner filed motions for judgment \nof acquittal and for a new trial, which the Superior Court denied. See id. On December \n19, 2014, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to life imprisonment for first degree murder and to 10 years of incarceration for PFDCF. See id. Petitioner appealed, and \nthe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed his convictions and sentence in March 2016. \nSee id. \nIn April 2016, Petitioner filed a prose motion for post-conviction relief pursuant \nto Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"). (D.I. 20-10 at 214-15) \nThe Superior Court referred the Rule 61 motion to a Superior Court Commissioner, who \nappointed counsel to represent Petitioner in his Rule 61 proceeding. Post-conviction \ncounsel filed an amended Rule 61 motion in June 2017. (D.I. 20-10 at 218-251) On \nSeptember 5, 2017, the Commissioner issued a report recommending the denial of \nPetitioner's amended Rule 61 motion. (D.I. 20-10 at 298-306); see State v. Kent, 2017 \nWL 3891448, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 5, 2017). The Superior Court adopted the \nReport and Recommendation and denied the Rule 61 motion on December 5, 2017. \n(D.I. 20-10 at 307-308) Petitioner appealed the denial of his Rule 61 motion, and the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision in June 2018. See \nKent v. State, 189 A.3d 1255 (Table), 2018 WL 3156987 (Del. June 26, 2018). \nPetitioner filed his original Petition for federal habeas relief in this Court on \nNovember 6, 2018. (D.I. 5) In May 2019, upon Petitioner's request, the Court stayed \nthe instant proceeding to enable Petitioner to exhaust his ineffective assistance of \ncounsel claims in the Delaware state courts. (D.I. 6; D.I. 7) \nIn June 2019, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a second pro se \nRule 61 motion. (D.I. 20-14 at 31-50) On July 1, 2019, the Superior Court summarily \ndismissed the Rule 61 motion as second or subsequent under Rule 61 (d), and the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision in January 2020. (D.I. 20-14 at 51-53; \n2 D.I. 20-15 at 1-2); see Kent v. State, 225 A.3d 316 (Table), 2020 WL 411333, at *1 (Del. \nJan. 24, 2020). \nThe Court lifted the stay in this proceeding on July 31, 2020. (D.I. 14) Petitioner \nfiled an Amended Petition. (D.I. 15) The State filed an Answer, to which Petitioner filed \na Reply. ( D.I. 19; D.I. 26) \nII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES \nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\"AEDPA\") \"to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences .. \n. and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\" Woodford v. Garceau, \n538 U.S. 202,206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider a habeas \npetition filed by a state prisoner only \"on the ground that he is in cystody in violation of \nthe Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). \nAdditionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for analyzing the \nmerits of a habeas petition in order to \"prevent federal habeas 'retrials' and to ensure \nthat state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\" Bell v. \nCone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002). \nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default \nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief \nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O'Sullivan v. Boercke/, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. \nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \n3 person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court \nshall not be granted unless it appears that-\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the \ncourts of the State; or \n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective \nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process \nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1 ). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity, \ngives \"state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking \none complete round of the State's established appellate review process.\" O'Sullivan, \n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). \nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the \nhabeas claims were \"fairly presented\" to the state's highest court, either on direct \nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court \nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447,451 n.3 (2005); \nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct \nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does \nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See \nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997). \nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further \nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal \ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \"meet\u008f the \ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\" because state remedies are no longer available); \nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are \n4 procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, \n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state's \nhighest court, but that court \"clearly and expressly\" refuses to review the merits of the \nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted \nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. \n255, 260-64 (1989). \nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims \nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual \nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if \nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255,260 \n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural \ndefault, a petitioner must show that \"some objective factor external to the defense \nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\" Murray v. Carrier, \n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that \nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that \nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial \nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\" Id. at 494. \nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \"constitutional violation has \nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, \"1 then a federal court \ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a \nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446,451 \n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F .3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001 ). The miscarriage of justice \n1Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. \n5 exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual \ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 \n(1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting \n\"new reliable evidence-whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy \neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence-that was not presented at trial,\" \nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a \nreasonable doubt. See Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004). \nC. Standard of Review \nIf a state's highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the \nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to\u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if \nthe state court's decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, \nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates,\" or the state court's decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts \nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams \nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,412 (2000); Appel v. Hom, 250 F.3d 203,210 (3d Cir. 2001). A \nclaim has been \"adjudicated on the merits\" for the purposes of\u00a7 2254(d) if the state \ncourt decision finally resolved the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a \nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Hom, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. \n2009). The deferential standard of\u00a7 2254(d) applies even \"when a state court's order is \nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\" \nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011 ). As explained by the Supreme Court, \"it \nmay be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the \n6 absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\" Id. at 99. \nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the \nstate court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See\u00a7 2254(e)(1). This \npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is \nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See\u00a7 2254(e)(1); \nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280, 286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. \n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies \nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of\u00a7 2254( d)(2) \napplies to factual decisions). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nPetitioner asserts six Claims in his timely-filed Amended Petition: (1) the State \nviolated his due process right to a fair trial by not timely disclosing exculpatory evidence \nas required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); (2) the Superior Court erred by \nnot granting Petitioner's motion for a new trial based on instances of prosecutorial \nmisconduct that occurred during closing arguments; (3) the Delaware state courts erred \nin not finding that trial counsel represented Petitioner while operating under an \ninsurmountable conflict of interest; (4) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nnot providing additional information to the Superior Court about the OPD's conflict of \ninterest in a timely manner; (5) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not \ncalling Shaleece Queen to testify as an alibi witness at trial; and (6) cumulative error. \nA. Claim One: Brady v. Maryland Violation \nIn Claim One, Petitioner asserts that the State violated his due process rights \nunder Brady v. Maryland by waiting until the \"eve of trial\" to disclose exculpatory \n7 evidence. More specifically, he contends that the \"State's delay in disclosing the \nstatements of Wallace Archy, Monica Miller, and Raheem Smith denied him the \nopportunity to use the material effectively and cast doubt on the fairness of the entire \nproceeding.\" (0.1. 15 at 6) Petitioner presented the same argument in his pre-trial \n\"motion to dismiss for Brady violation and lack of speedy trial.\" (D.I. 20-3 at 38-53) \nThe Superior Court denied the motion from the bench, concluding that \"there is no \nBrady violation in this case,\" because \"the defense had the information prior to trial and \nmay effectively use it.\" (0.1. 20-9 at 119) Petitioner raised the same Brady argument on \ndirect appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's \nconclusion after determining that there was no Brady violation. See Kent, 2016 WL \n1039125, at *3. Given this adjudication, Petitioner's instant Brady Claim will only \nwarrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was contrary to, or an \nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. \nThe prosecution's failure to disclose evidence violates a defendant's due process \nrights under Brady v. Maryland if: (1) the evidence at issue was favorable to the \naccused, either because it was exculpatory or it had impeachment value; (2) the \nprosecution suppressed the evidence, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) the \nevidence was material. See Stricklerv. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999); Lambert \nv. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 252 (3d Cir. 2004). \"Prosecutors have an affirmative duty to \ndisclose [Brady] evidence ... even though there has been no request [for the evidence] \nby the accused, which may include evidence known only to police.\" Dennis v. Sec'y, \nPa. Dep't of Cons., 834 F.3d 263, 284 (3d Cir. 2016). \"To comply with Brady, \nprosecutors must 'learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the \n8 government's behalf.\"' Id. \nThe following facts provide important background information relevant to the \nCourt's analysis of Petitioner's Brady argument. \nShortly after being appointed, [Petitioner's] counsel sent the \nState a discovery request, which included a request for a list \nof the State's witnesses. The State responded, but did not \nprovide a list of witnesses, citing concerns for the witnesses' \nsafety. This concern may have received some confirmation \nin May 2014 when Wilmington Police came into possession of \na letter from [Petitioner] requesting that his nephew locate the \nwitnesses to the crime. \nOn July 16, 2014, defense counsel again requested a witness \nlist. One reason defense counsel requested the names of the \nwitnesses was to identify potential conflicts of interest. The \nState requested a protective order for the witness list on July \n29, 2014, protecting against disclosure of the names to the \ndefendant. In the weeks that followed, a number of witness \nstatements were provided to [Petitioner's] attorneys. \nJury selection was scheduled to begin on September 8, 2014. \nOn September 2, 2014, the State provided the transcript of \nMonica Miller's statement wherein she stated that she was \nwith Brianna and Dajuan'ya at the time of the incident and that \none could not see the intersection of 8th and Monroe from \ntheir vantage point. \nOn September 6, 2014, the State advised [ ... ] trial counsel \nthat the statements of Wallace Archy, Dexter Briggs, and \nRaheem Smith \u00b7would not be disclosed because the \nstatements contained no Brady material. The next day, the \nState changed its position and provided Archy's and Smith's \nstatements. In his statement, Archy stated that the shooting \noccurred at a different intersection, 8th and Washington. \nSmith told police that he did not see a white person at 8th and \nMonroe (the victim was white), and that it was impossible to \nsee the intersection from where Brianna and Dajuan'ya were \nlocated. \nOn the same day that the Archy and Smith statements were \ndisclosed, [Petitioner] filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that \nthe Miller, Archy, and Smith statements contained Brady \n9 material, which was disclosed in an untimely manner and \nprevented defense counsel from using the evidence \neffectively. The following day, the trial court held a hearing on \nthe motion. The trial court denied [Petitioner's] motion \nbecause [his] trial counsel had been provided the witnesses' \nstatements, and the State was making all three witnesses \navailable to be interviewed by defense counsel. The jury was \nselected on September 8, 2014, and trial commenced on \nSeptember 10, 2014. \nKent, 2016 WL 1039125, at *1-2. \nIn Petitioner's case, the Delaware Supreme Court correctly identified Brady as \nthe applicable law and referred to its analysis in Starling v. State, 882 A.2d 747, 756 \n(Del. 2005) which, in turn, relied on Brady. Therefore, the Delaware Supreme Court's \ndecision is not contrary to clearly established federal law. See Fahy v. Hom, 516 F.3d \n169, 196 (3d Cir.2008) (Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision was not \"contrary to\" \nclearly established federal law because appropriately relied on its own state court \ncases, which articulated the proper standard derived from Supreme Court precedent). \nAdditionally, to the extent there was impeachment or exculpatory material in the \nwitness statements, the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied Brady in \nconcluding that the State's delayed disclosure of those statements and its delayed \npresentation of the witnesses themselves did not violate Petitioner's due process rights. \nA delayed disclosure of Brady material \"that [a] defendant[] could use on cross\u00ad\nexamination to challenge the credibility of Government witnesses\" does not violate the \ndefendant's due process rights if the material was disclosed in time for the defendant to \neffectively use the material at trial. See United States v. Higgs, 713 F.2d 39, 43-4 (3d \nCir. 1983). Due process is satisfied if such material is disclosed the day the witness \ntestifies. Id. \n10 Here, the State provided the witness statements and access to the witnesses two \ndays before trial. During those two days, Petitioner was able to independently assess \nthe statements and the credibility of the witnesses, and ultimately decided to present \ntwo of them -Miller and Archy-as witnesses at trial for the defense. Significantly, \nPetitioner does not allege how or if the timing of the State's disclosure prevented him \nfrom evaluating the relevance and credibility of the witnesses and their statements; nor \ndoes he suggest in any way how trial counsel's questioning of Miller and Archy during \nthe trial would have been different if their statements and identities had been disclosed \nearlier. In other words, Petitioner has failed to satisfy Brady's requirement of prejudice. \nGiven these circumstances, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme \nCourt's determination that trial counsel had an opportunity to use the witness \nstatements effectively did not involve an unreasonable application federal law. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Claim One for failing to satisfy the standard articulated \nin \u00a7 2254(d)(1 ). \nB. Claim Two: Prosecutorial Misconduct \nAt trial, Boston testified for the State that he was behind Lee at \nthe intersection and that [Petitioner] was the shooter. Brianna \nand Dajuan'ya both testified that they saw [Petitioner] from the \nstoop of their home at 814 West 8th Street. Miller testified for \nthe defense that she was with Brianna and Dajuan'ya at the \ntime of the incident, and that one could not see the intersection \nof West 8th and Monroe from the steps of 814 West 8th Street. \nArchy, also called by the defense, testified that he was on \nMonroe Street between 7th and 8th on the evening of the \nincident. He further testified that he did not observe Lee's \nvehicle stopped at the intersection and that he saw it speed \nthrough the intersection. Although [Petitioner's] trial counsel \nwas able to interview Smith, he was not called as a witness. \nDuring closing arguments, [Petitioner's] trial counsel implied \n11 that Boston may have received a benefit for testifying against \nKent. Trial counsel also implied that Boston changed his story \nto comport with Brianna and Dajuan'ya. In response, the State \nargued that the jury could only believe trial counsel's \nsuggestion if the jurors were to violate the rule on speculation \nbecause there was no evidence that Boston received a benefit, \nonly that he was hoping for help with his case. The State also \nargued that there was no evidence presented to support a \nfinding that Boston changed his story to appear more credible. \nThe State also argued that [Petitioner's] trial counsel did not \nread the entire redacted letter that [Petitioner] had written to his \nnephew, a statement which was not correct. After the trial court \nadmonished the State regarding the inaccuracy of its \nstatement, the State informed the jury that it was mistaken and \nthat [Petitioner's] trial counsel had, in fact, read the entire letter. \nShortly after, the State argued that Archy heard a gunshot and \nimmediately saw a vehicle travel through the intersection. After \nit was brought to the State's attention that this was incorrect, \nthe State informed the jury that there was a ten to fifteen second \ndelay between the gunshot and when Archy saw the vehicle \nspeed through the intersection. \nKent, 2016 WL 1039125, at *2-3. After his conviction, Petitioner filed a motion for new \ntrial alleging prosecutorial misconduct. The Superior Court denied that motion. Id. \nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court erred in denying his \nmotion for new trial based on instances of prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during \nclosing arguments. (D.1. 15 at 6-8) Petitioner asserts that the State: (1) impermissibly \nargued that the \"rule against speculation\" prevented the jury from concluding that one of \nits witnesses, Boston, had \"changed his story to appear more credible or that Boston \nmay have received an unknown benefit for his testimony;\" (2) inaccurately claimed that \nPetitioner's trial counsel had not read to the jury Petitioner's letter to his nephew in its \nentirety; and (3) \"misstated Archy's testimony regarding the amount of time between the \ngunshot and observing Lee's vehicle travel through the intersection.\" (D.I. 15 at 6-7) On \n12 direct appeal, Petitioner argued that the Superior Court improperly denied his motion for \nnew trial after rejecting these three arguments alleging prosecutorial misconduct. The \nDelaware Supreme Court denied the argument as meritless. Therefore, Petitioner will \nonly be entitled to habeas relief for Claim Two if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision \nwas either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal \nlaw. \nIn order for a prosecutorial misconduct claim to warrant federal habeas relief, the \nprosecutor's comments must have \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the \nresulting conviction a denial of due process.\" Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 180, \n(1986) (citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637 (1974)). A prosecutorial \nmisconduct claim must be examined in \"light of the record as a whole\" in order to \ndetermine whether the conduct \"had a substantial and injurious effect or influence\" on \nthe jury's verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 638 (1993). In the Third Circuit, \nthis inquiry involves examining \"the prosecutor's offensive actions in context and in light \nof the entire trial, assessing the severity of the conduct, the effect of the curative \ninstructions, and the quantum of evidence against the defendant.\" Moore v. Morton, \n255 F.3d 95 (3d Cir. 2001). \nHere, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not cite federal constitutional \nlaw in its analysis of Petitioner's prosecutorial misconduct arguments, the Court's focus \non whether the State's conduct adversely affected the integrity of the judicial process \nmirrors the inquiry required by Donnelly and its progeny.2 Thus, the Delaware Supreme \n2The State provides an extensive explanation of Delaware's standard for prosecutorial \nmisconduct claims. (0.1. 19 at 17-19) Essentially, the \n13 Court's decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law. \nThe Court must also determine whether the Delaware Supreme Court's rejection \nof Petitioner's prosecutorial misconduct allegations involved an unreasonable \napplication of clearly established federal law. \n1. Boston's differing statements \nDuring closing arguments, trial counsel contended that Boston \"is an \nstandards for reviewing prosecutorial misconduct are slightly different \ndepending on whether the issue was fairly presented below. If defense \ncounsel raised a timely and pertinent objection to prosecutorial misconduct \nat trial, or if the trial judge intervened and considered the issue sua sponte, \n[the Delaware Supreme Court] essentially review[s] for 'harmless error.' If \ndefense counsel failed to do so and the trial judge did not intervene sua \nsponte, [the Delaware Supreme Court] reviews only for plain error.,, \nSpence v. State, 129 A.3d 212, 218 (Del. 2015). \nUnder the harmless error analysis, the [Delaware Supreme] Court will first \nconduct a de novo review of the record to determine whether misconduct \ntook place. If [that court] concludes there was no misconduct, [the] analysis \nends. If the [Delaware Supreme Court does] determine that the prosecutor \nengaged in misconduct during trial, [it] then, under the second step of the \nanalysis, \"determine[s] whether the [ ] misconduct prejudicially affect[ed] \n[the] defendant's substantial rights\" under the three-factor Hughes test. \nUnder Hughes, \"'[t]he decisive factors are the closeness of the case, the \ncentrality of the issue affected by the (alleged) error, and the steps taken to \nmitigate the effects of the error.'\" \nWhere the prosecutorial misconduct \"fails\" the Hughes test ... and otherwise \nwould not warrant reversal, [the Delaware Supreme Court] examine[s] \nHunter \u007f-the third step in the harmless error analysis for prosecutorial \nmisconduct-considering whether the prosecutor's statements or \nmisconduct are repetitive errors that require reversal because they cast \ndoubt on the integrity of the judicial process. \nCannon v. State, 165 A.3d 288 (Del. 2017). This Court has consistently held that \nDelaware's standard for evaluating prosecutorial misconduct claims is consistent with \nDonnelly and its progeny. See, e.g., Price v. Phelps, 894 F. Supp. 2d 504, 525-526 (D. \nDel. 2012). \n14 accomplished informant. He looks them in the face, he deceives them, he lies to them, \nhe gets paid for it, he's a professional liar, that's what he is.\" (D.I. 20-1 Oat 22) When \ndiscussing Boston's identification of Petitioner as the shooter in 2013 and how his \nstatement differed from the one he gave to police in 2011, trial counsel argued: \nAll of a sudden the story is changed. Right? Two years ago \nthe guy was wearing a tank top, a white wife beater tank top. \nNow he's not wearing a shirt at all. How does that happen? \nIs he trying to comport his story to the girl's story to make him \nlook more credible, to get help for his case? This is a man \nwho lies for a living, he gets paid to be a liar? \n(/d.) During its rebuttal closing argument, the State responded, without objection, \n\"When you are encouraged to speculate and there's no evidence to fuel the speculation, \nyou should reject that suggestion because it's contrary to the oath you took\" to decide \nthe case based on the evidence. (D.I. 20-10 at 29) The State then argued that no \nevidence had been presented at trial suggesting that Boston changed his testimony in \nJune 2013 because he knew what Brianna and Dajuan'ya told police two years earlier. \n(D.I. 20-5 at 35-36) The State also argued, without objection, that Boston had not \nreceived a benefit for his testimony: \n(Id.) Now, you remember [trial counsel], when he was talking about \nit, said we don't know if he received a benefit. Well, actually \nwe do because Thurman Boston told you that he and the \nprosecutor who handled the case told you the same thing. \nAnd there's no evidence to the contrary. \nAs he did in the Delaware state courts, Petitioner now contends that the State \nimproperly shifted the burden of proof to the defense during its rebuttal closing \nargument by asserting that the jury should not speculate about the reasons for Boston's \n15 differing statements. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected this argument on direct \nappeal after determining that the State's assertion was not improper. \n\"[l]t is the province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing witnesses.\" \nKansas v. Ventris, 556 U.S. 586, 594 n* (2009). Viewed in context, the State's \ncomment about the \"rule against speculation\" properly encouraged the jury to assess \nwitness credibility based on record evidence, not speculation. The comment did not \nimproperly shift the burden of proof because, in essence, it simply asserted that the \nevidence did not support the defense's claims about Boston. See Kent, 2016 WL \n1039125, at *4. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court did \nnot unreasonably determine the facts or unreasonably apply clearly established federal \nlaw in holding that the State did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct when making \nits comment about the \"rule against speculation.\" \n2. Petitioner's letter to nephew and Archy's testimony \nDuring closing, trial counsel argued that Petitioner wrote a letter to his nephew \nasking for help in finding witnesses. (D.I. 20-10 at 27) According to trial counsel, the \nletter stated: \"If they say the same shit in court, they are going to convict me.\" (Id.) In \nrebuttal, the State argued that the defense's suggestion did not support the idea that \nPetitioner wrote the letter in an attempt to support the investigation. (Id. at 33) \nSpecifically, the State asserted that \"trial counsel didn't read this sentence: 'If they say \nthe same stuff in court they're going to convict me.\"' (Id.) The Superior Court called the \nparties to a sidebar and admonished the State because its assertion that trial counsel \nhad not read the end of the letter was factually incorrect. (Id.) The Superior Court \nordered the State to \"clean it up.\" (Id.) Upon resuming its closing, the State said, \n16 \"Ladies and gentlemen, my recollection is not always perfect. I am informed that [trial \ncounsel] read that last sentence and I apologize to you and to [trial counsel].\" (Id.) \nAlso during closing, the State made the following comment about Archy's \ntestimony: \"Well, what we know from all the other witnesses is that the sound that \nWallace Arch[y] is talking about is the gunshot and that immediately after the gunshot \nthe car took off and was moving quickly down the street.\" (D.I. 20-10 at 35) Petitioner \nobjected and, at a sidebar, stated that \"Mr. Arch(y's] testimony or statement to the police \nwas that he heard the sound and then 10 to 15 seconds later is when he saw the car.\" \n(Id.) The State offered to \"fix that\" and, upon resuming its argument to the jury, \nprovided the following clarification: \"Wallace Arch[y], I think, said to the police he heard \na gunshot, 10 or 15 seconds later he looks into the intersection, sees a car going \nthrough it.\" (Id.) \nIn his motion for new trial, Petitioner complained about both of the \naforementioned comments by the State. Petitioner argued that the State's comment \nabout Petitioner's letter to his nephew improperly shifted the burden of proof to \nPetitioner. (D.I. 20-10 at 70-71) Petitioner also argued that the \"steps taken to mitigate \nthe effects of the error [made with respect to Archy's testimony] were not enough to \nensure that [Petitioner] had a fair trial,\" because the State provided its clarification \nwithout acknowledging that its prior comment about Archy's testimony was factually \nincorrect. (D. I. 20-10 at 73) \nWhen denying Petitioner's motion for new trial, the Superior Court only explicitly \naddressed Petitioner's argument about Archy's testimony. (D.I. 20-10 at 125-136) The \nSuperior Court held that the \"State's description of 'immediately after' in its appropriate \n17 context clearly shows that the prosecutor was making the point that the witness wasn't \nlooking towards the intersection until after he heard the gunshots\" and that the \"State's \nargument ... had nothing to do with the period of time it took Archy to look after \nhearing the gunshot.\" (D.I. 20-10 at 136) The Superior Court concluded that \"the \ndifference between 'immediately after' and '10 to 15 seconds later' is not only splitting \nhairs, but irrelevant. Accordingly, the minor difference that [Petitioner] challenges was \nnot improper, nor was it prosecutorial misconduct.\" (Id.) \nOn direct appeal, Petitioner again argued that the State's inaccurate comments \nabout Petitioner's letter to his nephew and Archy's testimony constituted prosecutorial \nmisconduct. The Delaware Supreme Court held that, while the State's inaccurate \nstatements arguably constituted misconduct, the inaccurate statements were corrected \nimmediately. See Kent, 2016 WL 1039125, at *4. As a result, the Delaware Supreme \nheld that the trial court did not err in denying Petitioner's motion for new trial on the \nbasis of the State's inaccurate comments. See id. \nAfter reviewing the record, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme \nCourt reasonably applied clearly established federal law in rejecting the instant two sub\u00ad\narguments of Claim Two. First, the Delaware Supreme Court properly examined the \nState's comments in the context of the entire trial. Second, any prejudice from the \nState's improper assertions was cured by the Superior Court calling the two side-bars, \nits act of providing the State with an opportunity to correct its misstatements, and the \nState's immediate apology regarding its comment about Petitioner's letter and its \nclarification about Archy's testimony. (D.I. 10-20 at 33) \nIn addition, there was substantial evidence of Petitioner's guilt. Petitioner shot \n18 Lee in the presence of three eyewitnesses whose testimony, if believed, established \nPetitioner's guilt. \nAfter viewing all of these factors in context with the entire trial, the Court \nconcludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied clearly established \nfederal law in holding that the State's comments about Petitioner's letter to his nephew \nand Archy's testimony did not so infect the trial with unfairness so as to constitute a \ndenial of due process. Accordingly, the Court will deny the two instant sub-arguments \nof Claim Two for failing to satisfy\u00a7 2254(d). \nC. Claim Three: Conflict of Interest \nShortly after [the two attorneys from the OPD were] appointed, \n[Petitioner's] counsel sent the State a discovery request, \nwhich included a request for a list of the State's witnesses. \nThe State responded, but did not provide a list of witnesses, \nciting concerns for the witnesses' safety. This concern may \nhave received some confirmation in May 2014 when \nWilmington Police came into possession of a letter from \n[Petitioner] requesting that his nephew locate the witnesses \nto the crime. \nOn July 16, 2014, defense counsel again requested a witness \nlist. One reason defense counsel requested the names of the \nwitnesses was to identify potential conflicts of interest. The \nState requested a protective order for the witness list on July \n29, 2014, protecting against disclosure of the names to the \ndefendant. In the weeks that followed, a number of witness \nstatements were provided to [Petitioner's] attorneys. \n* * * \nDuring pretrial proceedings, the trial court also heard \narguments regarding a potential conflict of interest resulting \nfrom the [OPD's] representation of [one of the three \neyewitnesses -Boston -] in an unrelated matter. At the trial \ncourt's request, [Petitioner] filed a memorandum of law \nrequesting that the [OPD] be allowed to withdraw as \n[Petitioner's] counsel, or in the alternative, prohibiting Boston \n19 from being called as a witness. On August 26, 2014, the trial \ncourt requested additional information in support of \n[Petitioner's] motion for an in-camera review. [Petitioner's] \ntrial counsel declined to provide the additional information \nrequested on the grounds that Boston did not give permission \nto release confidential information. On September 2, 2014, \nthe trial court reminded [Petitioner's] trial counsel that it could \nreveal Boston's confidential information upon court order, but \ncounsel did not respond or comply with the trial court's request \nuntil after the trial court informed counsel of its decision to \ndeny the request. \nThe trial court issued an opinion denying [Petitioner's] motion \nto prohibit Boston from being called as a witness or for \nappointment of new counsel on September 3, 2014. The \nrepresentation of Boston had concluded by March of 2014, \napproximately six months before [Petitioner's] trial. The trial \ncourt found that [Petitioner's] trial counsel failed to meet their \nburden of showing that a conflict did exist because the only \nevidence offered was an alleged conflict due to Boston's \nmental health history, which the trial court determined was \npublic knowledge. Without any other evidence, the trial court \nheld that there was no actual conflict regarding the \nrepresentation of Boston on the unrelated charges. \nKent, 2016 WL 1039125, at *1-2. \nIn Claim Three, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court erred by not \nconcluding that trial counsel had a conflict of interest, and that the court should have \neither granted his motion to exclude Boston's testimony or have appointed new counsel \nto represent him. (D.1. 15 at 9-10) Petitioner asserts that a presumption of prejudice \narose from trial counsel's actual conflict and that the \"Delaware courts thus applied the \nwrong standard of law.\" (Id. at 11) Distilled to its core, Petitioner's argument appears to \nbe that the Delaware courts conducted an inadequate inquiry into the conflict-of-interest \nissue. \nOn direct appeal, Petitioner argued that the Superior Court \"erred in denying his \n20 motion [for the OPD] to withdraw or prohibit Boston from testifying because another \nattorney from the [OPD] represented Boston, which created a conflict of interest with his \ntrial counsel.\" Kent, 2016 WL 1039125, at *3. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected \nPetitioner's argument and affirmed the Superior Court's decision, opining that Petitioner \n\"fail[ed] to show how he was prejudiced when the [OPD] represented Boston in matters \nthat are completely unrelated to this case.\" Id. The Court views the Delaware Supreme \nCourt's decision as an adjudication of Claim Three. Therefore, Petitioner will only be \nentitled to habeas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was either contrary \nto, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant \"the right to adequate \nrepresentation by an attorney of reasonable competence and the right to the attorney's \nundivided loyalty free of conflict of interest.\" United States v. Gambino, 864 F.2d 1064, \n1069 (3d Cir.1988). It is well-settled that an attorney's concurrent multiple \nrepresentation violates the Sixth Amendment if it creates an actual conflict of interest \nthat adversely affects the lawyer's performance. See Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, \n350 (1980); see also Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 482 (1978). When \npresented with a timely objection to concurrent multiple representation, a state trial court \nis required to initiate an inquiry into whether an actual conflict of interest exists or will \nprobably develop during the course of a trial. See Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 348; Wheat v. \nUnited States, 486 U.S. 153, 160 (1988). A trial court satisfies this threshold duty of \ndetermining if disqualification is appropriate by conducting \"an evidentiary hearing or \nfactual inquiry [ ... ] into the nature of the conflict and the client's awareness of the \nconflict.\" Gov't of Virgin Islands v. Zepp, 748 F.2d 125, 139 (3d Cir. 1984). \n21 Pursuant to Sullivan, a \"defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually \naffected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to \nobtain relief.\" Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 349-50. Although the Supreme Court has not yet \nheld that Sullivan's presumed prejudice standard applies to conflicted successive \nrepresentation,3 the Third Circuit has applied the principles established in Sullivan to at \nleast one case involving successive representation. Harmer v. Sup't Fayette SCI, 2021 \nWL 3560666, at *3 n.6 (3d Cir. Aug. 12, 2021) (\"We therefore assume without deciding \nthat Sullivan applies in cases of successive representation.\"). Consequently, when a \npotential conflict of interest is due to successive representation, a habeas petitioner in \nthis circuit establishes an actual conflict by showing the following two elements: \nFirst, he must demonstrate that some plausible alternative \ndefense strategy or tactic might have been pursued. He need \nnot show that the defense would necessarily have been \nsuccessful if it had been used, but that it possessed sufficient \nsubstance to be a viable alternative. Second, he must \nestablish that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict \nwith or not undertaken due to the attorney's other loyalties or \ninterests. \nClearly, a defendant who establishes that his attorney \nrejected a plausible defense because it conflicted with the \ninterests of another client establishes not only an actual \nconflict but the adverse effects of it. \nUnited States v. Gambino, 864 F.2d 1064, 1070-71 (3d Cir. 1988) (cleaned up); see \nHarmer, 2021 WL 35066, at *3 (applying Gambino's standard for determining the \nexistence of an actual conflict to a successive representation case). The \"critical inquiry \nis whether counsel actively represented conflicting interests.\" Zepp, 7 48 F .2d at 135. \nThere must be a point where \"the defendants' interests diverge with respect to a \n3See Mickens v. Taylar, 535 U.S.162 (2002). \n22 material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.\" Sullivan v. Cuyler, 723 F.2d \n1077, 1086 (3d Cir. 1983). This could result from refusing to cross-examine a witness, \nfailing to respond to inadmissible evidence, or failing to \"diminish the jury's perception of \na [co-conspirator's] guilt.\" Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 349. A petitioner can also show that \nthe attorney failed to pursue an alternative strategy that \"(a) could benefit the instant \ndefendant and (b) would violate the attorney's duties to the other client.\" United States \nv. Morelli, 169 F.3d 798, 811 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasis omitted). Such an alternative \nstrategy need not \"have been successful if it had been used\" but must have \"possessed \nsufficient substance to be a viable alternative.\" Gambino, 864 F .2d at 1070. \nIn this case, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not refer to United States \nSupreme Court precedent in affirming the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner's conflict\u00ad\nof-interest motion, its decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application \nof, clearly established federal law. In July 2014, once the State identified Boston as a \nwitness, trial counsel immediately informed the Superior Court that another OPD \nattorney had represented Boston on charges unrelated to Petitioner's case from April \n2013 to March 2014. See State v. Kent, 2014 WL 5390481, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. \n3, 2014). The Superior Court held an office conference to discuss the OPD's potential \nconflict on August 1, 2014, and ordered the parties to submit supplemental \nmemorandum on whether a conflict existed and how to resolve it. (D.I. 20-3 at 28) At \nthe office conference, trial counsel informed the Superior Court: \nDuring the course of representing Mr. Boston, [the OPD] used \n[its] staff, [its] services psycho-forensic evaluator to gather \ndocumentation of Mr. Boston's psychiatric treatment, \nparticularly medications that he was on, and from that \ninvestigation or from that, gathering that evidence, [the OPD] \n23 learned and through the course of attorney/client privilege that \n[the OPD] ha[s] with Mr. Boston, [the OPD] understand[s] that \nhe is being treated for psychological issues. \n(D.I. 20-3 at 24) Trial counsel also claimed that \"[t]hose medications have side effects, \nwhich affect [Boston's] ability to perceive and, you know, observe.\" (/d.) \nIn their subsequent memorandum to the Superior Court, trial counsel claimed \nthat \"[a]s part of Mr. Boston's defense, the Public Defender's psycho-forensic evaluator \ncompleted an assessment of Mr. Boston,\" and the OPD \"accessed and reviewed his \nmedical records and prescription information.\" (D. I. 20-3 at 31) Trial counsel also said \nthat \"[t]hese files are still currently located in the office.\" (Id.) Trial counsel requested \nthat the Superior Court \"prohibit the State from calling Thurman Boston in its case-in\u00ad\nchief or in the alternative appoint new counsel for [Petitioner].\" (Id. at 36) On August \n26, 2014, the Superior Court advised the parties that trial counsel have \"the burden of \npresenting issues showing a conflict.\" (Id.) The Superior Court found that \"Boston's \nmental health history is public knowledge,\" and it ordered trial counsel to file \"helpful \ninformation to support [Petitioner's] motion\" for an in camera review by August 29, 2014. \n(Id.) Trial counsel responded that they were unable to provide such information \nbecause \"Boston had not given Defense Counsel permission to reveal confidential \ninformation.\" (Id.) \nOn September 2, 2014, the Superior Court reiterated its prior instruction about \ntrial counsel providing additional information and advised that trial counsel was \npermitted to reveal a client's confidential information upon Court order. See Kent, 2014 \nWL 5390481, at *1. Because trial counsel failed to provide additional information about \nthe conflict, on September 3, 2014, the Superior Court denied trial counsel's request to \n24 withdraw by email. Id. On the same day, the Superior Court issued an opinion finding \nthat the OPD's successive \"representation of Boston and [Petitioner] are not \nsubstantially related\" for purposes of Delaware Lawyers Rules of Professional Conduct. \nId. at *3. The Superior Court determined that trial counsel had \"offered a merely \nconclusory assertion that [trial counsel] was in possession of confidential information \nthat would be materially adverse to Boston if used against him for impeachment \npurposes at [Petitioner's] trial.\" Id. at *4. The Superior Court also found that \"Boston's \nmental health history is public knowledge and informed the parties as such.\" Id. The \nSuperior Court concluded that \"there is no actual conflict of interest and Defense \nCounsel's continued representation of [Petitioner] is appropriate.\" In reaching this \nconclusion, the Superior Court recited Sullivan's standard for determining the existence \nof an actual conflict of interest, and applied that rule to facts of Petitioner's case within \nthe framework established by Delaware caselaw and Delaware's Rules of Professional \nConduct concerning successive representation. See Kent, 2014 WL 5390481, at *3-4. \nAt trial, trial counsel noted that they had emailed the Superior Court ex parte with \nadditional information about the alleged conflict. (0.1. 20-9 at 133) The Superior Court \njudge noted that he \"had already ruled and [he] saw an e-mail from [trial counsel] \ngoverning conflict of interest. [He] ha[d] not opened it.\" Id. Subsequently, the State \ncalled Boston to testify in its case-in chief. (D.I. 20-9 at 203) Boston explained his past \ninteractions with Petitioner, what he saw during Lee's shooting, his relationship with the \npolice as a paid informant, his history of mental illness, his past convictions, and his \ninconsistent statements to the police about his recollection of the shooting. (Id. at 205-\n222) Trial counsel cross-examined Petitioner about his conflicting statements to the \n25 police, as well as his motive for providing information to the police about the shooting. \n(Id. at 224-231) \nThis record demonstrates that the Superior Court satisfied its threshold duty of \ninquiry into the OPD's alleged conflict with Boston. Significantly, even though the \nSuperior Court provided the OPD with an opportunity to prepare a record for the state \ncourt's consideration of the conflict issue, the OPD failed to provide any information \nconcerning the alleged confidential information regarding the OPD's representation of \nBoston to support its conclusory assertion of a conflict. The Delaware Supreme Court \nreasonably relied on the Superior Court's attempts to have the OPD establish a record \nto support Petitioner's conflict claim and reasonably relied on the Superior Court's \ndetermination that Petitioner did not meet his burden. Notably, Petitioner did not \ndemonstrate that the OPD's interests and his interests diverged \"with respect to a \nmaterial factual or legal issue or to a course of action,\"4 nor did he identify \"that some \nplausible defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued ... [and] that the \nalternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the \nattorney's other loyalties or interests.\" Gambino, 864 F.2d at 1070. As a result, the \nCourt concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably determined the facts in \nfinding that Petitioner did not provide sufficient evidence of an actual conflict of interest. \nAdditionally, although the Delaware Supreme Court did not reference Sullivan or its \nprogeny when affirming the Superior Court's rejection of Petitioner's conflict of interest \nargument, the state court's focus on Petitioner's failure to provide sufficient information \nto support his allegation of a conflict mirrors the inquiry required by Sullivan and its \n4Zepp, 748 F.2d at 135. \n26 progeny. Thus, the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was not contrary to clearly \nestablished federal law. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court also reasonably concluded that Petitioner was not \nprejudiced by the OPD's representation of Boston in the unrelated matter. The record \nshows that trial counsel extensively cross-examined Boston about his inconsistent \nstatements to the police describing the shooter as well as his motive in eventually \nidentifying Petitioner as the perpetrator. To the extent Petitioner asserts that trial \ncounsel was unable to cross-examine Boston about his mental health, Petitioner has \nnot shown how Boston's mental health would have been probative to impeach his \ntestimony. Notably, while cross-examining Boston, trial counsel also asked to approach \nat a sidebar. (0.1. 20-9 at 232) There, trial counsel referred to the \"prior conflict issue \nabout the mental health records\" and stated that he \"just want[ed] to make a record, \n[he's] making a tactical decision not to raise [Boston's] mental health issue just in case.\" \n(Id.) Trial counsel also represented that he \"had a general discussion with Mr. Boston \nabout the fact that he was represented in 2013 by the [OPD] and would be cross\u00ad\nexamined by a different lawyer in the [OPD] in this case.\" (/d.) Trial counsel \"asked \n[Boston] if he had any concerns about it, [and] he said absolutely not.\" (/d.) \nBased on the foregoing, the Court will deny Claim Three for failing to satisfy the \nstandard in \u00a7 2254(d). \nD. Claim Four: Trial Counsel Did Not Provide Additional Information About \nThe OPD's Conflict-of-Interest In A Timely Manner \nIn Claim Four, Petitioner asserts that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance \n27 by belatedly providing additional information to the Superior Court about the OPD's \nconflict of interest due to its former representation of Boston. Petitioner contends that \nthe Superior Court instructed trial counsel that they could submit the information for an \nin camera review, but they waited until after the Superior Court issued its ruling denying \nPetitioner's motion to prohibit Boston from testifying or to appoint new counsel before \nproviding the new information. \nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not raise this argument in his initial Rule 61 \nmotion. Instead, he presented it in his first Rule 61 appeal when he responded to his \npost-conviction counsel's motion to withdraw under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 26 \n(c). See Kent, 2018 WL 3156987, at *4. The Delaware Supreme Court invoked \nDelaware Supreme Court Rule 8 and only reviewed the argument in Claim Four for \nplain error because Petitioner had failed to raise the argument in his initial Rule 61 \nmotion. The Delaware Supreme Court denied Claim Four after holding that there was \nno plain error.5 See Kent v. State, 189 A.3d 1255 (Table), 2018 WL 3156987, at *5 \n(Del. June 26, 2018). \nBy applying Rule 8 to deny Claim Four in Petitioner's first post-conviction appeal, \nthe Delaware Supreme Court plainly stated that its decision rested on state law \ngrounds. See Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 261 (1989). Delaware Supreme Court \n5Petitioner presented Claim Four in a second Rule 61 motion, which the Superior Court \nsummarily dismissed as procedurally barred under Rule 61 (d)(2) for being a successive \nmotion. (D.I. 20-14 at 51-53, 58) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision. \nSee Kent v. State, 225 A.3d 316 (Table), 2020 WL 411333, at *1 (Del. Jan. 24, 2020). \nSince the Delaware Supreme Court's application of Rule 8 to Petitioner's first Rule 61 \nmotion provides a sufficient reason to find that Claim Four is procedurally barred, the \nCourt need not consider whether the Delaware Supreme Court's application of Rule \n61 (d)(2) to Petitioner's subsequent Rule 61 motion provided a second layer of default. \n28 Rule 8 constitutes an independent and adequate state ground for procedural default \npurposes. See Campbell v. Bums, 515 F.3d 172, 182 (3d Cir. 2008). Thus, the Court \ncannot review the merits of Claim Four absent a showing of cause for the default, and \nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the Claim is not \nreviewed. \nPetitioner does not assert any cause for his default of Claim Four. 6 Although the \nabsence of cause obviates the need to address the issue of prejudice, the Court \nnevertheless concludes that Petitioner cannot establish that he has been prejudiced by \nthe default of Claim Four. Since, as previously explained, Petitioner failed to show that \nthe 0P0's prior representation of Boston in an unrelated proceeding created an actual \nconflict of interest, see supra at Section 111.C, Petitioner is not entitled to any \npresumption of prejudice based on the 0P0's representation in his case. \nAdditionally, Petitioner has not shown that the additional information concerning \nthe alleged conflict would have caused the Superior Court to either appoint new counsel \nto represent him or exclude Boston's testimony. Nothing in the record indicates that the \nadditional impeachment information concerning Boston's mental health issues would \neven have been admissible at trial. Petitioner does not allege or show that if the \nimpeachment evidence had been admitted it would have affected the jury's reception of \nthe testimony from the other eyewitnesses. \nFinally, the miscarriage of justice exception to the procedural default doctrine \n6Although Petitioner contends that his default of Claim Five should be excused under \nMartinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1, 9, 16-18 (2012) due to post-conviction counsel's failure to \nraise Claim Five in his initial Rule 61 motion, (see 0.1. 15 at 14-21), Petitioner does not \nassert the same argument with respect to his default of Claim Four. (0.1. 15 at 9-11) \n29 cannot be used to excuse Petitioner's default, because Petitioner has not provided any \nnew reliable evidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim \nFour as procedurally barred from federal habeas review. \nE. Claim Five: Counsel Did Not Call Shaleece Queen as an Alibi Witness \nNext, Petitioner contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not \ncalling Shaleece Queen to testify as an alibi witness. (D.I. 15 at 18-21) Petitioner \nasserts that Queen was not called as a witness because trial counsel did not thoroughly \ninvestigate and, therefore, incorrectly believed that Petitioner had fathered a child with \nQueen and that she lacked credibility. (Id. at 18) \nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for Claim Five \nbecause he did not fairly present the issue contained therein to the Delaware Supreme \nCourt in either his first or second Rule 61 proceeding.7 At this juncture, any attempt by \nPetitioner to present Claim Five in a new Rule 61 motion would dismissed as time\u00ad\nbarred under Rule 61(i)(1). See DeAngelo v. Johnson, 2014 WL 4079357, at *12 (D. \n7Petitioner did not present Claim Five in his first Rule 61 motion or appeal, but did raise \nit in his second Rule 61 motion. (0.1. 20-14 at 47-49) The Superior Court summarily \ndismissed Petitioner's second Rule 61 motion as barred under Rule 61(d)(2) for being a \nsecond or subsequent post-conviction motion. (Id. at 52-53) Although Petitioner \nappealed the denial of his second Rule 61 motion, he did not include Claim Five in his \nappeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. (0.1. 20-13) Instead, he argued that post\u00ad\nconviction counsel provided ineffective assistance in his initial Rule 61 appeal by failing \nto include Claim Five as part of his first Rule 61 appeal. (0.1. 20-13 at 7-10) An \nargument regarding post-conviction counsel's failure to properly investigate trial \ncounsel's failure to call Queen as a witness is not the same as an argument concerning \ntrial counsel's failure to call Queen as a witness. Given the substantial underlying \ndifference between the two arguments, the Court concludes that Petitioner did not fairly \npresent Claim Five to the Delaware Supreme Court in his second Rule 61 appeal. See, \ne.g., Glass v. Vaughn, 65 F.3d 13, 15 (3d Cir. 1995) (finding that an ineffective \nassistance of post-conviction counsel claim did not fairly present the issue of trial \ncounsel's ineffectiveness). \n30 Del. Aug. 15, 2014). Although Rule 61(i)(1) provides for an exception to the one-year \ntime limitation if the untimely Rule 61 motion \"asserts a retroactively applicable right that \nis newly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\" no such right is implicated \nin the instant Claim. Similarly, the exceptions to the bars in Rule 61 (i)(1) contained in \nRule 61 (i)(S) and (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner's case, because he does not allege \nactual innocence, lack of jurisdiction, or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to \nthe instant arguments. Given these circumstances, the Court must treat Five as \nexhausted but procedurally defaulted, meaning that the Court cannot review the merits \nof the Claim absent a showing of cause-and-prejudice or a miscarriage of justice. \nPetitioner attempts to establish cause under Martinez v. Ryan by arguing that \npost-conviction counsel's failure to include Claim Five in his initial Rule 61 proceeding \nwas due to post-conviction counsel's ineffective failure to review the OPD's entire \"161 \nlog notes.\" (D.I. 15 at 14-15). In Martinez, the Supreme Court held that inadequate \nassistance of counsel during an initial-review state collateral proceeding may (under \ncertain circumstances) establish cause for a petitioner's procedural default of a claim of \nineffective assistance of trial counsel. See Martinez, 566 U.S. at 12, 16-17. The Third \nCircuit has explained the application of Martinez in habeas cases: \nMartinez recognizes a narrow exception to the doctrine of \nprocedural default: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial\u00ad\nreview collateral proceedings may establish cause for a \nprisoner's procedural default of a claim of ineffective \nassistance at trial. This exception is available to a petitioner \nwho can show that: 1) his procedurally defaulted ineffective \nassistance of trial counsel claim has \"some merit,\" and that 2) \nhis state-post conviction counsel was ineffective under the \nstandards of Strickland v. Washington. \nWorkman v. Sup't Albion SCI, 915 F.3d 928, 937 (3d Cir. 2019). 'To demonstrate that \n31 his claim has some merit, a petitioner must 'show that reasonable jurists could debate \nwhether (or, for that matter, agree that} the petition should have been resolved in a \ndifferent manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement \nto proceed further.'\" Id. at 938 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003)). \nTo demonstrate that post-conviction counsel's ineffectiveness caused the procedural \ndefault, a petitioner must show that post-conviction counsel's performance was deficient \nunder the first prong of the Strickland standard, i.e., \"that his state post-conviction \ncounsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Workman, \n915 F.3d at 941. \nPetitioner has failed to demonstrate that post-conviction counsel's actions excuse \nhis default of Claim Five under the limited exception recognized in Martinez. First, \nPetitioner has failed to show that his underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim \nis substantial. In some circumstances, a trial attorney's decision not to call a given \nwitness can be strategically sound even though it is based on a potentially erroneous \nassumption. See Diggs v. Owen, 833 F.2d 439, 445-46 (3d Cir. 1987) (finding trial \ncounsel's decision not to call defendant's wife as alibi witness to be strategically sound \neven if it was based on an erroneous assumption that wife's refusal to testify before the \ngrand jury could be used to impeach her at trial because wife's testimony would have \nappeared self-serving and presenting her might have caused the jury to focus its \nattention on a defense that seemed contrived rather than on the possible weakness of \nthe state's case}. According to the OPD's log notes, trial counsel did investigate calling \nQueen as a witness at trial. As a result, trial counsel's failure to call Queen as a witness \nwas not due to a \"less than complete investigation.\" (D.I. 15 at 19) Petitioner also \n32 cannot demonstrate prejudice, which creates an additional barrier for showing that his \nunderlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim is substantial. For instance, in his \nsecond Rule 61 motion, Petitioner argued that Queen's testimony would have 11put[] the \ndefendant away from the scene during the time of the murder,\" and stated that she is \ncredible. (D.I. 20-14 at 48-49) Yet, Petitioner did not-and still does not-explain how \nQueen's testimony would have supported his alibi defense. \nSecond, Petitioner has not shown that post-conviction counsel's ineffectiveness \nduring his first Rule 61 proceeding caused the default. While it may be true that post\u00ad\nconviction counsel drafted Petitioner's amended Rule 61 motion before receiving all of \nthe OPD's log notes, post-conviction counsel did eventually obtain all of the notes and \nactually reviewed them before deciding to withdraw certain claims from Petitioner's first \nRule 61 motion. (D.I. 15 at 27) The fact that post-conviction counsel still did not include \nClaim Five in the amended Rule 61 motion after receiving and reviewing all of the \nOPD's log notes indicates that post-conviction counsel made a \"tactical choice\" to \nrefrain from including Claim Five and did not commit an error based on inadequate \ninvestigation. Workman, 915 F.3d at 942. In short, Martinez does not provide an \navenue for Petitioner to establish cause for his default. \nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice. \nAdditionally, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice will ensue \nif the Court does not review the merits of Claim Five. Petitioner's vague assertions \nabout Queen's allegedly exculpatory potential testimony does not constitute new \nreliable evidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Five \nas procedurally barred from federal habeas review. \n33 F. Claim Six: Cumulative Error \nIn his final Claim, Petitioner asserts that cumulative errors compromised his right \nto a fair trial and deprived him of due process. Petitioner presented the same \n\"cumulative error\" argument on direct appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, which \ndenied the argument as meritless. Therefore, Claim Six will only warrant habeas relief if \nthe Delaware Supreme Court's decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable \napplication of, clearly established federal law. \nThe United States Supreme Court has not recognized the concept of cumulative \nerror. See Bush v. Carpenter, 926 F.3d 644,686 n.16 (10th Cir. 2019). Since there is \nno clearly established federal law with respect to a cumulative error argument, it would \nappear that the Court's\u00a7 2254(d) analysis is over and Petitioner is not entitled to \nhabeas relief for Claim Six. \nNevertheless, the Third Circuit has recognized the cumulative error doctrine on \nhabeas review, holding that \"a cumulative error argument constitutes a stand-alone \nconstitutional claim subject to exhaustion and procedural default.\" Collins v. Secy of \nPa. Dep't of Corr. 742 F.3d 528, 542 (3d Cir. 2014). Pursuant to the cumulative error \ndoctrine, \n[i]ndividual errors that do not entitle a petitioner to relief may \ndo so when combined, if cumulatively the prejudice resulting \nfrom them undermined the fundamental fairness of his trial \nand denied him his constitutional right to due process. \nCumulative errors are not harmless if they had a substantial \nand injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's \nverdict, which means that a habeas petitioner is not entitled to \nrelief based on cumulative errors unless he can establish \nactual prejudice. \nFahy v. Hom, 516 F.3d 169, 205 (3d Cir.2008). Given the Third Circuit's recognition of \n34 the cumulative error doctrine in habeas proceedings, the Court will exercise prudence \nand review Claim Six. \nHere, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed and rejected each alleged \nunderlying error on its merits, and also rejected Petitioner's cumulative error argument \nwithout analysis because it found that his claims lacked merit. See Kent, 2016 WL \n1039125, at *4. As previously discussed, this Court has also concluded that Claims \nOne through Five lack merit. Since Petitioner has not provided anything to demonstrate \n\"actual prejudice\" even when the five Claims are considered together, the Court will \ndeny Claim Six as meritless. \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide \nwhether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011 ); 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \n\"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" by demonstrating \"that \nreasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims \ndebatable or wrong.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n484 (2000). \nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. \nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the \nCourt will not issue a certificate of appealability. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition must be \ndenied. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n35 "}
