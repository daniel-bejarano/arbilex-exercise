No. 21-365-CFC\nWARDEN ROBERT MAY et al., :\n\nDefendants.\n\nJudeau S. Brown, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nDecember 17, 2021\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, chid?audge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Judeau S. Brown, Jr., an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware, filed this lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 3) He\nproceeds pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.1I. 5)\nThe Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2) and \u00a7 1915A(a). Plaintiff has also filed a motion for injunctive relief. (D.I. 9)\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff alleges violations of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\" (D.I. 3 at 8) Plaintiff raises claims\nconcerning the failure of numerous correctional officers (all of whom are named\nDefendants) to wear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic from April 26, 2020 through\nFebruary 11, 2021. (/d. at 8-10) Plaintiff has filed numerous grievances over the issue.\n(Id. at 3) All grievances were referred to Defendant Captain Dodson for further\ninvestigation. (/d. at 10) Plaintiff sent Defendant Warden Robert May a \u201cnotice of\nintent\u201d via Defendant Lt. DeJesus regarding the failure of officers to wear facemasks.\n(Id.)\n\nPlaintiff alleges that officers and higher ranked staff deliberately and intentionally\n\nfailed to wear face masks with the intent of spreading the COVID-19 virus and this\n\n\u2018When bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that some person has\ndeprived him of a federal right, and that the person who caused the deprivation acted\nunder color of state law. See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).\nplaced him in an unreasonable amount of imminent danger of physical injury or death.\n(Id.) He also alleges that the failure to wear face masks violated the Governor's\nEmergency Order and is an inadequate measure to prevent spreading of COVID-19.\n(/d.) Plaintiff has not been tested for COVID-19. (/d.)\n\nPlaintiff seeks either bail pending the outcome of his petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus, $1,000 per mask violation, his conviction vacated and his immediate release, or\nto finish serving his sentence under house arrest. (/d. at 11-12) Plaintiffs motion for\ninjunctive relief is basically a reiteration of his Complaint with the addition of an\nallegation that Defendant Thongwong attempted to poison Plaintiff by placing a spider in\nhis cell. (D.I. 19, 20)\n\nIll. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A\\(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant);-42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (prisoner actions brought with respect to prison\nconditions). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\n\nAmended Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent\n\n2\nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at\n94 (citations omitted).\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Weitzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Belf\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\n\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Court takes judicial notice that face masks are worn by all correctional\n\nofficers and contract healthcare workers as a protection for inmates, officers and other\n\nemployees. See https://doc.delaware.gov/assets/documents/How_the_Delaware_DOC\n_is_containing_COVID19.pdf (last visited Nov. 16, 2021). From March through June\n2020, more than half of all DOC inmates were provided face masks, including those in\ninfirmaries, those with compromised immune systems, those with certain institutional\njobs, and all inmates at multiple facilities. /d. As of April 2020, face masks became\nmandatory for all correctional officers (correctional healthcare staff and some officers\nhad been wearing face masks for weeks). /d.\n\nIn order to state an Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim, a plaintiff\nmust allege that: \u201c(1) he was incarcerated under conditions imposing a substantial risk\nof serious harm, (2) the defendant-official was deliberately indifferent to that substantial\nrisk to his health and safety, and (3) the defendant official\u2019s deliberate indifference\ncaused him harm.\u201d See Bistrian v. Levi, 696 F.3d 352, 367 (3d Cir. 2012). Conditions\nof confinement violate the Eighth Amendment if they \u201calone or in combination . . .\ndeprive inmates of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\u201d See id. at 347.\n\n\u201cTo establish deliberate indifference [in the COVID-19 context, a plaintiff] must\nshow the Government knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to [his] health and\nsafety.\u201d Hope v. Warden York Cty. Prison, 972 F.3d 310, 325-31 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing\nNicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 811 (3d Cir. 2000). \u201cThus, where the [facility] has taken\nconcrete steps towards mitigating the medical effects of COVID-19 on a detention\nfacility, a prisoner will fall \u201cwell short of establishing that the [facility and its staff were]\ndeliberately indifferent toward [his] medical needs\u2019 in light of the virus even though\nthe[y] cannot entirely \u201celiminate all risk\u201d of contracting COVID, notwithstanding even\nserious pre-existing medical conditions the prisoner may have. /d. at 330-31.\n\nMoreover, courts have concluded that similar allegations do not support a plausible\n\n5\ninference that officials have demonstrated deliberate indifference to inmates\u2019 Eighth\nAmendment rights. See Wilkins v. Wolf, 2021 WL 1578250, at *7 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 22,\n2021) (concluding that complaint brought by another inmate in SCl-Huntingdon did not\nstate an Eighth Amendment claim upon which relief could be granted with respect to\nDOC\u2019s response to COVID-19); Bevins v. Kauffman, 2021 WL 322168, at *5 (M.D. Pa.\nFeb. 1, 2021) (concluding that complaint brought by SCI-Huntingdon inmate regarding\nprison's response to COVID-19 failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim upon which\nrelief could be granted).\n\nPlaintiff fails to state a claim for violation of the Eighth Amendment. As\ndiscussed above, the DOC has adopted detailed preventative steps to mitigate the risk\nto inmates and staff and to control the spread of COVID-19 throughout the state\ncorrectional institutions which include the use of masks. This Court may take judicial\nnotice of this information, as it is publicly available on a governmental website. See\nVanderlok v. United States, 868 F.3d 189, 205 (3d Cir. 2017). Also, a review of the\nDOC COVID-19 website suggests that DOC officials, including Defendants, have not\nacted unreasonably with respect to the threat posed by COVID-19 and instead have\ninstituted measures to safeguard the entire inmate population which includes Plaintiff.\nNor does Plaintiff allege any COVID-19 symptoms, lack of treatment for them, or\nexposure to individuals who presently have COVID-19. As pled, the Court \u201ccannot\nconclude that, when faced with a perfect storm of a contagious virus and the space\nconstraints inherent in a correctional facility, [Defendants] here acted unreasonably by\n\n\u2018doing their best.\u201d\u201d See Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2020).\nTherefore, Court will dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for violation of the\nEighth Amendment upon which relief can be granted.\nVv. | CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as moot Plaintiff's motion for\ninjunctive relief (D.1. 9); and (2) dismiss the Complaint for failure to state claims upon\nwhich relief can be granted. Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}
