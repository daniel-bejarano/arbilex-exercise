{"case_name": "Chen v. Education Testing Service, Inc.", "case_number": "22-580", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "03-01-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nHAIWEN CHEN, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nEDUCATIONAL TESTING \nSERVICE, Inc., \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 22-580-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nPlaintiffHaiwen Chen has sued Defendant Educational Testing Service, Inc. \n(ETS) for employment discrimination. Pending before me is ETS's Motion to \nDismiss Due to Lack of Personal Jurisdiction or, Alternatively, to Transfer Venue \nand for Failure to State a Claim for Relief. D.I. 5. I agree that this Court lacks \npersonal jurisdiction over ETS and that the interests of justice would be better \nserved by transferring this action to the District of New Jersey. I need not and do \nnot decide whether Chen's Complaint states a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted. I. BACKGROUND \nChen is 67 years old. D.I. 1 ,r 1. He lives in Bear, Delaware. D.I. 1 ,r 1. \nETS is a non-profit corporation incorporated in New York, D.I. 7-1 at 2, with its \nprincipal place of business in Princeton, New Jersey, D.I. 7,I 3; D.I. 1 ,r 2. ETS \nalso is registered to do business in Delaware. See D.I. 7,r 2. According to an ETS \ndeclaration, ETS does not own, operate, or lease any Delaware offices, facilities, or \nreal property; and it does not have any Delaware bank accounts. D.I. 7 ,r 4. \nChen began working for ETS in 2002. D.I. 1 ,r 7. When ETS hired Chen, \nChen worked in ETS 's Princeton office. But in 2010, Chen \"request[ ed] approval \nfor telecommuter status.\" D.I. 6-1 at 2. According to an email that Chen wrote, \nChen chose to move to Delaware because Chen's wife was involved in a car \naccident while she was commuting from Pennsylvania to Wilmington. D.I. 6-1 \nat 15. ETS agreed to Chen's request, and ETS and Chen executed an Alternate \nWork Site Agreement (A WA). Under the A WA, Chen could work from home on \nMondays, Thursdays, and Fridays. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, however, Chen \nstill had to report to ETS's Princeton office. D.I. 6-1 at 2-3. ETS also provided \nChen with a laptop that Chen agreed to use solely for work, and ETS reimbursed \nChen for relevant telephone and internet expenses. D.I. 6-1 at 3-4. Chen also \nagreed that he was \"responsible for any injuries and/or damages occurring on \n[Chen's] premises,\" that \"[w]orker's compensation claims will be handled by ETS \n2 according to the procedure used for on-site employee claims,\" and that \"ETS \nassumes no liability for injuries occurring to third parties ... that may occur at the \nalternate work site.\" Furthermore, \"[Chen agreed] to indemnify and hold ETS \nharmless for injury to third parties that may occur at the alternate work location.\" \nD.I. 6-1 at 2. Nothing in the A WA states that Chen's remote work was \nconditioned on his residence in Delaware. \nIn 2016, Chen and ETS executed an \"Alternate Worksite Agreement \nChange\" (AW AC). Under the AW AC, Chen became a full-time telecommuter. \nD.I. 6-1 at 7-9. Chen continued to use ETS equipment, and he continued to be \nresponsible for any injuries that might occur at his home office. D.I. 6-1 at 8. The \nAW AC also specifies that\"[ a ]ny zoning issues and tax consequences that must be \nconsidered are the employee's responsibility\" and \"[e]mployees are encouraged to \nmake certain that their tax location is accurate by reviewing their pay voucher as \nsoon as possible after an alternate work relationship has commenced.\" D.I. 6-1 \nat 9. Like the AW A, the AW AC did not state that Chen's remote work was \nconditioned on Chen's Delaware residence. To the contrary, the A WAC specified \nthat \"[e]mployees are required to change their work and home locations within \nPeopleSoft concurrent with any changes made to either location.\" D.I. 6-1 at 9; see \nalso D.I. 6-1 at 10 (\"If you moved or plan to move from your current home address \nat any time, you must update your home address location information in \n3 PeopleSoft and notify S WS . . . . The address change is critical to making certain \nthat your payroll taxation is accurate.\") ( emphasis in the original). \nAccording to the Complaint, ETS \"pa[id] [Chen's] income taxes and \nunemployment insurance tax to Delaware.\" D.I. 1 ,I 9. \nIn 2018, ETS informed Chen that he would have to start working in ETS's \nPrinceton office three days per week. D.I. 6-1 at 16-17. Chen responded by \ndefending his performance and explaining that he could not work at ETS three \ndays per week. Chen stated that he was primarily concerned that making the 90-\nmile commute to Princeton three days per week would harm his health. D.I. 6-1 at \n14-16. Chen and ETS exchanged numerous emails. Chen also hired an attorney. \nD.I. 6-1 at 19-24; D.I. 1 ,r,r 26, 35. After continued disagreements, Chen filed an \nage discrimination complaint pursuant to ETS' s Employment Polices and \nStandards. D.I. 1 ,I 20. Ultimately, on November 5, 2018, ETS fired Chen. D.I. 6-\n1 at 38. Chen now brings this lawsuit, alleging that ETS's conduct violated the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). D.I. 1 ,I,I 42-63, 69-86. Chen \nalso raises state law claims. D.I. 1 ,r,r 64-86.1 \n1 On February 3, 2022, the EEOC returned a determination that it would not \nproceed further with Chen's ADEA complaint. D.I. 1 ,r 6; D.I. 1-1 at 2. \n4 II. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA party may move to dismiss a case when the court lacks personal \njurisdiction over the party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). \"Once challenged, the \nplaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction.\" 0 'Connor v. \nSandy Lane Hotel Co., Ltd., 496 F.3d 312,316 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nWhen, as here, \"the court does not hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction \nand the plaintiff is entitled to have [his] allegations taken as true and all factual \ndisputes drawn in [his] favor.\" Miller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 \n(3d Cir. 2004). To establish personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, \nthe plaintiff ordinarily must satisfy both a statutory and a constitutional \nrequirement. For the statutory requirement, the court analyzes the long-arm statute \nof the state where the court is located. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e). For the constitutional \nrequirement, the court assesses whether exercising jurisdiction satisfies due \nprocess. See Toys \"R\" Us, Inc. v. Step Two, S.A., 318 F.3d 446, 451 (3d Cir. \n2003). \nNeither ofETS's briefs refer to Delaware's long-arm statute; ETS raises \nonly due process arguments. Thus, ETS has waived any argument that the Court \nlacks personal jurisdiction under Delaware's long-arm statute. See Laborers' Int'/ \n5 Union of N. Am., AFL-CJO v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d \nCir. 1994) (\"An issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief.\"). \nA federal court's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant is \nlimited by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Omni Cap. Int'/, \nLtd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 103-04 (1987). There are two kinds \nof personal jurisdiction: general and specific. General jurisdiction allows a court \n\"to hear any and all claims against\" a defendant. Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117, 122 (2014) ( citation omitted). Specific jurisdiction allows a court to hear only \nclaims \"deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes \njurisdiction.\" Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, \n919 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Chen \"admits that he \ncannot show general jurisdiction.\" D.I. 10 at 10. Therefore, Chen must prove that \nthere is specific jurisdiction. \n\"The inquiry as to whether specific jurisdiction exists has three parts. First, \nthe defendant must have purposefully directed [its] activities at the forum. Second, \nthe litigation must arise out of or relate to at least one of those activities. And \nthird, if the prior two requirements are met, a court may consider whether the \nexercise of jurisdiction otherwise comport[ s] with fair play and substantial justice.\" \n0 'Connor, 496 F.3d at 317 (alterations in original; internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). \n6 \"The first requirement, minimum contacts, has been defined as some act by \nwhich the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting \nactivities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its \nlaws.\" Toys \"R\" Us, 318 F.3d at 452 (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). The initial burden is on the plaintiff to \"establish[] with reasonable \nparticularity sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state\" that \ngive rise to the suit. Mellon Bank (E.) PSFS, Nat. Ass 'n v. Farino, 960 F.2d 1217, \n1223 (3d Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). Once the plaintiff has met this burden, the \ndefendant must \"present a compelling case that the presence of some other \nconsiderations would render jurisdiction unreasonable\" and thus offend traditional \nnotions of fair play and substantial justice. Miller Yacht, 384 F .3d at 97 ( quoting \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462,477 (1985)). \nIII. ANALYSIS \nIn specific jurisdiction cases, the purposeful availment requirement exists to \nprovide defendants with \"fair warning that a particular activity may subject them to \nthe jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign\" so that they \"will not be haled into a \njurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.\" \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472,475 (alterations, internal quotation marks, and \ncitations omitted). Thus, for there to be purposeful availment, the defendant's \nconnection with the forum state must be sufficiently substantial that the defendant \n7 \"should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\" Id. at 4 7 4 ( citations \nomitted). Courts have found purposeful availment and specific jurisdiction when a \ndefendant \"deliberately has engaged in significant activities within a State\" or has \n\"created continuing obligations between [itself] and residents of the forum.\" Id. at \n475-76 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In contrast, the mere \n\"unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident \ndefendant\" does not establish purposeful availment. Id. at 4 7 4 ( citation omitted). \nAlso, \"the state of a plaintiffs residence does not on its own create jurisdiction \nover [a] nonresident defendant[].\" Kennedy v. Help at Home, LLC, 731 Fed. \nApp'x 105, 108 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Marten v. Godwin, 499 F.3d 290,298 (3d \nCir. 2007)) (alterations in original). \nIn this case, Chen argues that the following suit-related actions justify the \nexercise of specific jurisdiction over ETS: ( 1) ETS approved Chen's telecommuter \nrequest; (2) ETS supplied Chen with office equipment and covered Chen's relevant \ntelephone and internet expenses; and (3) Chen's claims arise out of Chen's \nemployment relationship with ETS-a relationship that caused ETS to pay Chen's \nwages, withhold Chen's Delaware taxes, and ultimately allow Chen to collect \nDelaware unemployment. See D.I. 10 at 12; D.I. 119. But none of these \n8 actions-considered individually or collectively-support exercising specific \njurisdiction over ETS to adjudicate Chen's ADEA and state law claims.2 \nFirst, Chen worked as a Delaware telecommuter because he asked to, not \nbecause ETS told him to. ETS hired Chen to work in ETS's Princeton office. \nChen worked there for eight years. He stopped working in Princeton only because \nETS agreed to Chen's request to telecommute. And Chen only lived and worked \nas a Delaware telecommuter because Chen chose to move to Delaware. \nSecond, none of Chen's work as a Delaware telecommuter was directed at \nthe State of Delaware. Chen alleges in the Complaint that he was a member of \nETS's Psychometrics & Data Analysis Group. D.I. 1 ,I 8. But Chen does not \nallege in his Complaint, answering brief, or attached declaration that he performed \nany work directed at Delaware individuals, businesses, or other entities; or even \nthat he communicated with other Delaware-based ETS employees.3 Rather, it \n2 Usually, courts must \"assess specific jurisdiction on a claim-by-claim basis. \nHowever, it may not be necessary to do so for certain factually overlapping \nclaims.\" O'Connor v. Sandy Lane Hotel Co., 496 F.3d 312,317 n.3 (3d Cir. 2007) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Chen's ADEA and state law \nclaims all factually overlap because they all center around Chen's teleworking \nperformance and communications with ETS. I therefore need not analyze Chen's \nclaims separately. \n3 Three of the cases Chen cites in opposition to ETS 's motion are inapposite \nbecause the plaintiffs in those cases interacted with individuals, businesses, or \nentities located in the forum state. See Cossart v. United Excel Corp., 804 F.3d 13, \n17, 22 (1st Cir. 2015) (finding specific jurisdiction in Massachusetts where \nPlaintiff, a Massachusetts telecommuter of a Kansas-based employer, \"had \n9 appears that Chen communicated only with ETS employees who lived and worked \noutside of Delaware. See generally D.I. 1. \nThird, as district courts from this Circuit have uniformly held, paying a \nremote employee and withholding the employee's state and local taxes are not \nenough to subject the employer to the specific jurisdiction of the remote worker's \nstate of residence. See, e.g., Carlson v. Colo. Firearms, Ammunition & \nAccessories, LLC, 2022 WL 11398472, at *3-4 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 19, 2022) (finding \nno specific jurisdiction in Pennsylvania over Plaintiff, a Pennsylvania \ntelecommuter of a Colorado-based employer, even though the employee answered \nemails from Pennsylvania, was paid in Pennsylvania, and the employer deducted \nnumerous meetings and made cold calls in an effort to solicit business from various \nhospitals in Massachusetts\"); Winner v. Tryko Partners, LLC, 333 F. Supp. 3d 250, \n264 (W.D.N.Y. 2018) (finding specific jurisdiction in New York where Plaintiff, a \nNew York telecommuter of a New Jersey-based employer, \"provide[d] marketing \nservices in New York,\" the employer \"communicated with [the telecommuter] \nregularly in New York, and enlisted her representation at various business \nmeetings in New York\"); Stuart v. Churn LLC, 2019 WL 2342354, at *5 \n(M.D.N.C. June 3, 2019) (finding specific jurisdiction in North Carolina where \nPlaintiff, a North Carolina telecommuter of a New York-based employer, \"was \nworking to expand [Defendant's] business to North Carolina and [was] meeting \nwith potential distributors [t]here\"). The fourth case cited by Chen, Hall v. Rag-O\u00ad\nRama, LLC, 359 F. Supp. 3d 499 (E.D. Ky. 2019), is also inapposite. The \ndefendant in Hall was an Ohio-based employer that \"aggressively sought out [the \nemployee] for high-level employment\" with the knowledge that the employee lived \nin Kentucky and would work from Kentucky. Id. at 510. Here, in contrast, ETS \nhired Chen with the understanding that Chen would work in ETS's Princeton \noffice. Chen only worked from Delaware because he sought out telecommuter \nstatus. \n10 the appropriate Pennsylvania taxes from the employee's paychecks); Kearney v. \nGood Start Genetics, Inc., 2017 WL 6206168, at * 1, 5 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 8, 2017) \n(finding no specific jurisdiction in Pennsylvania over Plaintiff, a Pennsylvania \ntelecommuter of a Massachusetts-based employer, even though the employee \n\"primarily conducted work from his home in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania,\" and paid \nPennsylvania wage taxes); Grainer v. Smallboard, Inc., 2017 WL 736718, at *2 \n(E.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2017) {\"The fact that Smallboard.com made payments to \nPlaintiffs bank account in Pennsylvania, without more, does not establish specific \njurisdiction.\"). \nIn sum, ETS hired Chen to work as a full-time employee in ETS's Princeton \ncampus. After Chen requested telecommuter status, ETS acquiesced. ETS did not \ndirect Chen to work in Delaware, and Chen did not engage with any Delaware \nentities or individuals. All ETS did was approve Chen's telecommuter request, \nlend him a computer, and follow proper payroll practices. Those accommodations \nwere not activities purposefully directed at Delaware and it would be unfair to hale \nETS into a Delaware court to adjudicate Chen's employment-based claims. \nAccordingly, I find that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over ETS to \nadjudicate Chen's claims. \nI will not, however, dismiss Chen's claims, as I find that the interests of \njustice would be better served by transferring the case to the District of New \n11 Jersey. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (\"Whenever ... th[e] court finds that there is a want \nof jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action \nor appeal to any other such court ... in which the action or appeal could have been \nbrought at the time it was filed or noticed .... \") see also Island Insteel Sys., Inc. v. \nWaters, 296 F.3d 200,218 n.9 (3d Cir. 2002) (noting that the district court in that \ncase \"had authority, if it found that it lacked in personam jurisdiction, to transfer \nplaintiffs' first action\" to another district where personal jurisdiction and venue \nwere proper). ETS does not contest that personal jurisdiction is proper in the \nDistrict of New Jersey; on the contrary, it has separately moved to transfer the \naction to the District of New Jersey, see D.I. 5. Moreover, ETS is subject to \ngeneral jurisdiction in New Jersey because its principal place of business is in New \nJersey. See D.I. 7,I 3; see also Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137 (\"With respect to a \ncorporation, the place of incorporation and principal place of business are \nparadigm bases for general jurisdiction.\") (alterations, internal quotation marks, \nand citations omitted). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, I fmd that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction \nover ETS and that it is in the interests of justice to transfer the case to the District \nof New Jersey. \n12 The Court will enter an order consistent with this Memorandum . \nMarch 1, 2023 \nF JUDGE \n13 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nHAIWEN CHEN, \nPlaintiff, \nV.
