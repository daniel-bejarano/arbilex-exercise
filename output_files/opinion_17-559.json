{"case_name": "Praxis Energy Agents Pte Ltd. v. M/V Pebble Beach", "case_number": "17-559", "judge": "Judge Leonard P. Stark", "date": "12-06-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPRAXIS ENERGY AGENTS PTE. LTD., \nPlaintiff, \nV. C.A. No. 17-559-LPS \nMN PEBBLE BEACH \nIts engines, tackle, apparel, and freights, \nDefendant in rem. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nWHEREAS, on July 26, 2021, the Court issued an order (D.I. 84) awarding Sithonia \nShipholding S.A. (\"Sithonia\"), the owner of Defendant in rem, MN Pebble Beach, $170,402.01 \nin attorneys ' fees and costs incurred in connection with this lawsuit; \nWHEREAS, the order also required that Plaintiff Praxis Energy Agents Pte. Ltd. \n(\"Praxis\") pay an additional $27,527.33 into the Registry of the Court as countersecurity , \nrepresenting the difference between the award of attorneys' fees and the amount then being held \nin the Registry (see id.); \nWHEREAS , on August 9, 2021, Praxis filed a letter indicating that it was \"unable to \nmake [the] further deposit,\" citing reasons including that it had \"experienced a downturn in \nbusiness\" and that \"it no longer [was] operating \" (D.I. 85); \nWHEREAS , after the Court ordered Praxis to submit evidence sufficient to support its \nclaims of financial hardship (see D.I. 88), on August 17, 2021, Praxis submitted an affidavit of \nits Director, Theodosios Kyriazis, attesting to Praxis' lack of assets, strained liquidity , and \nmultiple pending claims against it (see D.I. 89-1 ); \n1 WHEREAS , on August 18, 2021, the Court issued an oral order excusing Praxis from \npaying the additional countersecurity (see D.I. 90), explaining: \n(Id.); The Court \"possesses broad discretion in deciding whether to order \ncountersecurity.\" CAC Mar., Ltd. v. Redbrick Ventures, Ltd., 2021 \nWL 3048405, at *2 (D. Del. July 20, 2021). \"In deciding whether \ncountersecurity should be ordered, two major principles govern: (1) \nparties should be placed on an equal footing with respect to security; \nand (2) Rule E(7) is not meant to be so burdensome so as to prevent \nthe bringing of the suit.\" Id. In view of Praxis' financial hardship \n(see D.I. 85, 89-1), the additional countersecurity appears to be \nburdensome. The parties are already placed on substantially equal \nfooting with the existing security and countersecurity deposited. \nWHEREAS, on August 30, 2021, the Court entered final judgment. (D.I. 93) Relevant \nto the instant motion, the final judgment provides: \n(Id.); The amounts [ of Praxis' countersecurity] held in the Registry of the \nCourt pursuant to the orders of the Court shall remain in the Registry \nof the Court until Praxis has paid the judgment for fees and costs, or \nuntil after all appeals (if any) have been ruled upon. \nWHEREAS, on September 24, 2021, Praxis filed a notice of appeal to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, appealing the final judgment and several of the Court's \nprior orders issued in the course of this lawsuit (D.I. 94); \nWHEREAS, on October 13, 2021, Sithonia filed the pending motion for an order for a \nsupersedeas bond or to enforce judgment (D.I. 97); \nWHEREAS, the Court has reviewed the parties' submissions filed in connection with \nSithonia's motion (see, e.g., D.I. 97-1, 98, 99); \nNOW, THEREFORE , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Sithonia's motion (D.I. 97) is \nDENIED. \n2 1. Contrary to Praxis' contention (see D.I. 98 at 1), the Court retains jurisdiction to \nconsider Sithonia's motion.1 \"The filing of a notice of appeal ... confers jurisdiction on the \ncourt of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case \ninvolved in the appeal.\" Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982). \nHowever , \"[a] district court, during the pendency of an appeal is not divested of jurisdiction ... \nto issue orders regarding the filing of bonds or supersedeas bonds.\" Venen v. Sweet, 758 F.2d \n117, 120 n.2 (3d Cir. 1985). \n2. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(b), a party may obtain a stay of \nexecution on a judgment by posting a supersedeas bond.2 However , \"courts may forego that \nrequirement when there are other means to secure the judgment creditor's interests.\" In re Diet \nDrugs (Phentermine /Fenfluramine /Dexfenfluramin e) Prod. Liab. Litig., 582 F.3d 524, 552 (3d \nCir. 2009); see also e.g., Montalvo v. Larchmont Farms, Inc., 2011 WL 6303247 , at *1 (D.N.J. \nDec. 15, 2011) (\"[D]istrict courts within the Third Circuit have found that they have discretion \nunder Rule 62(d) to waive the bond requirement in whole or in part.\"); Arban v. W Publ'g \nCorp., 345 F.3d 390,409 (6th Cir. 2003) (finding that Rule 62(d) does not constrain district \ncourts from granting stays in accordance with their discretion) ; Fed. Prescription Serv. v. Am. \nPharm. Ass'n, 636 F.2d 755, 757-58 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\"Rule 62(d) only operates to provide that \n1 The Court finds that it lacks jurisdiction with respect to Sithonia's request that the Court \"enter \nan Order releasing to Sithonia the funds currently held in the Court's Registry as partial \nsatisfaction of the final judgment. \" (D .I. 97-1 at 7) Granting this request would require the \nCourt to alter the final judgment currently on appeal, a judgment which provides that the funds \n\"shall remain in the Registry of the Court until Praxis has paid the judgment for fees and costs, \nor until after all appeals (if any) have been ruled upon.\" (D.I. 93) Thus, this aspect of Sithonia's \nrequest is denied without prejudice. \n2 Rule 62(b ), as amended in 2018, carries forward the supersedeas bond provisions of former \nRule 62( d) in a modified form. \n3 an appellant in all cases may obtain a stay as a matter of right by filing a supersedeas bond, and \ndoes not prohibit the district court from exercising a sound discretion to authorize unsecured \nstays in cases it considers appropriate.\"). The purpose of the supersedeas bond is \"to preserve \nthe status quo during the pendency of an appeal and protect the winning party from the \npossibility of loss resulting from the delay in execution .\" VICI Racing, LLC v. T-Mobile USA, \nInc., 921 F. Supp. 2d 317, 335 (D. Del. 2013). In \"extraordinary circumstances,\" courts may \nexercise their discretion to waive the requirement of a supersedeas bond where \"posting a full \nbond is impossible or impracticable,\" and where alternative means will \"provide adequate ( or as \nadequate as possible) security\" for the judgment creditor's interest. See Grand Entm 't Grp., Ltd \nv. Star Media Sales, Inc., 1992 WL 114953, at *2 (E.D. Pa. May 18, 1992). \n3. Here, exceptional circumstances warrant a stay of enforcement of the judgment \nwithout requiring Praxis to post a full bond. While Sithonia is correct that the Court's prior order \nexcusing Praxis from providing countersecurity for the full amount of the judgment applied a \ndifferent legal standard and, so, is \"not the same\" as a ruling that Praxis need not post a full bond \nfor the final judgment pending appeal (see D.l. 97-1 at 5-6), the Court's factual finding of Praxis' \nfinancial hardship underlying the prior order informs the Court's decision on the instant motion. \nAccording to the Kyriazis affidavit, Praxis \"has ceased operations and has no income, or, except \nfor the PEBBLE BEACH claims and approximately USD 8,000 bank account balance, no \nsubstantial assets.\" (D.I. 89-1 ,r 3) In the meantime , Praxis is facing more than $1.4 million in \npending claims against it. (See id ,r,r 4-8) Given Praxis' financial condition , requiring it to post \n4 a full bond, or even a bond equal to the difference between the award of attorneys' fees and the \namount currently held in the Registry of the Court, would be impracticable, if not impossible.3 \n4. Either ordering Praxis to post a bond or, in the alternative , allowing Sithonia to \nenforce the judgment against Praxis, would engender a substantial risk of driving Praxis into \ninsolvency, which -if it were to occur -would cause irreparable harm to Praxis, and would \"put \n[Praxis'] other creditors in undue jeopardy.\" Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. W Union Tel. Co., \n786 F .2d 794, 796 (7th Cir. 1986). Courts across jurisdictions have waived or reduced the bond \nrequirements that would result in a judgment debtor's insolvency . See, e.g., Miami Int'! Realty \nCo. v. Paynter, 807 F.2d 871, 874 (10th Cir. 1986) (finding that district court did not abuse \ndiscretion in granting stay without full supersedeas bond when judgment debtor \"was financially \nunable to post a full bond and that execution on the judgment would place him in insolvency \"); \nUtah Physicians for a Healthy Env 't, Inc. v. Diesel Power Gear, LLC, 2020 WL 4904188, at *2 \n(D. Utah Aug. 20, 2020) (finding that bond for less than full judgment was warranted where \ndefendant \"would be irreparably harmed in the form of insolvency , bankruptcy, the potential \nforeclosure of [Defendant's] home, and the termination of ... employees\"); Fed. Trade Comm 'n \nv. Commerce Planet, Inc., 2012 WL 13015007 , at *9 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2012) (staying \njudgment pending appeal based on reduced bond where judgment debtor \"cannot post a full bond \n3 Sithonia cites Evergreen Cmty. Power LLC v. Riggs Distler & Co., Inc., 2012 WL 2974891 \n(E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2012), for the proposition that the Court should apply the factors set out in \nDillon v. City of Chicago, 866 F .2d 902 (7th Cir. 1988), to determine whether an \"exceptional \ncircumstance\" exists. (See D.I. 97-1 at 3-5) The first four Dillon factors, however, appear to \nrelate to the scenario in which a judgment debtor has sufficient resources to satisfy the judgment \nbut posting a supersedeas bond would create \"an unnecessary waste of money\" or an \n\"administrative burden.\" See Evergreen , 2012 WL 3781538, at *2; Dillon, 886 F.2d at 904-05. \nThe fifth Dillon factor -\"whether the defendant is in such a precarious financial situation that \nthe requirement to post a bond would place other creditors of the defendant in an insecure \nposition\" (Dillon, 886 F.2d at 905) -is more pertinent here. \n5 for the $18.2 million judgment , and enforcement of the judgment would leave him insolvent \"); \nJack Frost Labs., Inc. v. Physicians & Nurses Mfg. Corp., 1996 WL 709574, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. \nDec. 10, 1996) (\"(W]here a judgment debtor would otherwise be in danger of being driven into \nbankruptcy pending appeal, a stay may be granted without the debtor posting a bond in the full \namount of the judgment.\") ; Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Dept., 944 F. Supp. 371,378 (D.N.J. \n1996) (granting stay without bond where there was \"strong likelihood that enforcement of this \njudgment would push (the judgment debtor] into bankruptcy\") ; C. Albert Sauter Co., Inc. v. \nRichard S. Sauter Co., Inc., 368 F. Supp. 501, 520 (E.D. Pa. 1973) (setting bond at less than full \namount of judgment where defendants \"(were] without sufficient assets to satisfy the judgment \nand [were] unable to obtain a bond in the amount of the verdict plus counsel fee and costs\"). \n5. In the Court's view, Praxis' countersecurity currently held in the Registry of the \nCourt-which accounts for more than 80 percent of the total attorneys' fees awarded- has \nprovided security for Sithonia's interest to an extent that is as practically adequate as possible \nunder the circumstances, and has placed the parties \"on substantially equal footing\" with regard \nto their respective securities for the judgment currently on appeal. (See D.I. 90) While \nSithonia' s judgment is not fully secured, that consideration is outweighed by the unfavorable \nconsequences of the reliefrequested by Sithonia, and is undermined by Sithonia's failure to \npersuade the Court that allowing it to enforce judgment before Praxis completes its appeal would \nincrease the probability of collecting the judgment in full. See Olympia Equip., 786 F .2d at 799. \nIn sum, this case presents \"exceptional circumstances \" warranting excusing Praxis from posting \na full bond for the final judgment pending appeal. \nDecember 6, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware \n6 Hb~1!h TARK \nUNITED STA TES DISTRICT JUDGE "}
