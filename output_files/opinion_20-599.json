Stark", "date": "12-07-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nWILLIAM D. BUSH, \nPlaintiff, \nV. C.A. No. 20-599-LPS \nTRITON SYSTEMS OF DELAWARE INC, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff William D. Bush sued Defendant Triton Systems of Delaware, LLC (\"Triton\") \nfor alleged violations of the antitrust laws and for breach of a mutual confidentiality agreement. \n(See generally D.I. 2 (\"Compl. \"); D.I. 20 (\"Am. Compl.\"))1 Pending before the Court is Triton's \nmotion to dismiss Bush's amended complaint. (D.I. 21) The Court previously granted Triton's \nmotion to dismiss Bush's original complaint but gave Bush, who proceeds prose, an opportunity \nto file an amended complaint. (D.I. 19 at 1, 12) Having reviewed the latest round of briefing \n(D.I. 22, 23, 24, 25) and other materials submitted by the parties (D.I. 5, 12), IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Triton's motion to dismiss the amended complaint (D.I. 21) is GRANTED , and \nthis case will be CLOSED . \n1 Like the caption of the original complaint, the caption of the amended complaint identifies \n\"Triton Systems of Delaware Inc\" as the defendant. (Compl. at 1; Am. Compl. at 1) After filing \nthe original complaint, Bush confirmed that he intended to name Triton Systems of Delaware , \nLLC. (D.I. 16 at #212) Like the original complaint, the amended complaint suggests that Bush \nwanted to name Does 1 through 55 as defendants , although they do not appear in the caption. \n(See Am. Compl. ,r,r 6, 7; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. l0(a) (\"The title of the complaint must name \nall the parties .... \")) While the amended complaint generally suggests that Does 1 through 55 \nare affiliates of Triton, the Court still cannot discern any additional information about who those \nindividuals may be. Accordingly , the Court treats Triton as the sole named defendant , as it did \nwith the original complaint. (See D.I. 19 at 1 n.l) \n1 BACKGROUND \nThis case involves Bush's work in the automated teller machine (\"ATM\") industry .2 \nBush filed his original complaint on April 30, 2020 (D.I. 1), and Triton subsequentl y moved to \ndismiss (D.I. 10, 11). After full briefing, the Court issued a memorandum order in March 2021 \nthat identified deficiencies in the original complaint , granted Triton's motion to dismiss, and \ngave Bush an opportunity to correct those deficiencie s by filing an amended complaint. (See \ngenerally D.I. 19) \nMuch of Bush's amended complaint is materially indistinguishable from the original \ncomplaint. Like the original complaint , the amended complaint alleges ( among many other \nthings) that, \"through means of illegal monopolization of industry, theft of trade secrets, and via \nunlawful use of interstate mail and wires , [Triton] conducted ongoing schemes to wrongfull y \nrestrict, block and misappropriate the income derived from trade secrets and financial assets of \nthe Plaintiff in violation of the Sherman-Clayton Acts.\" (Am. Compl. 171) \nThe amended complaint also contains three new \"Court Identified Amendment \nResponses. \" (Id. at 13-22) The first responsive section begins by addressing Bush's claim under \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act. Bush asserts that the \"combination of agreement and conspirac y \nbetween the Defendants ,\" including their adherence to \"associated network rules,\"3 results in \n\"unreasonable restraint of trade within the financial services industry at large.\" (Id. 186) \n2 The factual allegations in the amended complaint are highly similar to those in the original \ncomplaint. The Court's previous memorandum order contains an overview of factual allegations \nthat are common to both complaints. (See generally D.I. 19 at 2-5) In this order, the Court \nfocuses predominantly on Bush's new allegations . \n3 This allegation refers to rules issued by nonparties Visa, Inc. (\"Visa\") and Mastercard \nInternational Inc. (\"Mastercard \"), which operate prominent interbank networks for A TMs. (See \nD.I. 19 at 2) Those networks allow customers to use ATMs at banks other than their own. (Id.) \n2 (internal quotation marks omitted) In Bush's view, that conduct has caused him and other \nconsumers financial injury. (See id.) For example, Bush believes he \"has been injured in the \nloss of time, development investment and opportunity cost.\" (Id.) To further explain the \nexistence of a \"conspiracy,\" Bush points to Triton's alleged breach of a mutual confidentiality \nagreement. (See id. at 16-19) After the parties signed that agreement in April 2020, Triton \nshared \"high level\" information about Bush's proposed ATM features with an unidentified \nsponsor bank. (See id. at 17) \nThe second \"Court Identified Amendment Response \" addresses the \"monopolizing \nassociation of financial service companies restraining trade through rule making.\" (Id. at 20) \nThose \"financial service companies \" are Visa and Mastercard, which Bush believes \"to be \nconsidered the same functional entity, simply operating under different corporate names.\" (Id.) \nBush cites a 2020 case from the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which supposedly ruled \nthat \"Visa and Mastercard are operating as a monopoly fundamentally within the Federal \nReserve Banking System.\" (Id. )4 \nIn the final responsive section of the amended complaint, Bush alleges Triton violated a \nprovision of the Clayton Act regarding acquisitions of stock. (Id. at 21-22) Bush believes that \n\"individuals within or associated with Triton and Cardtronics\" are coordinating \"to maintain \ntheir monopolistic power grip on the financial services industry as a whole.\" (Id.) Bush further \nalleges that \"Cardtronics is Triton['s] largest client by far,\" and \"it would be smart to own all or \npart of your equipment manufacturer. \" (Id.) \n4 During the briefing on Triton's motion to dismiss the original complaint, Bush filed a motion to \njoin Visa and Mastercard to this case. (See generally D.I. 16) The Court denied that motion, \nconcluding that the complaint did not contain plausible allegations to pursue antitrust claims \nagainst either entity. (D.I. 19 at 11) \n3 LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the \nCourt to accept as true all material factual allegations in the operative complaint. See Spruill v. \nGillis, 372 F.3d 218,223 (3d Cir. 2004). '\"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail \nbut whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.'\" In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, \n236 (1974)). Therefore, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss \"only if, accepting all well\u00ad\npleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nWhen a plaintiff proceeds prose, his pleadings are liberally construed , so the Court holds \nsuch a complaint- even if \"inartfully pleaded\" -to \"less stringent standards than formal pleadings \ndrafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true \n( even if doubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F .3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) ( quoting \nBell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible \"when the \nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nUltimately, \"[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that \ndiscovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\" of a plaintiffs claim. Wilkerson v. \nNew Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315,321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nThe Court is not obligated to accept \"bald assertions \" as true. Morse v. Lower Merion \n4 Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is it \nobligated to credit \"unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences .\" Schuylkill Energy \nRes., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,417 (3d Cir. 1997). The Court may likewise \nreject allegations that are \"self-evidently false.\" Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996). \nDISCUSSION \nI. Motion to Dismiss \nThe Court understands Bush to be raising claims under the following statutory \nprovisions : (i) Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1; (ii) Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2; and (iii) Sections 7 & 8 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18 & 19. Even liberally \nconstruing the amended complaint , the Court concludes that Bush has not plausibly alleged any \nviolations. Nor has Bush adequately stated a claim for breach of the parties' mutual \nconfidentiality agreement. \nA. Sherman Act Section 1 \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, prohibits \"every contract ... or conspirac y, \nin restraint of trade or commerce .\" To state a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, a \nplaintiff must allege (1) an agreement , contract, combination , or conspiracy , (2) imposing an \nunreasonable restraint of trade within a relevant market, and (3) an accompanying antitrust \ninjury. See In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 314-15, 315 n.9 (3d Cir. 2010). \nThe Court previousl y concluded that the original complaint failed to allege an agreement \nor conspiracy between Triton and either the sponsor bank or Cardtronics. (D.I. 19 at 8-9) The \nsame issue afflicts the amended complaint. Because Triton turned to a sponsor bank for \"high \nlevel\" guidance about the Visa and Mastercard rules and \"scrip\" transactions, Bush alleges a \n\"conspiracy that goes beyond the ordinary course of business conversation. \" (Am. Compl. at 19) \n5 This contention was foundational to Bush's original complaint, and the Court expressly rejected \nit. (D.I. 19 at 8) (\"The complaint does not plausibly allege any agreement or conspiracy between \nTriton and the sponsor bank that goes beyond an ordinary business conversation.\") Bush fares \nno better by repeating the contention in his amended complaint. \nBush's \"Court Identified Amendment Responses \" do not allege any additional facts that \nmight support an agreement or conspiracy between Triton and Cardtronics. Bush's assertion of \nan \"agreement and conspiracy between the Defendants \" is unsupported and conclusory. (See, \ne.g., Am. Compl. ,r 86) Bush has again failed to plausibly plead facts to support an inference that \nTriton is part of an agreement or conspiracy that would potentially contravene the Sherman Act. \nSee Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nAccordingly, Bush has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted under \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act. \nB. Sherman Act Section 2 \nSection 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, \"requires '(1) the possession of monopoly \npower in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as \ndistinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business \nacumen, or historic accident.\"' Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 306-07 (3d \nCir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1966)). \nIn connection with the original complaint , Bush failed to allege that Triton willfully \nacquired or maintained any monopoly power; the Court found his allegations about a monopoly \nin the ATM industry were wholly unsupported by details. (D.I. 19 at 10) The amended \ncomplaint fares no better. \nBush asserts that Triton and the unidentified sponsor bank \"operate[ d] in coordination \n6 together within the financial services industry to monopolize an unfair advantage , inflicting \nfinancial injury to the consumers of Credit Card Cash Advances. \" (Compl. at 16) According to \nBush, \"[t]his monopoly restriction is happening so that the top tier lenders of the credit card \nindustry can make [exorbitant] and usury interest rates on 'cash advances' without the possibility \nof early repayment by the customer. \" (Id.) ( emphasis omitted) Because there are no specific \nallegations concerning the alleged monopoly , Bush's claim fails to meet the pleading standards. \nSee Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 664 (\"A court considering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying \nallegations that, because they are mere conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth. \nWhile legal conclusions can provide the complaint' s framework , they must be supported by \nfactual allegations.\") \nAccordingly , Bush has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted under \nSection 2 of the Sherman Act. \nC. Clayton Act \nOn the motion to dismiss the original complaint , the Court was unable to discern \nplausible allegations of conduct proscribed by the Clayton Act, such as price discrimination or \nexclusive dealings. (D.I. 19 at 10-11) Liberally construed , the original complaint may have \nbeen alleging interlocking directorates (Clayton Act Section 8), if Bush could identify \nindividuals at Triton and Cardtronics who overlap. It also may have been alleging unlawful \nstock acquisition (Clayton Act Section 7), if Bush could allege that Cardtronics or any other \ncompany owns Triton stock (or vice versa). (D.I. 19 at 11; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18 & 19; \nUnited States v. Sabre Corp., 452 F. Supp. 3d 97, 135 (D. Del.), vacated as moot, 2020 WL \n4916824 (3d Cir. July 20, 2020)) \nIn the amended complaint , Bush has not rectified the deficiencies. Rather, Bush again \n7 \"seeks discovery to further uncover whom the hidden individuals are.\" (Am. Compl. at 21) \nBush's allegations are admittedly based only on \"insider gossip and suspicious circumstance \ncorrelations. \" (Id.) Bush has not alleged facts to make out a plausible claim. See Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678 (\"A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\") \nBush requests to proceed with discovery but \"offers no explanation of why it is plausible \nthat such facts may be uncovered in discovery.\" Sapp v. Premier Educ. Grp., LP, 2016 WL \n6434137, at *8 (D.N.J. Oct. 28, 2016) (internal quotations marks omitted). Rather, Bush has a \nhunch that, because \"Cardtronics is Triton['s] largest client by far,\" a smart \"business investment \nstrategy\" would be \"to own all or part of your equipment manufacturer. \" (Am. Compl. at 21) \nBush must allege a plausible claim before subjecting Triton to the costs of discovery . See \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 559-60 (explaining that pleading standards help to \"avoid the potentially \nenormous expense of discovery in cases with no reasonabl y founded hope that the discovery \nprocess will reveal relevant evidence\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). As he \nhas failed to do so, Bush is not entitled to take discovery. \nAccordingly , Bush has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted under the \nClayton Act. \nD. Breach of Contract \nUnder Delaware law, 5 to state a claim for breach of contract, a party must show: (i) \"the \nexistence of the contract, whether express or implied\"; (ii) \"the breach of an obligation imposed \n5 The mutual confidentiality agreement is \"governed by and construed in accordance with the \nlaws of the State of Delaware , USA.\" (D.I. 5 Ex. A at 2) \n8 by that contract\"; and (iii) \"the resultant damage to the plaintiff.\" VLIW Tech., LLC v. Hewlett\u00ad\nPackard Co., 840 A.2d 606,612 (Del. 2003). Bush has not adequately stated a claim for breach \nof contract. \nBush has satisfactorily pled the existence of a contract, namely the \"Mutual \nConfidentiality Agreement \" from April 2020. (See generally D.I. 5 Ex. A) Bush has not, \nhowever, adequately alleged a breach. Bush contends that Triton breached the confidentiality \nagreement \"by not disclosing the unidentified sponsor bank\" with which Triton discussed the \nfeasibility of Bush's ticket-for-cash proposal. (Am. Compl. at 18) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) But no provision in the mutual confidentiality agreement imposes an obligation on \nTriton that it is plausibly alleged to have breached. 6 Moreover , Bush has explicitly conceded \nthat Triton has been released from its confidentiality obligations with respect to Bush's business \nplans. Bush acknowledges that \"filing his provisional patent application with the [U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office], and discussing his business development idea and plan with Mastercard \ndirectly ... generally nullifies Triton['s] prior obligation of 'confidential information' of the \nmaterial submitted into evidence with this court.\" (D.I. 23 at 1-2) (emphasis added) \n6 Bush and Triton generally agreed not to disclose each other's confidential information. (D.I. 5 \nEx. A \u00a7 1) Confidential information does not include information that \"is in the public domain at \nthe time of disclosure or later enters the public domain through no fault of the receiving party.\" \n(Id. \u00a7 3(i)) (emphasis added) Thus, a receiving party \"shall have no obligation with respect to\" \npublicly disclosed information , even if it was confidential at the time of disclosure. (See id.) \nFurther, \nIf a receiving party becomes compelled by law, judicial or administrative process \nor by governmental authority to disclose any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION , \nthe receiving party will provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice \nthereof so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other remedy \nthe disclosing party deems appropriate . \n(Id.\u00a7 2) \n9 Additionally, Bush's business plans entered the public domain when he included those plans in \ndocuments filed on the Court's docket. (See generally D.I. 2, 5, 20) \nThe Court cannot \"rewrite [a] contract to appease a party who later wishes to rewrite a \ncontract he now believes to have been a bad deal.\" Nemec v. Shrader, 991 A.2d 1120, 1126 \n(Del. 2010). Taking all allegations in the amended complaint as true, Bush has not plausibly \nalleged that Triton breached any provision of the confidentiality agreement. Accordingly , Bush \nhas failed to state a breach-of-contract claim on which relief may be granted. \nII. Leave to Amend \nAfter the original complaint was dismissed , the Court provided Bush with an opportunity \nto amend in order to cure any pleading defects. (D.I. 19 at 12 & n.9) As explained above, Bush \nfailed to cure those defects, and his new allegations suffer from additional defects. Bush states \nthat, \"[i]fthere is an additional technical deficienc y in [his] pleadings ,\" he \"requests further \nspecification from the court and leave to amend his complaint. \" (D.I. 25 at 6) The Court cannot \nprovide legal advice to Bush, and it perceives no reason to give him yet another chance to \namend. Instead, his two failed efforts lead the Court to conclude that amendment would be \nfutile. Thus, dismissal of the amended complaint is with prejudice. 7 \nIII. Motion for Consideration \nAfter briefing on the instant motion to dismiss was complete, Bush filed another motion, \nalternatively styled as a \"motion for consideration \" or a \"motion explicative.\" (D.I. 26) \nAttached to that motion is an email exchange between Bush and a representative of nonparty \nGenmega, Inc. containing references to nonparties \"CDS\" and \"PAI.\" That exchange is \n7 Because Triton seeks dismissal with prejudice , Bush asks the Court \"to sanction defense \ncounsel\" for \"baseless insult and contempt. \" (D.I. 23 at 5) Bush's request for sanctions is \nunfounded and, therefore, denied. \n10 irrelevant to any allegations against Triton , the only named defendant in this case. Moreover, \nbecause the Court is granting Triton's motion to dismiss with prejudice and this case will be \nclosed, the motion is now moot. Accordingl y, the motion is denied. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Triton's motion to dismiss (D.I. 21) is granted, Bush's motion \nfor consideration (D.I. 26) is denied, and the Clerk of Court is directed to close this case. \nDecember 7, 2021 \nWilmington , Delaware \n11 j) ~f ~ \nHON~LE LEONARD P.
