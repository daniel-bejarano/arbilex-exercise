Civil Action No. 19-1011-CFC \nKOLAWOLE AKINBAYO, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE, \nRespondents. \nMEMORANDUM \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn March 31, 1977, a jury convicted [Petitioner] Walter \nStokes, Jr. of intentional first degree murder, first degree \nrobbery, and two counts of possession of a deadly weapon \nduring the commission of a felony [\"PDWDCF\"]. He was \nsentenced to life plus an additional term of years in prison. \nState v. Stokes, 2008 WL 3312809, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 11, 2008). \nOn appeal, [Petitioner] argued, among other things, that \n\"there was insufficient proof of the Corpus delicti to support \nthe convictions for First Degree Robbery and Possession of a \nDeadly Weapon during the robbery\" because the only \nevidence in the record was [Petitioner's] confession. \nThe [Delaware] Supreme Court found that \"there must be \nsome evidence of the Corpus delicti of a crime, independent \nof the defendant's confession to support a conviction.\" Thus, \nthe Supreme Court reversed [Petitioner's] conviction for the \nFirst Degree Robbery and Second PDWDCF. \nOn May 25, 1979, [Petitioner's] sentence was corrected as \nfollows: for First Degree Murder, natural life without benefit of \nparole; for First PDWDCF, 5 years at Level V; for First Degree \n1 Conspiracy, 1 year at Level V; for First Degree Robbery, \nstricken; for Second PDWDCF, stricken. \nState v. Stokes, 2019 WL 6329066, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Nov. 26, 2019). \nIn June 1989, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a motion for post-conviction \nrelief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"). See \nStokes v. State, 574 A.2d 264 (Table), 1990 WL 38314, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 13, \n1990). The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed that decision. See id. at *2. \nIn May 2008, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion. See id. at *1. The \nSuperior Court denied Petitioner's second Rule 61 motion as both time-barred and \nprocedurally barred under Rules 61 (i)(1), (2), and (3). See id. at *3. The Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed that decision. See Stokes v. State, 963 A.2d 139 (Table), 2008 \nWL 5247280, at *1 (Del. Dec. 18, 2008). \nOn May 29, 2018, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a motion for \ncorrection of sentence pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 35(a). (D.I. \n3-1 at 11, Entry No. 69) On October 29, 2018, the Superior Court granted the Rule \n35(a) motion in part, stating: \"The transposition error has been corrected as to CRA \nIN77010848R2, the correction reflects the charge of Robbery 1st, as to CRA \nIN77010847R2, the correction reflects the charge of Conspiracy 1st\u2022 This correction is \nmade in accordance with Superior Court Rule 36 which allows the court to amend \nclerical errors in its records at any time. The correction does not affect the terms of the \npreviously imposed sentence.\" (D.I. 3-1 at 11, Entry No. 73) \n2 Thereafter, Petitioner filed another Rule 35 motion for sentence modification, in \nwhich he argued that his first degree conspiracy sentence is illegal because the \nindictment for the charge was illegal. (D.I. 3-1 at 17) He also argued that the \nconspiracy should have been dismissed because the robbery was included within the \nconspiracy. (D.1. 3-1 at 17 n.9) The Superior Court denied that motion on February 14, \n2019. (D.I. 3-1 at 18) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision on May 9, \n2019, and denied rehearing on May 21, 2019. See Stokes v. State, 210 A.3d 724 \n(Table), 2019 WL 2068320 (Del. May 9, 2019). \nPetitioner filed a third Rule 35 motion for sentence modification, in which he \nargued that \"he was illegally sentenced on May 25, 1979 in violation of Superior Court \nCriminal Rule 32(a)(1 )(C)\" because the \"Court did not allow him the opportunity to be \nheard at his resentencing hearing.\" See State v. Stokes, 2019 WL 6329066, at *1 (Del. \nSuper. Ct. Nov. 26, 2019). The Superior Court denied the third Rule 35 motion, holding \nthat Petitioner had not been illegally sentenced. The Superior Court explained that \nPetitioner \"was present and afforded the opportunity to be heard both personally and \nthrough counsel11 when he was originally sentenced to a mandatory life sentence. Id. at \n*2. The state court further opined that, \"upon remand, the Superior Court had no \ndiscretion in imposing the mandatory life sentence. Therefore, [Petitioner's] rights were \nnot violated when the Superior court issued a written order resentencing him to a \nmandatory life sentence on May 25, 1979.\" Id. at *2. \nOn June 23, 2020, Petitioner filed a fourth motion for correction of illegal \nsentence. See State v. Stokes, 2020 WL 6257035, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 22, \n3 2020), reissued (Del. Super. Ct. July 12, 2021). On July 8, 2020, Petitioner filed a \nmotion to amend sentence pursuant to Rule 35(a), and then filed another motion to \namend on October 5, 2020. See id. In those three motions, Petitioner \"essentially \nargue[d] that because the [Delaware] Supreme Court reversed his First Degree \nRobbery conviction, it was illegal for [the Superior] Court to resentence him to First \nDegree Conspiracy and First Degree Murder.\" Id. at *1. The Superior Court denied the \nthree motions on October 22, 2020. See id. On July 12, 2021, the Superior Court \nvacated the October 22, 2020 decision and reissued it. See id. The Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed the Superior Court's July 12, 2021 decision on October 7, 2021, and \ndenied reargument on November 5, 2021. See Stokes v. State, 263 A.3d 1013 (Table), \n2021 WL 4702602, at *1 (Del. Oct. 7, 2021 ). \nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner's form petition for habeas relief \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and a Memorandum of Law challenging the Delaware state \ncourts' denial of his Rule 35 motions.1 (D.I 1; D.I. 3) He contends that the Delaware \n1The Court's research reveals that Petitioner filed at least two more Rule 35 motions \nafter filing the instant Petition. Those Rule 35 motions appear to have raised similar -if \nnot identical -grounds for relief as did the Rule 35 motions providing the basis for \nPetitioner's instant argument. For instance, Petitioner filed a fourth motion for correction \nof illegal sentence on June 23, 2020. See State v. Stokes, 2020 WL 6257035, at *1 \n(Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 22, 2020), reissued (Del. Super. Ct. July 12, 2021). On July 8, \n2020, Petitioner filed a motion to amend sentence pursuant to Rule 35(a), and then filed \nanother motion to amend on October 5, 2020. See id. In those three motions, \nPetitioner \"essentially argue[d] that because the [Delaware] Supreme Court reversed his \nFirst Degree Robbery conviction, it was illegal for [the Superior] Court to resentence him \nto First Degree Conspiracy and First Degree Murder.\" Id. at *1. The Superior Court \ndenied the three motions on October 22, 2020. See id. On July 12, 2021, the Superior \nCourt vacated the October 22, 2020 decision and reissued it. See id. The Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's July 12, 2021 decision on October 7, \n4 state courts abused their discretion by denying his requests to correct the illegal 1979 \nre-sentence on the first degree conspiracy conviction. (D.I. 3 at 5) More specifically, he \nargues that the Delaware courts abused their discretion in denying his Rule 35 motions \nbecause the 1979 \"re-sentence\": ( 1) exceeds statutory limits; (2) violates double \njeopardy; (3) is ambiguous; (4) is internally contradictory; (5) omits a term required to be \nimposed by statute; (6) is uncertain as to the substance of the sentence; and (7) is a \nsentence that the judgment of conviction did not authorize. (D.I. 3 at 5-8) Petitioner also \nappears to allege that the Delaware Pardon Board improperly refused to grant him a \npardon. (D.I. 3 at 8) In his AEDPA Election Form, Petitioner asserts that he is not \nseeking relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 but, rather, he is seeking relief under \"Fed. \nR. Proc. 35(a)\" which can be filed \"anytime.\" (D.I. 6 at 2) \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA district court judge may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly \nappears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is \nnot entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll.\u00a7 2254. Federal habeas relief is \nunavailable to a state prisoner unless he \"is in custody in violation of the Constitution of \nlaws ... of the United States.\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) and (d). Additionally, \"district \ncourts are permitted, but not obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state \nprisoner's habeas petition.\" Day v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 209 (2006). \nNevertheless, \"before acting on its own initiative [to dismiss a petition as untimely], a \n2021, and denied reargument on November 5, 2021. See Stokes v. State, 263 A.3d \n1013 (Table), 2021 WL 4702602, at *1 (Del. Oct. 7, 2021). \n5 court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.11 \nDay, 547 U.S. at 210. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nThe Court's review of the instant Petitions reveals that it suffers from two flaws. \nFirst, the Petition appears to challenge a state post-conviction decision that cannot be \nremedied by a writ of habeas corpus. Second, to the extent the Petition should be \nconstrued as presenting cognizable habeas claims, the Petition appears to be clearly \ntime-barred. The Court discusses each conclusion in more detail below. \nA. The Petition Does Not Assert Cognizable Habeas Claims \nPetitioner contends that the Delaware state courts abused their discretion in \ndenying his Rule 35(a) motions to correct sentence. (D.1. 3-1 at 46) In Delaware, Rule \n35 motions are motions for collateral review which are judicially reviewed in proceedings \noccurring outside of the direct review process. See Lopez v. Phelps, 2011 WL \n3205488, at *3 n. 5 (D. Del. July 27, 2011). It is well-settled that a claim alleging an \nerror in a state collateral review proceeding is not a cognizable habeas claim. See \nHassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 1998) (\"The federal role in reviewing \nan application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or \nfederal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner's conviction; what occurred in the \npetitioner's collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas calculation.\") \nTherefore, the Court concludes that Petitioner's challenge to the Delaware state court \ndenials of his Rule 35 motions fails to assert a proper basis for federal habeas relief. \n6 Petitioner also appears to contend that the Delaware Board of Pardons \nimproperly denied his request for a pardon. (D.I. 3-1 at 49) It is well settled that an \ninmate has no constitutional or inherent right to the commutation of his sentence. See \nOhio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 280 (1998); Connecticut Bd. of \nPardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458,464 (1981). Therefore, Petitioner's vague \nassertion about his inability to obtain a pardon also fails to assert an issue cognizable \non federal habeas review. See, e.g., Saunders v. Markell, 2013 WL 663407, at *3 (D. \nDel. Feb. 21, 2013) (summarily dismissing as noncognizable a petitioner's challenge to \nthe Governor's denial of a commutation request). \nAs for Petitioner's statement in his AEDPA election form that he wishes to \nproceed under \"Fed. R. Proc. 35\" because an illegal sentence can be corrected \nanytime, the Court notes that Rule 35 only applies to sentences imposed by a federal \ncourt for federal convictions. Petitioner's sentence was imposed by a Delaware state \ncourt for his conviction under Delaware law. Therefore, Federal Rule of Criminal \nProcedure 35 is inapplicable to Petitioner's sentence.2 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(a). \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that the Petition is subject to summary \ndismissal for failing to assert any claims that are cognizable on federal habeas review. \n2Petitioner appears to believe that he can seek relief under Federal Rule of Criminal \nProcedure 35 if he presents his claim on a form petition for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 rather than \non a form for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. (D.I. 4) He is mistaken. Federal Rule of Criminal \nProcedure 35 is inapplicable to state sentences, regardless of the form habeas petition \nutilized by a petitioner. \n7 B. The Petition is Clearly Untimely \nThe Petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. AEDPA imposes a one-year period of limitation on \nthe filing of habeas petitions and effectively precludes petitioners from filing a second or \nsubsequent habeas application except in the most unusual of circumstances. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir. \n1999); Mason v. Meyers, 208 F.3d 414 (3d Cir. 2000). AEDPA's limitation period runs \nfrom the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the \nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for \nseeking time for seeking such review; \n(8) the date on which the impediment to filing an application \ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws \nof the United States is removed, if the applicant was \nprevented from filing by such state action; \n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was \ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been \nnewly recognized by the Supreme Court and made \nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or \nclaims presented could have been discovered through the \nexercise of due diligence. \n28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1 ). When, as here, a petitioner's judgment of conviction became \nfinal prior to AEDPA's effective date of April 24, 1996, the petitioner benefits from a one\u00ad\nyear grace period for timely filing habeas petitions, thereby extending the filing period \n8 through April 23, 1997.1 See McAleese v. Brennan, 483 F.3d 206,213 (3d Cir. 2007); \nDouglas v. Hom, 359 F.3d 257, 261 (3d Cir. 2004). Thus, Petitioner had until April 23, \n1997 to timely file his Petition. \nPetitioner filed the instant Petition in 2019, more than twenty years too late. \nAEDPA's limitations period, however, is subject to statutory and equitable tolling. See \nHolland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) \n(statutory tolling). In addition, a petitioner can avoid being time-barred by establishing a \ngateway claim of actual innocence. The Court will consider whether any of these \ndoctrines affect the timeliness of the instant Petition. \nThe Court views Petitioner's statement in his AEDPA Election Form concerning \nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 as both an acknowledgement that his Petition is \ntime-barred and an attempt to trigger statutory tolling. As previously mentioned, \nhowever, Rule 35 is inapplicable to Petitioner's sentence and does not provide a \nmethod to avoid AEDPA's time bar. In turn, none of Petitioner's state post-conviction \nmotions trigger statutory tolling. Petitioner's first Rule 61 motion, filed in 1993, has no \nstatutory tolling effect because it was filed years before AEDPA's effective date. \n1 Many federal circuit courts have held that the one-year grace period for petitioners \nwhose convictions became final prior to the enactment of AEDPA ends on April 24, \n1997, not April 231 1997. See Patterson v. Stewart, 251 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2001) \n(collecting cases). Although the Third Circuit has noted that \"[a]rguably we should have \nused April 24, 1997, rather than April 23, 1997, as the cut-off date,\" Douglas, 359 F .3d \nat 261 n.5 (citing Fed. R. Civ .P. 6(d)), it appears that April 23, 1997 is still the relevant \ncut-off date in this circuit. In the present situation, however, Petitioner filed his petition \nwell-past either cut-off date, rendering the one-day difference immaterial. \n9 Petitioner's second Rule 61 motion, filed in 2008, also has no statutory tolling effect \nbecause it was filed approximately eleven years after the expiration of AEDPA's \nlimitations period. Finally, none of Petitioner's Rule 35 motions to correct or modify an \nillegal sentence have any statutory tolling effect because they, too, were filed long after \nthe expiration of AEDPA's one-year limitations period. Consequently, the only way for \nthe instant Petition to be deemed timely filed is if equitable tolling applies or if Petitioner \nestablishes a gateway claim of actual innocence. \nEquitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the petitioner \ndemonstrates \"(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some \nextraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\" Holland, 560 \nU.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available \nwhere the late filing is due to the petitioner's excusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. As for \nthe extraordinary circumstance requirement, \"the relevant inquiry is not whether the \ncircumstance alleged to be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an \nobstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA's one-year deadline.\" Pabon v. \nMahanoy, 654 F .3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011 ). An extraordinary circumstance will only \nwarrant equitable tolling if there is \"a causal connection, or nexus, between the \nextraordinary circumstance[] and the petitioner's failure to file a timely federal petition.\" \nRoss v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). Specifically, \"if the person seeking \nequitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the \nextraordinary circumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary \ncircumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances \n10 therefore did not prevent timely filing.\" Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768, 773 (3d \nCir.2003). The burden is on the petitioner to prove that he has been reasonably diligent \nin pursuing his rights. See Urcinoli v. Cathe/, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir.2008). \nIn addition, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \"equitable \nexception\" that can overcome the bar of AEDPA's one-year limitations period. See \nMcQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4th at 150-151. A \npetitioner satisfies the actual innocence exception by (1) presenting new, reliable \nevidence of his innocence; and (2) showing \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that \n\"a reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new \nevidence.\" Wallace, 2 F.4th at 151. Evidence is new for purposes of the actual \ninnocence gateway, even if it was available for trial counsel through reasonable \ndiligence, if trial counsel's failure to discover or present it is alleged as ineffective \nassistance of counsel. See Reeves v. Fayette SCI, 897 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2018). \nPetitioner does not provide any argument for equitable tolling or actual \ninnocence. Given these circumstances, the Court finds that the instant Petition is \nsubject to summary dismissal for being time-barred. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that the instant Petition is \nsubject to summary dismissal. Nevertheless, in the interests of justice, Petitioner shall \nbe given an opportunity to show cause: (1) why his Petition should not dismissed for \nfailing to assert any claim cognizable on federal habeas review; and (2) why the Petition \n11 should not be dismissed as time-barred. If Petitioner fails to respond, his Petition will be \nsummarily dismissed with prejudice.
