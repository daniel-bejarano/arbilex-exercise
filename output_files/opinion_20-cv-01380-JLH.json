No. 20- 1380- JLH \n      \n \nMEMORANDUM O RDER \nPlaintiff Sharon Ann Macey appeals from a n unfavorable  decision of the Commissioner of  \nthe Social  Security  Administration1 denying her  application for disability  insurance benefits  \n(\u201cDIB\u201d) .  This Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).  The parties have consented to \nentry of final judgment by the United States Magistrate Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).   \nThe parties filed cross -motions for summary judgment.  (D.I. 15, 19.)  For the reasons \nannounced from the bench on October 29, 2021, the C ourt finds  that the d ecision of the \nCommissioner is supported by substantial evidence and that there are no reversible errors . \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nCourts review the Commissioner \u2019s factual findings for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 405(g).  Substantial evidence  \u201cmeans \u2014and me ans only\u2014\u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d  Biestek v. Berryhill , 139 S. Ct. 1148, \n1154 (2019)  (quoting Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)) .  In reviewing \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Kilolo Kij akazi \nwas autom atically substituted for former Commissioner of Social Security Andrew Saul when she \nsucceeded him on July 9, 2021.  2 \n whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner \u2019s findings, courts  may not \u201cre -weigh the \nevidence or impose their own factual determinations.\u201d  Chandler v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d \n356, 359 (3d Cir. 2011) ; see also  Zirsnak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 610\u201311 (3d Cir. 2014) .  In other \nwords, r eviewing courts must affirm the Commissioner if substantial evidence supports the \nCommissioner \u2019s decision, even if they would have decided the case differently.   \nTo determine if a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner  follows a five -step sequential \ninquiry.  See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i) \u2013(v).  The Third Circuit has previously explained this \nsequential analysis , and the shifting burdens that attend each step, in detail: \nThe first two steps involve threshold determina tions.  In step \none, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant \ncurrently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.  If a claimant is found to be engaging in substantial gainful activity, the disability claim will be denied.  In step two, the Commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.  If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the disability claim is denied.  In step three, the Commissi oner compares the medical \nevidence of the claimant \u2019s impairment to a list of impairments \npresumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.  If the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.  If a claimant does not suffer \nfrom a listed impairment or its equivalent, the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.  Step four requires the ALJ to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work .  The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating \nan inability to return to his past relevant work.  If the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied. \n If the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation, \nthe evaluation moves to the final  step.  At this stage, the burden of \nproduction shifts to the Commissioner, who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.  The Commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy \nwhich the claimant can perform, consistent with his or her medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity.  The ALJ must analyze the cumulative effect of 3 \n all the clai mant \u2019s impairments in determining whether he is capable \nof performing work and is not disabled. \n \nNewell v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 347 F.3d 541, 545 \u201346 (3d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nThe analysis is identical whether an application seeks  disability insurance benefits  or supplemental \nsecurity income.  McCrea v. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 370 F.3d 357, 360 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nThe decision of the Court was announced from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing \nas follows:  \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied and the \nCommissioner\u2019s cross -motion for summary judgment will be \ngranted.  \n \nPlaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to appropriately consider \nthe results of a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) performed by Carina Rodriguez, MS, PT, which resulted in a residual functional \ncapacity (RFC) that improperly failed to include any sitting limitations or a sit/stand option.   Ms. Rodriguez opined that P laintiff \ncould walk ten  to fifteen  minutes and sit up to sixty  minu tes with \nfrequent shifting of her weight from side to side and that she would need to recline occasionally and change positions from sitting to standing every thirty  minutes.\n2  The ALJ discredited Ms. \nRodriguez \u2019s opinion and did not include the sitting li mitations or a \nsit/stand option in the RFC.   \n I find no error in the ALJ \u2019s consideration or treatment of Ms. \nRodriguez \u2019s FCE opinion.  First, it is clear from the ALJ \u2019s decision \nthat she did not ignore the conclusions in the FCE.  Rather, she simply did not credit them.  And she explained that she did not credit Ms. Rodriguez \u2019s opinion because she found that it was not \nsupported by a detailed explanation as to how the objective data \nnecessitated such restrictive limitations and that such limitations \nwere i nconsistent with the evidence.   \n  \nSecond, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ \u2019s \ndecision not to adopt the restrictive limitations from the FCE into \nthe RFC.\n  For example, the ALJ considered that the FCE itself \n\u201crevealed a mostly normal cervical spine and some greater pain with \n \n2 (Transcript of Social Security Proceedings , D.I. 11\u201312 (\u201cRecord\u201d or \u201cR.\u201d) , at 710.)  \n 4 \n range of motion of the lumbar spine but within normal strength, \nrange of motion, sensation in the upper and lower extremities, tandem walk and gait. \u201d\n3 \n The ALJ also credited the December 2017 opinion of Dr. \nIrwin Lifrak , M.D., following a consultative examination.\n4  Dr. \nLifrak  opined that the claimant could sit for up to six hours and stand \nfor four to six hours in an eight -hour workday without use of an \nassistive device.5   \n The ALJ also credited the opinions of state agency medical \nconsultants in prior administrative finding s.  These consultants \nopined that P laintiff could stand/walk for four hours and sit for six \nhours.\n6  The ALJ found these opinions persuasive because they were \nwell supported with explanation and were consistent with the evidentiary record.   \n The ALJ also  noted that Plaintiff reported to Ms. Rodriguez \nthat she stopped working in 2018 so she could care for her sick husband.  And the ALJ further considered that Plaintiff \u2019s activities \nof daily living included caring for her husband and grandson and that Plain tiff stated in her self -reported activity questionnaire that \nshe was walking and/or standing for eleven  hours per day and sitting \nor reclining for seven  hours .\n7 \n Plaintiff points out that Ms. Rodriguez \u2019s FCE assessment is \ncorroborated by the opinions of Plaintiff \u2019s treating neurosurgeon, \nDr. Boulos, from 2018 and 2019.\n8  In 2018, Dr. Boulos opined that \nPlaintiff could only sit for twenty  to thirty  minutes at one time and \nup to three hours in total during an eight -hour workday.  He also \nopined that she could only stand for up to ten  minutes at a time, \n \n3 (R. at 18, 708\u201310.)  \n \n4 (R. at 16\u201317.)  \n \n5 (R. at 587\u201388.)   \n  \n6 (R. at 18, 86, 101\u201302.)  \n  \n7 (R. at 15\u201317, 50\u201351,  710.)  See Muschko v. Comm \u2019r Soc. Sec., No. 20- 2771, 2021 WL \n3666638, at *3 (3d Cir. Aug. 18, 2021); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i)  (stating the agency will \nconsider claimant \u2019s daily activities in evaluating subjective complaints ). \n \n8 (R. at 17.)  \n 5 \n would need to alternate between sitting and standing at will, and \ncould remain at a workstation for up to four  hours.9 In 2019, Dr. \nBoulos \u2019s opinion contained similar limitations but with a furth er \nreduction in standing/walking and sitting/standing.10  \n \nHowever, the ALJ did not find these opinions persuasive \nbecause Dr. Boulos provided no explanation in the 2018 opinion and \nlittle explanation in the 2019 opinion supporting such restrictive limitations , and the limitations were inconsistent with the evidence \nin the medical record.\n11 Dr. Boulos \u2019s reports refer red to no objective \nevidence supporting the limitations argued by P laintiff, such as \nmedical tests or reports , or other evidence , such as [ Plaintiff ]\u2019s own \nreported symptoms or pain.  Moreover, Dr. Boulos \u2019s own records \nindicate each of P laintiff \u2019s surgeries performed by him went well \nand that P laintiff was recovering well.   \n  In sum, the ALJ explained why she dis counted Ms. \nRodriguez and Dr. Boulos \u2019s opinions and her decision to do so was \nconsistent with current [Social Security Administration] ( SSA) \nregulations, which provide that the most important factors to be considered when weighing or deciding to credit medical opinions are supportability and consistency.\n12   \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ \u2019s decision cherry -picked \nevidence from the record to support her conclusions.   I disagree.   The ALJ \u2019s decision summarized the evidence chronologically and \nthoroughly and properly indicated which of the opinions the ALJ \nrejected and the reason(s) why.\n13 \n In sum, I conclude that the ALJ did not commit error in her \nconsideration of the FCE and that the ALJ \u2019s RFC determination was \nsupported by substantial evidence.  \n \n \n9 (R. at 592\u201393.)  \n  \n10 (R. at 701\u201302, 772\u201374.)  \n \n11 (R. at 17.)  \n \n12 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c. \n \n13 See Cotter v. Harris , 642 F.2d 700, 705 (3d Cir. 1981). 6 \n III. CONCLUSI ON \nPlaintiff \u2019s motion for summary judgment  (D.I. 15) is DENIED and Defendant \u2019s motion for \nsummary judgment (D.I. 1 9) is GRANTED.  \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendant and to CLOSE the \ncase.  \n \nDated: December  27, 2021   ______________________________ \n      The Honorable Jennifer L. Hall \n      UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n"}
