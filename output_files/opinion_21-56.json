(D.I. 16) The \nCourt has reviewed the parties' briefs and other submissions . (See, e.g., D.I. 17-20) For the \nreasons set forth below, the Court will deny Defendants ' motion to dismiss. \nI. BACKGROUND \nNatera filed its complaint in this case on January 20, 2021, alleging that Defendants have \ninfringed U.S. Patent Nos. 10,262,755 (the '\"755 patent\") and 10,597,709 (the \"'709 patent\"). \n(D.I. 111; see also D.I. 1311) The '755 patent claims \"methods for detecting genetic \nmutations, including aneuploid y, in tumor DNA.\" (D.I. 13128) The '709 patent claims \n\"methods for simultaneously amplifying multiple nucleic acid regions of interest in a reaction \nmixture.\" (Id. 130) The complaint alleges that Defendants have ''unlawfully used Natera's \npatented technology , including in connection with Inivata's In VisionFirst-Lung cancer \ndiagnostic test ('InVisionFirst-Lung ') and any other products that use the same or similar \ntechnology .\" (Id. 1 13) \nDefendants initially moved to dismiss in April 2021 (D.I. 10), to which Natera responded \nby filing the first amended complaint in May 2021 (D .I. 13 ). On June 1, 2021, Defendants filed \nthe pending motion to dismiss. (D.I. 16) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 6) requires \nthe Court to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 \nF .3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004 ). \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but \n1 whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThus, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss only if, after \"accepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F .3d 4 72, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nHowever, \"[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227,234 (3d Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible \n\"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). At bottom, \"[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation \nthat discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\" of a plaintiffs claim. \nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter School Inc., 522 F.3d 315,321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \"bald assertions ,\" Morse v. Lower Merion \nSch. Dist., 132 F .3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \"unsupported \nconclusions and unwarranted inferences ,\" Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co., \n113 F.3d 405,417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \"self-evidently false,\" Nami v. Fauver, \n82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996). \n2 III. DISCUSSION \nA. '755 Patent \nDefendants first contend that Natera fails to plausibly allege that the accused products \nperform the claim limitation \"amplifying at least 1000 polymorphic loci relating to cancer\u00ad\nassociated aneuploidy. \" ('755 patent at 197:37-38) Natera alleges that the accused assay, as \ndescribed in Defendants' Gale publication , targets \"hotspots and entire coding regions\" from 35 \ngenes, for amplification and analysis, including four genes tested for copy number variants \n(\"CNVs\"), a cancer-associated aneuploid y. (D.I. 13 Ex. 3 at 14) Natera alleges the \"entire \ncoding regions\" of the four genes contain more than 1000 polymorphic loci and, in this way, the \nclaim limitation is satisfied. (See id. at 19-21) Defendants insist that Natera has \"misinterpreted \nthe Gale publication ,\" which, in Defendants ' view, discloses that only \"hotspots\" -but not \n\"entire coding regions\" -are amplified for the genes tested for CNVs. (See D.I. 17 at 5-8) In \nthe present procedural posture, the Court will not dismiss a patent infringement claim based on \nDefendants' contested reading of the Gale publication. (See generally D.I. 18 at 7-13) At this \nearly stage, it appears that both parties are able to identify disclosures in the Gale publication \n( and the accompanying supplemental materials) that plausibly support their competing \ninferences. (See D.I. 17 at 6-7; D.I. 18 at 8-13; D.I. 19 at 2-6) In evaluating the pending motion \nto dismiss, the Court must resolve competing inferences in Natera's favor. See In re Bill of \nLading Transmission & Processing Sys. Patent Litig., 681 F.3d 1323, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2012).1 \n1 Despite their contentions, Defendants have not identified \"irreconcilable internal \ninconsistencies\" in the first amended complaint. (D.I. 17 at 7) Nor does the first amended \ncomplaint \"affirmatively show no infringement. \" (Id.) \n3 Defendants next contend that Natera fails to plausibly allege that the accused products \nperform the claim limitation of \"using the nucleic acid sequence data to generate phased allelic \ndata.\" ('755 patent at 197:45-46) Relying on Defendants ' Forshew and Gale publications , the \nfirst amended complaint alleges that the accused products \"use the nucleic acid sequence data to \ngenerate phased allelic data for the set of polymorphic loci on each of the plurality of \nchromosomes or chromosome segment.\" (D.I. 13 Ex. 3 at 22, 25) Defendants counter that the \nterms \"phasing\" and \"phasing data\" require \"determining the 'haplotype ' for an individual ,\" and \nthat the publications Natera relies upon have \"nothing to do with the claim limitation at issue.\" \n(D.I. 17 at 8) This contention implicates a claim construction dispute, which the Court will not \nresolve in connection with a motion to dismiss. See Nalco Co. v. Chem-Mod LLC, 883 F.3d \n1337, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2018); see also D.I. 18 at 13-16) Additionally , whether the assay \ndescribed in the Forshew and Gale publications performs this claim limitation under Defendants ' \nconstruction presents an issue of fact. Defendants ' argument , thus, does not provide a basis for \ndismissing Natera's infringement claim. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Defendant s' motion to dismiss the claims that their \naccused products infringe the '755 patent. \nB. '709 Patent \nDefendants contend that the first amended complaint fails to plausibly allege that the \naccused products perform the claim limitation requiring amplifying \"at least 50 target loci.\" \n('709 patent at 237:39-40) For this contention , Defendants point to the figure that Natera relies \non for its infringement allegations , which discloses \"markers from 37 genes,\" arguing that \n\"Natera's extrapolation of 37 genes into over 50 loci, as the claims recite, is unfounded. \" (D.I. \n17 at 11-12) The first amended complaint alleges that \"[e]ach of the 37 genes analyzed in the \n4 Accused Products comprises hundreds to thousands of variants ... , the accused products \namplify at least 50 of these variants as target loci.\" (D.I. 13 Ex. 4 at 4) At this stage, the Court \nhas no basis not to credit as plausible the allegation that these 37 genes may plausibly comprise \nover 50 target loci. \nDefendants also contend that Natera's reliance on the Forshew publication, to allege that \nthe \"melting temperature\" limitation of the '709 patent is met, renders the '709 patent \n\"necessarily invalid since the Forshew publication predates the '709 patent's earliest possible \npriority date.\" (D.I. 17 at 13) A patent is invalid as anticipated if \"a single prior art reference \ndiscloses each and every limitation of the claimed invention. \" Schering Corp. v. Geneva \nPharms., Inc., 339 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Natera's first amended complaint does not \nallege that the Forshew publication discloses each and every limitation of the method claimed in \nthe '709 patent. Nor does the allegation that the accused products utilize the eTam-Seq method \nthat was \"described\" in the Forshew publication necessarily indicate that the Forshew publication \ndiscloses each and every limitation of the method claimed in the '709 patent. (See D.I. 18 at 18-\n19) Defendants' invalidity theory may be the subject of evidentiary proceedings as this case \nmoves forward but it does not provide a meritorious basis on which to dismiss Natera's claims of \ninfringement. 2 \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Defendants ' motion to dismiss the claims that their \naccused products infringe the '709 patent. \n2 Defendants' indefiniteness-related and claim construction arguments (see, e.g., D.I. 17 at 2) \nlikewise provide no basis for the relief they seek in their motion. (See also C.A. No. 20-125 D.I. \n243 at 10-12) (rejecting, in related litigation, indefiniteness argument) \n5 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Defendants ' motion to dismiss (D.I. 16). \nAn appropriate order follows. \n6 NATERA, INC., \nV.
