BACKGROUND \nAs any one with a cell phone knows, spam or otherwise random and unwanted calls are no \nrare occurrence.   To the general public, these calls are a nuisance, but to many commercial entities \nthat rely on telephonic communic ation to interact with customers, these calls pose a costly \nproblem.  When a company\u2019s agent  picks up a spam call, the company is paying that  agent to deal \nwith nonsense while other legitimate  callers  are left on hold.  Worse yet, behind many spam calls \nare fraudsters seeking to obtain sensitive information or money, thereby threatening the company \nand their customers.  \nPlaintiff and Defendant are two companies that provide anti -spoofing and caller -\nauthenti cation solutions to help companies solve these complex challenges.   Plaintiff has obtained \nseveral patents that cover its solution for dealing with the  problem s.  According to Plaintiff , its \npatented technology works by \u201cperform[ing] a real -time telephone forensic analysis before a call \nis answered . . . allow[ing] call centers to quickly identify callers that should enter trusted work \nflows for better, faster service.\u201d  (D.I. 16 \u00b6 11).  Defendant, which markets a product called \nVeriCall, has not sought to patent its technology, opting instead to keep it a trade secret. \n \n1  Each party filed a singular post -trial motion but moved for relief on multiple grounds.  The \nCourt treats each ground as a separate motion.  \n  \n2 (Tr. 293: 17\u201325) .2  VeriCall  works by first answering the call at a call center, initiating an \ninteractive voice system (\u201cIVR\u201d) ,3 transf erring the call to VeriCall so that VeriCall can perfo rm \nits analysis, and then returning the call to the IVR, which may or may not transfer the call to the \nagent  according to the result of  VeriCall\u2019s analysis.   (Tr. 1047: 22\u20131048:8) .  \nPlaintiff sued Defend ant, alleging that VeriCall infringes claims 1, 4, and 10 of U.S. Patent \nNo. 9,001,985 (\u201cthe \u2019985 patent\u201d)  and claims 32, 48, and 50 of U.S. Patent No. 8,238,532 (\u201cthe \n\u2019532 patent\u201d) , and that its customers infringe claims 1, 14, and 15 of the U.S. Patent N o. 9,871,913 \n(\u201cthe \u2019913 pat ent\u201d) .  At trial, Defendant  denied infringement and challenged the validity  of the \nasserted claims .  Specifically, Defendant  argued that the asserted claims of the \u2019532 and \u2019913 \npatents are invalid for anticipation and obviousnes s based on the prior art4 and that all of the \nasserted claims a re patent ineligible.5  After trial, the jury found all asserted claims valid but not \ninfringed.  ( See D.I. 297).   \nPlaintiff  also sued Defendant for violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, and the \nDelaware Unif orm Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\u201cDTPA\u201d), 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2532, for several  \nstatements Defendant made in marketing VeriCall  \u2013 i.e., that VeriCall will \u201cincrease 10% IVR \n \n2  \u201cTr.\u201d refers to the trial transcript.  \n \n3 IVR systems are automated systems used to handle inquirie s without the help of an agent.  \n \n4  Prior to trial, the PTAB had found claims 1 and 4 of the\u2019985 patent to be unpatentable and \nclaim 10 to be patentable.  Thus, the Court determined that Next Caller was  estopped from \nasserting certain anticipation and obvi ousness defenses as to those claims at trial.  After \ntrial, the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB\u2019s decision that claims 1 and 4 are unpatentable and vacated the PTAB\u2019s non- obviousness determination and remanded for further \nproceedings on claim 10.  TRUSTI D, Inc. v. Next Caller, Inc. , 2021 WL 4427918 (Fed. Cir. \nSept. 27, 2021) . \n \n5  The jury was asked whether each of the asserted claims involve s only activities that were \nwell-understood, routine, and conventional .  \n3 Containment Rate\u201d6 and that VeriCall performs its analysis pre -answer.   The jury found that \nDefendant was not liable under  either  statute for the statements it made about performing its \nanalysis pre -answer.  The jury , however, found Defendant liable for its \u201c10% IVR\u201d statement \nunder the Lanham Act ( but not the DTPA ).  The jury then awarded Plaintiff $1.44 million in \ncompensatory damages and an additional $1.44 million in punitive damages.   \nBoth parties filed post -trial motions that are now before the Court.  Plaintiff renewed its \nmotion for  judgment as a matter of law on infringement of the \u2019532 and \u2019985 patent, and for a new \ntrial on willful infringement and damages on those two patents.  Plaintiff further moved for \njudgment as a ma tter of law under the DTPA and asked the Court to award pre -judgment and post -\njudgement interest on the jury\u2019s damages award.  (D.I. 317).  Defendant renewed its motion for \njudgment as a matter of law of no false advertising under the Lanham Act and furthe r moved the \nCourt to take away the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages.  (D.I. 315).  The C ourt addresses the \nmotion s below . \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Judgment as a Matter of Law  \nJudgment as a matter of law may be entered against a non -moving party if the Court \u201cfinds \nthat a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on [an] issue.\u201d  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1).  Judgment as a matter of  law is appropriate \u201conly if, viewing \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insuff icient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find \n \n6  IVR containment refers to th e IVR system \u2019s ability  to handle the entirety of a caller\u2019s \ninquiry without the help of a human agent.  Increasing IVR containment is a valuable cost -\nsaving tool for entities because the IVR system\u2019s ability to wholly satisfy a caller reduces \nthe need for expensive hum an agents  to handle the caller\u2019s inquiry.   \n4 liability.\u201d  Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993).  Entry of \njudgment as a matter of law is a remedy to be invoked only \u201csparingly.\u201d  CGB Occupational \nTherapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs. Inc., 357 F.3d 375, 383 (3d Cir. 2004). \nFollowing a jury t rial, a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) \nmay be granted only if the movant demonstrates \u201cthat the jury\u2019s findings, presumed or express, are not supported by substantial evidence or, if they were, that the legal conclusion(s) implied [by] the jury\u2019s verdict cannot in law be supported by those findings.\u201d  Pannu v. Iolab Corp., 155 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (alteration in original) (internal quota tion marks omitted).  Substantial \nevidence is such relevant evidence that a r easonable mind might accept as adequate to support the \nfinding under review.  See Enplas Display Device Corp. v. Seoul Semiconductor Co., 909 F.3d \n398, 407 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  In determining whether substantial evidence supports the jury verdict, the Court may not make credibility determinations, weigh the evidence or substitute its own conclusions for that of the jury where the record evidence supports multiple inferences.  \nSee Lig htning Lube , 4 F.3d at 1166.  Moreover, in the Third Circuit, when the movant  bears the \nburden of proof on an issue, judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if \u201cthere is insufficient evidence for permitting any different finding.\u201d  Fireman\u2019s Fund I ns. Co. v. Videfreeze Corp., \n540 F.2d 1171, 1177 (3d Cir. 1976) (quoting 9 W\nIGMORE ON EVIDENCE  \u00a7 2495 at 306 (3d ed. \n1940)); see also  Amgen Inc. v. Hospira, Inc., 944 F.3d 1327, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  \nB. Motion for a New Trial  \n\u201cA new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues in an \naction in whi ch there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new trials have \nheretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States.\u201d  F ED. R. CIV. P. 59(a).  \nCommon reasons for granting a new trial are:  (1) the jury\u2019s verdict  is against the clear weight of  \n5 the evidence and a new trial is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice; (2) there exists newly \ndiscovered evidence that would likely alter t he outcome of the trial; (3) improper conduct by an \nattorney or the Court unf airly influenced the verdict; or (4) the jury\u2019s verdict was facially \ninconsistent.  See Ateliers de la Haute -Garonne v. Broetje Automation- USA Inc. , 85 F. Supp. 3d \n768, 775 (D. De l. 2015).   \nThe decision of whether to grant a new trial is a question commit ted to the Court\u2019s \ndiscretion.  See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., 449 U.S. 33, 36 (1980).  Unlike the standard for judgment as a matter of law, the Court need not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner when ruling on a m otion for a new trial.  See Ateliers , 85 F. Supp. 3d at 775.  \n\u201c[N]ew trials because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence are proper only when the record shows that the jury\u2019s verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice or where the verdict, o n the \nrecord, cries out to be overturned or shocks [the] conscience.\u201d  Williamson v. Consol. Rail Corp., 926 F.2d 1344, 1353 (3d Cir. 1991). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Patent Infringement  \nThe jury found that Plaintiff did not prove that Defendant directly infringed any of the \nasserted claims of the patents -in-suit.  (D.I. 297 at 1).  TRUSTID moves the court to enter judgment \nas a matter of law on infringement of the \u2019532 and \u2019985 patents , and f or a new trial on willful \ninfringement and damages for those  patent s.  (D.I. 317).   \n1.  The Jury Could Have Found No Infringement of t he Asserted \nClaims of the  \u2019532 Patent  Based on Evidence That VeriCall Is Not \na \u201cSystem\u201d Comprising \u201cMemory\u201d and \u201cProcessors\u201d   \nAll asserted claims of the \u2019532 patent require a \u201csystem\u201d comprising \u201cmemory\u201d and \n\u201cprocessors \u201d (among other things) .  To \u201cuse\u201d a system in a manner that constitutes direct \ninfringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a), one must control and benefit from each cla imed component  \n6 of that system.  Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility LLC , 870 F.3d 1320, 1329 (Fed. \nCir. 2 017).  W hether VeriCall constituted such a system was contested at trial b ased on the fact \nthat VeriCall relies on A mazon Web Services (\u201cA WS\u201d) code, memory, and processers  to perform \nsome of the functions recited in the a sserted c laims of the \u2019532 patent.   \nPlaintiff argues that Defendant\u2019s use of AWS\u2019s  \u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cprocessors\u201d is direct \ninfringement as a matter of law because Defendant con trols and benefits from AWS\u2019s \u201cmemory\u201d \nand \u201cprocessors.\u201d  (D.I. 318 at 14).  In support , Plaintiff points to testimony  from Defendant\u2019s \nexpert, who testified  that Defendant \u201cessentially leas[es] processors from Amazon Web Services\u201d \nand that VeriCall would not work without those memory and processors.  (Tr. at 792:9\u201322, \n793:25\u2013794:15) .  In Plaintiff\u2019s eyes, Defendant\u2019s con cession that it leases AWS memory and \nprocessors is sufficient to establish \u201ccontrol,\u201d and Defendant\u2019s admission  that VeriCall would not \nwork without  AWS \u2019s memory and processors establishes th at Defendant \u201cbenefits\u201d from those  \nmemory and processors.  \nAt trial, Defendant argued that VeriCall is itself a component of a larger system that would \nnot work without other components that it does not control.  The jury heard evidence that VeriCall \nis a \u201ccloud- based solution\u201d that is \u201chosted on Amazon.\u201d  ( Tr. 307:8\u20139) .  Defendant also introduced \nevidence that VeriCall relies on machine learning code that belongs to Amazon and runs on \nAmazon\u2019s processor.   (Tr. 734:15\u201317) .  The jury additionally  heard from three of VeriCall\u2019s \ncustomers that VeriCall  is not itself a stand -alone system  and consequently had to be integrated \nwith the customers\u2019 systems in order to function properly.  (Tr. 372:5\u20139; Tr. 398:8\u201311; Tr. 414:25\u2013 \n415:2) .  Further , Defendant\u2019s expert , Dr. Brody, testified that VeriCall is not a system at all, that \nit lacks many of the components of the system described in the asserted claims of the \u2019532 patent  \nand it relies on components that Defendant  does not use and control.  (Tr. 734:7\u201320).    \n7 Thus, i n arguing infringement of the \u2019532 patent  to the jury, the parties presented differing \naccounts of what VeriCall is and what Defendant \u201ccontrols\u201d and \u201cbenefits \u201d from.   The jury \nreceived substantial evidence that VeriCall is but a piece of a puzzle that works in conjunction \nwith other pieces that De fendant does not \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cbenefit\u201d from.  The jury was entitled to \ncredit Defendant\u2019s evidence over that put forth by Plaintiff, and therefore the Court m ust deny \njudgment as a matter of law on infringement of t he asserted claims of the \u2019532 patent. \n2. The Jury Could Have Found No Infringement of the Asserted \nClaims of the \u2019 985 Patent  Based on Evidence that VeriCall is Not \n\u201cAssociated With\u201d Customers\u2019 Systems      \nThrough its dependency on claims 1 and 8, c laim 10 of  the \u2019985 patent  claims :7 \n1. A method of determining a source origin confidence metric of a calling party \nnumber or billing number associated with an incoming call to a called party \ntelephonic device  from a calling party telephonic device, comprising:  \n \nreceiving by an electronic system associated with the called party telephonic \ndevice the calling party number or billing number, wherein the electronic \nsystem  receives the calling party number or billing number from  the called \nparty telephonic device:  \n \nafter receiving the calling party number or billing number  and before the \nincoming call is answered, gathering by the electronic system associated \nwith the called party  telephonic device operational status  information \nassociated with the calling party number or  billing number, and  \n determining by the electronic system associated with the  called party \ntelephonic device the Source origin confidence metric for the calling party \nnumber or billing number. \n \n8. The method of claim 1, further comprising:  \n \nadjusting by the system associated with the called party telephonic device \nthe source origin confidence metric  based on personal risk factors of an \nentity associated  with the calling party number or billing number. \n \n \n7  As noted above, after trial, the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB\u2019s decision that claims 1 and 4 are unpatentable and remanded the case back to PTAB to reconsider whether claim 10 is obvious.  Thus, the Court only cons iders Plaintiff\u2019s judgment as a matter of law with \nrespect to claim 10 of the \u2019985 patent.   \n8 10. The method of claim 8, further compr ising:  \n \nretrieving consortium information by the system associated with the called \nparty telephonic device from an external database.  \n \nClaim 10 , thus, requires an electronic system to be \u201cassociated with\u201d the call ed party\u2019s \ntelephonic devices.  \u201cAssociated with\u201d was not a term that the parties sought to have c onstrued.  \n(See D.I. 138; D.I. 282).  The jury was therefore entitled to give the phrase its plain and or dinary \nmeaning.  See Comcast IP Holdings I LLC v. Spr int Commc'ns Co., L.P., 850 F.3d 1302, 1311\u201312  \n(Fed. Cir. 2017) ; ePlus, Inc. v. Lawson Software, Inc., 700 F.3d 509, 520 (Fed. Cir. 2012)  (\u201cIn the \nabsence of such a construction, however, the jury was f ree to rely on the plain and ordinary \nmeaning of the term . . .\u201d).    \n Plaintiff argues that no reasonable jury could have found that VeriCall is not \u201cassociated \nwith\u201d Defendant\u2019s  customers because evidence at trial demonstrated  that each customer had to \nmodify its system to connect to and use VeriCall.   Specifically, Plaintiff points to evidence in the \nrecord where Defendant\u2019s infringement expert agrees that customers must modify their systems \nby adding programming to make VeriCall function.  ( Tr. 784:21\u2013785:1; Tr. 785:15\u201322) .  Plaintiff \nalso cites  evidence s uggesting that VeriCall is working for each customer, thus demonstrating that \nthose customers have modified  their respective systems to use VeriCall.  ( Tr. 373:20\u201323; \nTr. 397:16\u201318; Tr. 409:5\u20138; Tr. 418:13\u201316) .    \nThat, however, is not the only evidence pr esented to the jury.  Defendant disputed that \nVeriCall is \u201cassociated with\u201d its customers\u2019 systems  by analogizing VeriCall\u2019s relationship to \ncustomers\u2019 systems with the Amazon.com consumer\u2019s relationship to Amazon\u2019s systems.  \n(Tr. 714:10\u201318; Tr. 715:11\u2013716:11; Tr. 734:21\u2013735:10) .  This testimony suggested that the fact \nthat two computers are in contact does not make them \u201cassociated with\u201d each other  and t he jury  \n9 may have found this argument persuasive .8  In short, t he jury heard evidence of how Defendant\u2019s \nproduct works and testimony on how that product does (or does not ) satisfy the \u201cassociated with\u201d \nlimitation of the claim.  The jury had a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to believe Defendant\u2019s \narguments and Plaintiff\u2019s motion with respect to claim 10 of the  \u2019985 patent is denied .  \n3. The Jury Also Could Have Found No Infringement of the Asserted \nClaims  of the \u2019532 or \u2019985 Patents Because of Evidence Supporting \nReject ion of TRUSTID\u2019s  \u201cSecon d Call\u201d Theory     \nThe asserted claims of the  \u2019532 and \u2019985 patents require that certain activities occur \u201cbefore \nthe incoming call is answered.\u201d   Both the terms \u201ccall\u201d and \u201cis answered\u201d were construed.9  \u201cCall\u201d \nwas constru ed to mean \u201cany connection over a telecommunications or an information service \nnetwork and includes, but is not limited to, landline, wireless, modem, facsimile, Session Initiation \nProtocol (SIP), and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transmissions\u201d and \u201cis  answered\u201d was \nconstrued to mean \u201cactually or virtually goes off hook.\u201d  (D.I. 137, D.I. 282).   \nAt trial, the jury heard competing evidence about whether the VeriCall product met the \n\u201ccall\u201d and \u201cis answered\u201d elements of the claims.  Plaintiff\u2019s expert tes tified that VeriCall infringes \nthe asserted claims because it performs the required activities bef ore the \u201ccall\u201d to the human agent \n\u201cis answered\u201d \u2013 even if those activities happen after the call to the IVR system.  ( Tr. 582:13\u201322; \nTr. 589:13\u2013590:10) .  Defe ndant  presented contrary evidence, with its expert testifying that once \nthe call is answered by th e IVR system, it is no longer an \u201cincoming\u201d call, and because the activities \n \n8  \u201c[W]here the parties and the district court elect to provide the jury only with the claim \nlanguage itself, and do not provide an interpretation of the la nguage in the light of the \nspecification and the prosecution history, it is too late at the JMOL stage to argue for or adopt a new and more detailed interpretation of the claim language and test the jury verdict by that new and more detailed interpretation.  The ve rdict must be tested by the charge \nactually given and by giving the ordinary meaning of the language of the jury instruction.\u201d  Hewlett -Packard Co. v. Mustek Sys., Inc ., 340 F.3d 1314, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \n \n9  Then Chief Judge Stark construed the terms p rior to the case being reassigned to this judge.   \n10 required for infringement occur after the call is answered by the IVR system, the re can be no \ninfringement.  ( Tr. 691:7 \u201310; Tr. 692:5\u20139) .  The jury also saw marketing materials su ggesting that \n\u201cNext Caller\u2019s processing occurs after a call is answered.\u201d  ( JTX-040).  In the face of this \nconflicting evidence about whether the claim terms,  as construed, were met by the accused \nVeriCall, the jury was free to credit the evidence presented that the \u201ccall\u201d was no longer an \n\u201cincoming call\u201d once it was answered by the IVR.  For this separate and independently sufficient reason, the Court denies  Plaintiff\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law on infringement of all \nasserted claims of the \u2019 532 and \u2019985 patents.  \n4. Willful Infringement and Damages  \nHaving found that the jury\u2019s verdict of no infringement of the \u2019532 and \u2019985 patents is \nsupported by sufficient evidence, TRUSTID \u2019s motion for a new trial on willfulness and patent \ndamages is denied.  \nB. False Advertising  \nIn certain marketing material, Next Caller represented that its caller -authentication system \n(1) has the capability to \u201cincrease 10% IVR Cont ainment Rate\u201d and (2) is able  to perform its \nanalysis \u201cpre -answer .\u201d  TRUSTID claimed that these were false statements in violation of the \nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, and the Delaware Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act  \n(\u201cDTPA\u201d), 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2532.  The jury found Next Caller liable under the Lanham Act for its \n\u201cincrease 10% IVR Containment Rate\u201d statement, but not the \u201cpre -answer\u201d statement.  T he jury \ndid not find Next Caller liable for either statement under the DTPA.  The jury awarded TRUSTID \n$1.44 million in compensatory damages and  went on to find that Next Caller\u2019s false \u201cincrease 10% \nIVR Contai nment Rate\u201d representation was  willful and  awarded another $1.44 million dollars in \npunitive damages to TRUSTID .    \n11 Both parties moved for judgment as a m atter of law on the false advertising claims.  \nTRUSTID moves the C ourt to find judgment as a matter of law on the DTPA claim , contending \nthat the jury properly found Next Caller \u201c liable for false advertising and that Next Caller\u2019s false \nadvertising was  willful . . . [but] failed to properly apply these findings to the law when it found \nno liability under the [DTPA].\u201d10  (D.I. 323 at 8).  Next Caller asks the Court to enter judgment of \nno liability under the Lanham Act, arguing that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to reach \nits conclusion.  (D.I. 316 at 5\u201312).  In the alternative, Next Caller asks the Court to reverse the \njury\u2019s award of punitive damages, pointing out that the Lanham Act does not permit such an award.  \n(Id. at 5).   \n1. The Lanham Act  \nThe jury found that TRUSTID proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Next Caller \nis liable for false advertising under the Lanham Act for its \u201cIncrease 10% IVR Containment Rate\u201d statement.  T o prove a violation of the L anham Act, Plaintiff  had the burden of proving the \nfollowing five elements:   \n(1) that the defendant has made false or misleading statements as to \nhis own product ; (2) that there is actual deception or at least a \ntendency to deceive a substantial portion of the intended audience;  \n(3) that the deception is material in that it is likely to influence \npurchasing decisions; (4) that the advert ised goods traveled in \ninterstate commerce; and (5) that there is a likelihood of injury to \nthe plaintiff in terms of declining  sales, loss of good will, etc. \nWarner -Lambert Co. v. Breathasure, Inc., 204 F.3d 87, 91\u201392 (3d Cir. 2000) .  The parties  dispute \nwhether TRUSTID met its burden as to each of the elements other than the fourth.  The Court \naddresses the disputed elements  in turn . \n \n10  TRUSTID did not move on the jury\u2019s finding of no violations involving the \u201cpre- answer\u201d  \nstatement.   \n12 a. The First Element11 \nThe first element , whether the defendant made literally false statements, is a threshold \nquestion.  W ith no false or misleading statement, there can be no liability for false advertising.  To \nmeet its burden for this element, TRUSTID had to prove that Next Caller\u2019s statement is false on \nits face or literally false.  (D.I. 295 at 44).  As to this issue, t he jury was instructed that it \u201cmay find \nthat a completely unsubstantiated advertising claim or claims by Next Caller  is per se  false without \nadditional evidence from TRUSTID to that effect.  A claim is completely unsubstantiated if you \nfind that the advert iser had no semblance of support for the claim at the time it was made.\u201d  Id.   \nSee Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v.  Johnson & Johnson- Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 290 \nF.3d 578, 590 (3d Cir. 2002) .   \nAs to the first element, the jury heard and saw evidence that a Next Caller sales executive \ninstructed its sales team to \u201cjack that stat or make up a number like 8%. \u201d  (Tr. at 345:15- 18; PTX -\n287).  The jury also heard evidence from Next Caller\u2019s former head of engineering, who testified \nthat Next Caller never ve rified the 10% statement and that he did not know how the 10% number \nwas determined.  ( Tr. at 370:2\u201325) .  Although N ext Caller points to testimony from the author of \nthe \u201cjack that stat\u201d email stating that Next Caller used publicly available information an d industry \nresearch to provide a \u201creasonable starting point\u201d for the 10% statement ( Tr. 345:22\u2013346:14)  as \nwells as e vidence that two customers\u2019 experience provided a basis for the 10% number \n(Tr. 322:13\u2013323:18), a \u201ccourt may not weigh the evidence\u201d in revi ewing renewed motions for \njudgment as a matter of law, it must simply determine if there is a sufficient evidentiary  basis for \nthe jury\u2019s conclusion.  Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993).  The  \n \n11  The fourth element, whether the advertised goods traveled in interstate commerce, is the \nLanha m Act\u2019s jurisdictional question.  The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff satisfied its \nburden of proving this element.  \n13 jury had an ample basis for determining that the 10% IVR statement was false or completely \nunsubstantiated and the Court will not disturb its conclusion. \nb. The Second Element  \nElement two  focuses on deception of the intended audience .  Although the description of \nthis element in case law refers to  \u201cactual deception or at least a tendency to deceive,\u201d there is a \ndistinction made based on the relief being sought.  When a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief for a false statement, it need not show actual deception of the public based on the  false statement.  See \nGallup, Inc. v. Talentpoint, Inc., No. 00- 5523, 2001 WL 1450592 *13 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (\u201cWhere \nplaintiff seeks injunctive relief, and shows that a claim is literally false, a court need not consider whether the public is misled. \u201d).  In contrast, wher e a plaintiff seeks only money damages for a \nLanham Act violation, plaintiff must present proof of actual deception.  Id. (\u201cWhere . . . a plaintiff \nseeks monetary damages, proof of actual deception is required. . . . [P]laintiff must show some customer rel iance on the false advertising.\u201d) ; see Parkway Baking Co. v. Freihofer Baking Co., \n255 F.2d 641, 648- 49 (3d Cir. 1958) (\u201c[A] plaintiff in order to make out a cause of action for \ndamages under Section 43(a) must show not only that the defendant\u2019s advertisement is false but also that this falsification actually deceives a portion of the buying public . . . In cases of injunction, \nhowever, there seems to be no requirement that purchasers actually be deceived, but only that the false advertisement s have a tendency to deceive.\u201d); Municipal Revenue Service v. XSpand, Inc., \n700 F. Supp. 2d 692,  716\u201317 (M.D. Pa. 2010) (explaining \u201c[Defendant] states that to obtain monetary damages in a \u00a7 43(a) Lanham Act false advertising case, a plaintiff seeking suc h damages \nmust  prove actual consumer deception, even if the claim is based on \u2018literal falsity.\u2019\u201d).    \nHere, TRUSTID seeks only mone y damages for its false advertising claim s (D.I. 344, \nEx. 2P at 16) , not an injunction.  Thus, TRUSTIS must present proof of actual decepti on.  \u201cActual  \n14 deception requires that the false or misleading statement \u2018actually deceives a portion of the buying \npublic.\u2019  A plaintiff who merely argues how customers could react has not met his or her burden \nto prove actual deception.\u201d  New born Bros. Co., Inc. v. Albion Engineering Company , 481 F. Supp. \n3d 312, 353 (D.N.J. 2020) (citations omitted).   \nIn support of actual deception,12 TRUSTID points to evidence that IVR containment is \nimportant to customers, that the 10% IVR Containment statement was sent to Defendant\u2019s \nprospective customers, and that Defendant published the 10% IVR Containment statement on its \nwebsite.  (D.I. 320 at 8\u20139).   The cited evidence, however, falls short  of showing actual deception.13  \nFirst, that the 10% IVR st atemen t was sent to Defendant\u2019s prospective customers, and that \nDefendant published the 10% IVR statement on its website says little regarding whether any customer was actually deceived.  Similarly, the fact that Defendant intentionally made a false \nstatem ent on a matter generally of importance to customers ( i.e., IVR containment) also does not \nprove that those customers were actually deceived by those statements.  To be sure, the re is no \nrequirement of direct evidence and a jury may make reasonable inferen ces, but the record contains \n \n12  Much of Plaintiff\u2019s briefing is dedicated to arguing that it need not have evidence of actual \ndeception of customers because \u201c[a]ct ual deception or a tendency to deceive is presumed \nif a plaintiff proves that an advertisement is unambiguous and literally false.  (D.I. 320 at \n6).  The cases on which Plaintiff relies to support the purported \u201cpresumption,\u201d however, address only injuncti ve relief, not monetary damages.  (D.I. 320 at 6 (citing Pernod Ricard \nUSA, LLC v. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc., 653 F.3d 241, 248 (3d Cir. 2011); Schering- Plough \nHealthcare Prod., Inc. v. Neutrogena Corp., 702 F. Supp. 2d 266 (D. Del. 2010); Castrol, Inc. v. Pennzoi l, Co., 987 F.2d 939 (3d Cir. 1993)).  And Plaintiff has offered no compelling \nresponse to the longstanding Third Circuit law that \u201ca plaintiff in order to make out a cause of action for damages under Section 43(a) must show not only that the defendant \u2019s \nadvertisement is false but also that this falsification actually deceives a portion of the \nbuying public.\u201d  Parkway Baking Co., 255 F.2d at 648- 49. \n \n13  Given the paucity of evidence cited by TRUSTID as well as TRUSTID\u2019s errant focus on the argument that act ual deception was not required, the  Court re viewed the entire trial \ntranscript to determine whether additional evidence of actual deception existed.  There was none.  \n15 essentially no evidence \u2013  direct or circumstantial \u2013 that customers were actually deceived by the \n10% IVR statement.   Indeed, Plaintiff produced no survey or similar evidence and instead relied \non testimony from four of Next  Caller\u2019s  customers .  That evidence showed that each of these \ncustomers was engaged in discussions with Defendant before the false 10% IVR containment \nstatement was made in September of 2017 .  (PTX 82; PTX 287) .  Two were already customers.  \n(Tr. 313:23- 314:3; Tr. 308:12\u2013309:5; Tr. 312:17\u201320 ).  Moreover, a ll of the customers were already \ntesting Defendant\u2019s product  and there is no evidence that any of these customers  knew about, were \ndeceived by , or relied on Defendant\u2019s st atement .  (Tr. 313:7\u2013313:18; Tr. 308:12\u2013309:5; \nTr. 313:23- 314:7) .14  \nThe fact that the jury found Next Caller\u2019s false advertising to be willful is also insufficient \nto presume actual deception.  Although at least one circuit has recognized such a presumpti on (see \nMerck Eprova AG v. Gnosis S.p.A., 760 F.3d 247, 262 (2d Cir. 2014) ), the Third Circuit has not.   \nTo the contrary, in Johnson & Johnson- Merck Consumer Pharm. Co. v. Rhone -Poulenc Rorer \nPharms., Inc., 19 F.3d 125, 132 (3d Cir. 1994), the Third Circuit held that an intent to mislead alone cann ot create a presumption of actual deception.  Although it arguably left open whether \nunspecified \u201cclear and egregious conduct \u201d might be sufficient to create such a presumption, no \nsuch finding has yet been made .  And indeed at least one court addressing the issue rejected \ncreating a presumption because it would \u201c squarely conflict [] with the above -cited Third Circuit \nauthority establishing that plaintiffs must prove actual customer confusion/deception in order to \n \n14  Although Defendant has more than four customers, as Plaintiff points out in its brie fs, \nPlaintiff elicited no evidence about these customers.   And mere speculation as to how \nunnamed customers \u201ccould react\u201d cannot establish actual deception.  Newborn Bros., \n481 F. Supp. 3d at 353.   \n16 recover money damages for a Lanham Act false advertising claim.\u201d Municipal Revenue Service, \n700 F. Supp. 2d 692, 717 n.45 (M.D. Pa. 2010)  \nc. The Third Element  \nThe third element of the Lanham Act analysis looks to whether any deception is material \n\u2013 i.e., the purchasing decision of the deceived party was impacted by the deceptive statement .  As \nnoted, the Court has found a deficiency in proof as to actual deception regarding the 10% IVR \nstatement , and this necessarily frustrates Plaintiff\u2019s ability to prove that deception based upon that \nstatement made  a difference in influencing customers\u2019 purchasing decisions .   \nEven if that were not the case, however, there is a dearth of evidence that any customer \nrelied on or was impacted b y the 10% IVR statement in connection with making purchasing \ndecisions.  Evidence sufficient to prove materiality generally establishes a causal nexus between \nthe false statement and purchasing decision.15  Here, as previously noted, all of the customers from \nwhom testimony was obtained were  already  involved in discussions with (if  not already a customer \nof) Next  Caller before the 10% IVR statement was made.   Moreover, the only evidence for those \ncustomers that addressed IVR containment suggested that IVR containment was not important or \nrelevant to their purchasing decisions.  (See, e.g. , Tr. 394:3\u20136 (BBVA representative testifying \n\u201cNext Caller has not been used in the [IVR] for containment purposes at all.\u201d); 402:23\u2013403:24 \n(Comcast representative explaining that Comcast does not \u201creally use IVR authentication to drive \nIVR containme nt\u201d an d that Comcast\u2019s use of VeriCall is only \u201cfor calls that ultimately go to the \nagents,\u201d i.e., that are not IVR contained.) ).  \n \n15  For example, materiality has been shown when there is e vidence that customers who \npurchased a product with a false designation on the packaging \u201c did so because of the false \ndesignation and would have refused to purchase this product if they had known of the \nfallacious label.\u201d  See Newborn Bros., 481 F. Supp. 3d at 357.  \n17 d. The Fifth Element  \nThe fifth elements looks to injury to a plaintiff.  Although stated as \u201clikelihood of injury to \nthe plai ntiff,\u201d as with the second element, a plaintiff seeking monetary rather than injunctive relief \nmust show more, i.e., \u201c actual damages rather than a mere tendency to be damaged.\u201d  Synygy, Inc. \nv. Scott \u2013Levin, Inc. , 51 F. Supp. 2d 570, 575 (E.D.  Pa. 1999) .  Therefo re, TRUSTID had to prove \na causal link between the deceptive statement and harm suffered.  Again, the Court has found a \ndeficiency in proof as to actual deception regarding the 10% IVR statement, and this frustrates \nPlaintiff\u2019s ability to prove that decept ion based on  that statement caused injury.16 \n2.  Punitive Damages  \nNext Caller moves for judgment as a matter of law to reverse the jury\u2019s punitive damages \naward because it was only found liable under the Lanham Act.  The Court grants Defendant\u2019s motion for two reasons.  First, the Court has already determined that judgment as a matter of law of no liability under the Lanham Act is appropriate.  Second the Lanham Act does not permit punitive damages.  See Caesars World, Inc. v. Venus Lounge, Inc., 520 F.2d 269, 274\u201375 (3d Cir. 1975) (holding that punitive damages are not available under the Lanham Act and that no court has awarded punitive damages under the statute); SurgiQuest v. Lexion Medical, Inc., No. 14- 382-\n \n16  Unlike with the fourth element, had the Court found actual deception, it appears that the \nfifth element was met.  Plaintiff elicited testimony that Defendant is in direct competition with Plaintiff for customers, as Defendant\u2019s employees s ugge sted that Plaintiff \u201cis a real \ncompetitor\u201d and \u201cmaybe [sic] our only real competitor.\u201d  (PTX -404).  Along these same \nlines, Plaintiff introduced evidence that Defendant\u2019s employees believed \u201c100% we are competing with TRUSTID and not at all with Pindro p.\u201d  (PTX -296).  The jury therefore \nreceived substantial evidence for finding that Plaintiff and Defendant directly competed for customers, which would reasonably imply that any customer Defendant obtained because of its false statement were customers that  were diverted from Plaintiff.    \n18 GMS, 2018 WL 2247216 at *6 n.14 (D. Del.  May 16, 2018) (\u201cPunitive damages are not \nrecoverable under the Lanham Act.\u201d).17     \n3. Pre- and Post -Judgment Interest  \nBecause the Court has held that judgment as a matter of law of no liability should be entered \non the Lanham Act claim, and because the Co urt finds punitive damages unavailable under the \nLanham Act, Plaintiff\u2019s motion  for pre - and post -judgment interest  is DENIED- AS-MOOT.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter \nof law on infringem ent of the\u2019532 and\u2019985 patents  and false advertising under the DTPA, for a \nnew trial on willful infringement and damages and for pre - and post -judgment interest and award.  \nand GRANTS Defendant\u2019s motion for judgement as a m atter of l aw of no false advertising and no \npunitive damages.  An appropriate order will follow.  \n \n17  TRUSTID appears (at least tacitly) to acknowledge that punitive damages are not \nrecoverable solely for a Lanham Act violation and argues only that punitive damages are appropriate because \u201cthe jury\u2019s finding of false adverti sing under the Lanham Act compels \nJMOL of false advertising  under the DTPA,\u201d and because the DTPA permits punitive \ndamages upon a finding of willfulness, the punitive damages should stand.
