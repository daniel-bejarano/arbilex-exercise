WILLIAMS, \nPetitioner, \nV. \nROBERT MAY, Warden,1 and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE \nOF DELAWARE, \nRespondents. \nMEMORANDUM \nI. BACKGROUND Civ. A. No. 20-13-CFC \nIn October 1998, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment (consolidating \nthree indictments) charging Petitioner David M. Williams with fourteen offenses. Four of \nthe counts stemmed from Petitioner's arrest on March 25, 1998 for attempting to \nburglarize a residence in Wilmington, Delaware: two counts of attempted second degree \nburglary, one count of possession of burglar's tools, and one count of criminal mischief. \nOn June 24, 1999, the Superior Court severed those four charges from the remaining \ncharges; it then presided over a two-day jury trial of those four charges. The jury, \nhowever, was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and Petitioner was retried in August \n1999. Petitioner represented himself during the second trial, and the Superior Court \nappointed stand-by counsel. The jury convicted Petitioner of all four offenses. See \n1Warden Robert May replaced former Warden Dana Metzger, an original party to the \ncase. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). State v. Williams, 2000 WL 33726917, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Jul. 14, 2000). Sentencing \nwas set for October 8, 1999, and the State filed a motion to have Petitioner sentenced \nas a habitual offender for the two counts of attempted second degree burglary. See id. \nat *4; Williams v. State, 966 A.2d 349 (Table), 2009 WL 234637, at *1 (Del. Feb. 2, \n2009). \nOn October 7, 1999, Petitioner pied guilty to two of the remaining charges \ncontained in the superseding indictment -forgery\u00b7 in the second degree and attempted \nescape in the third degree -in addition to a new charge of attempted third degree \nescape. See Williams v. State, 856 A.2d 1067 (Table), 2004 WL 1874693, at *1 (Del. \nAug. 13, 2004); Williams v. State, 911 A.2d 804 (Table), 2006 WL 3053265, at *1 n.3 \n(Del. Oct. 27, 2006); (D.I. 14 at 2 in Williams v. State, Civ. A. No. 5-386-GMS). \nOn October 8, 1999, the Superior Court declared Petitioner to be an habitual \noffender for the attempted burglary convictions and sentenced Petitioner, in all of his \ncases, to a total of twenty-seven years at Level V, suspended after twenty-six years for \none year at Level IV followed by probation. See Williams v. Snyder, 2003 WL \n22480168, at *1 (D. Del. Oct. 27, 2003); Williams, 2004 WL 1874693, at *1 (Del. Aug. \n13, 2004); Williams v. State, 966 A.2d 349 (Table), 2009 WL 234627, at *1 (Del. Feb. 2, \n2009). Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentences, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed the Superior Court's judgment. See Williams, 2003 WL 22480168, at *1. \nIn 2001, Petitioner filed his first \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his 1999 convictions, \nwhich the Honorable Gregory M. Sleet denied as procedurally barred. See Williams, \n2003 WL 22480168, at *7. In 2005, Petitioner filed a second habeas petition \n2 challenging his 1999 convictions as well as an alleged violation of probation charge. \nJudge Sleet denied the repetitive claims regarding Petitioner's 1999 convictions as \nsecond or successive, and denied the claim concerning a violation of probation as \nlacking in factual support. See Williams v. Carroll, 2006 WL 2949303 (D. Del. Oct. 17, \n2006). Thereafter, Petitioner filed three more federal habeas petitions -in 2009, 2012, \nand 2014 -all of which were denied as second or successive. See Williams v. Phelps, \nCiv. A. No. 9-570-GMS, Order (D. Del. Nov. 16, 2009); Williams v. Phelps, Civ. A. No. \n12-1647-GMS, Mem. & Order (D. Del. July 31, 2013); Williams v. Pierce, Civ. A. No. 14-\n1065-GMS, Mem. & Order (D. Del. Dec. 29, 2017). \nSometime around November 2017, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior \nCourt a \"Request for a Certificate of Eligibility to File Under 11 Del. Code\u00a7 4214(f) and \nDel. Super. Ct. Spec. R. 2017-1(d)\" (hereinafter referred to as \"request for sentence \nreview\"). (D.I. 3 at 4; D.I. 3-2 at 1-3); see also State v. Williams, 2018 WL 2938313, at \n*1-2 (Del. Super. Ct. June 8, 2018). In the request for sentence review, Petitioner \nsought permission to file a petition asking the Superior Court to exercise its jurisdiction \nto modify his sentence under the recently enacted 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214(f).2 See Williams, \n2018 WL 2938313 at *1-2. The Superior Court denied the request for sentence review \non June 8, 2018. See Williams, 2018 WL 2938313, at *3. In August 2018, Petitioner \nfiled a Rule 61 motion challenging the Superior Court's denial of his request for \n2Section 4214(f) \"permits a defendant sentenced as a habitual criminal before July 19, \n2016 'to a minimum sentence of not less than the statutory maximum penalty for a \nviolent felony pursuant to subsection (a) of this section' to petition the Superior Court for \nsentence modification after the defendant has 'served a sentence of incarceration equal \nto any applicable mandatory sentence otherwise required by this section or the statutes \ndescribing said offense .... \"' Williams, 2018 WL 2938313, at *1. \n3 sentence review. See State v. Williams, 2019 WL 1558580, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. \n8, 2019). The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on April 30, 2019. See State v. \nWilliams, 2019 WL 1983407, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2019). Sometime after April \n2019, Petitioner filed a Rule 35 motion challenging his sentence under 11 Del. Code \u00a7 \n4217(b). See Williams v. State, 2021 WL 4272908, at *1 (Del. Sept. 20, 2021). The \nSuperior Court construed the motion as seeking a reduction of sentence under Rule \n35(b), and denied it as time barred, duplicative, and procedurally defective. See id. \nPetitioner appealed. In September 2021, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the \nSuperior Court's decision and also held that, to the extent Petitioner was seeking \ncorrection of an illegal sentence under Rule 35(a), Petitioner failed to establish that his \nsentence was illegal. See id. \nMeanwhile, in June 2018, Petitioner filed in this Court a sixth petition for writ of \nhabeas corpus (\"2018 petition\") asserting six grounds for relief. (See D.I. 3 in Williams \nv. Metzger, Civ. A. No. 18-922-CFC) Claim One alleged that Petitioner's conviction \nand/or sentence for escape should be withdrawn and also that his discretionary \nsentences should be reduced by applying earned good-time credits. (See D.I. 3 in \nWilliams, Civ. A. No. 18-922-CFC) Claims Two, Three, Four and Six alleged ineffective \nassistance of counsel, and Claim Five alleged that the Superior Court erred in denying \nPetitioner's request for sentence review under 11 Del. Code\u00a7 4217. (See id.) In \nJanuary 2019, the Court dismissed Claims One, Two, Three, Four, and Six without \nprejudice for being unexhausted, and dismissed Claim Five for failing to assert an issue \ncognizable on federal habeas review. (See D.I. 5 in Williams, Civ. A. No. 18-922-CFC) \n4 In January 2020, while his appeal from the Superior Court's denial of his Rule 35 \nmotion was pending before the Delaware Supreme Court, Petitioner filed in this Court a \nseventh habeas petition (hereinafter referred to as \"Original 2020 Petition\"), which \ntriggered the opening of the instant case. (D.I. 3) The Court issued an order directing \nPetitioner to show cause why the Original 2020 Petition should not be summarily \ndismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. (D.I. 5) \nPetitioner did not file any document directly responding to the Court's show \ncause order. Instead, in August 2021, Petitioner filed in this Court a new habeas \npetition (his eighth), which triggered the opening of a new habeas case: Williams v. \nState, Civ. A. No. 21-1134-CFC. (See D.I. in Williams, Civ. A. No. 21-1134-CFC) The \n2021 petition asserted one claim for relief challenging Petitioner's 1999 sentence, \nnamely, that the Superior Court erroneously refused to award him presentence credit for \nthe 192 days he served in custody from April 1, 1999 to October 8, 1999. (D.I. 6 at 5) \nPetitioner also filed in the new 2021 habeas case a copy of a February 5, 2020 decision \nby the Superior Court denying two motions he had filed challenging his sentence: (1) \none motion sought credit for time previously served from April 1, 1999 to October 8, \n1999; and (2) one motion sought a correction of sentence under 11 Del. Code\u00a7 4217A. \n(D.I. 7 at 5) After reviewing the filings in Petitioner's 2021 habeas case in conjunction \nwith the filings in the instant proceeding, the Court construed Petitioner's filings in his \n2021 habeas case as an attempt to demonstrate that he had exhausted state remedies \nfor at least one of the claims raised in his Original 2020 Petition. Therefore, the Court \nordered the Clerk to administratively close the new 2021 habeas proceeding and to file \n5 the new 2021 petition and related filings in the instant habeas proceeding, hereinafter \nreferred to as \"Amended Petition.\" (See D.I. 6; D.I. 6-1; D.I. 7) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly \nappears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is \nnot entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. A district court can entertain a \nhabeas petition \"in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State \ncourt only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or \ntreaties of the United States,\" and only if the relief sought is either immediate release or \nspeedier release. See Preiserv. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475,500 (1973). It is well-settled \nthat a district court engaging in federal habeas review must accept a state supreme \ncourt's interpretation of state law,3 and claims asserting a violation of a state law, or \nchallenging a state court's interpretation of state law, do not present cognizable issues \nfor the purpose of federal habeas review. Swarthout v. Cooke, 562 U.S. 216, 219 \n(2011); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-8 (1991). For instance, a state prisoner's \nright to credit for time served before sentencing is a matter of state law. See Hoover v. \nSnyder, 904 F. Supp. 232, 234 (D.Del.1995); Hardy v. Luzerne County, 2007 WL \n2253463, at *1-2 (M.D. Pa. Aug.3, 2007). Additionally, the \"federal role in reviewing in \nan application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or \nfederal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner's conviction; what occurred in the \n3See Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005). \n6 petitioner's collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas calculation.\" Hassine \nv. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nTogether, Petitioner's Original 2020 Petition (Claims One through Six)4 and \nAmended Petition (Claim Seven) present the following grounds for relief: (1) the \nSuperior Court erred in denying his request to reduce his discretionary sentences via \nthe application of earned good-time credits and in denying his request to \nwithdraw/reduce his escape sentence because the escape statute was repealed (D.I. 3 \nat 5); (2) the Delaware public defender assigned to his case provided ineffective \nassistance and/or operated under a conflict of interest by refusing to file a request for \nsentence modification/reduction based on the repealed escape statute issue (D.I. 3 at \n7); (3) the Delaware public defender assigned to his case provided ineffective \nassistance and/or operated under a conflict of interest by filing the \"wrong 4214\" on his \ncase (D.I. 3 at 8-9); (4) the Delaware public defender assigned to his case provided \nineffective assistance and/or operated under a conflict of interest by filing a response to \nthe Superior Court with the wrong inmate's name on it (D.I. 3 at 1 O); (5) the Delaware \nSuperior Court erred in denying his request for sentence review (D.I. 3 at 4); (6) the \npublic defender assigned to his case provided ineffective assistance during the request \n4The Original 2020 Petition actually only identifies four specific claims for relief. \nHowever, based on Petitioner's statements in the paragraph concerning the timeliness \nof the petition, the Court discerns two additional separate claims being alleged -Claims \nFive and Six. (D.I. 3 at 13 ,I18) \n7 for sentence review proceeding (D.I. 3 at 13-14); and (7) the Superior Court erroneously \nrefused to award him presentence credit for the 192 days he served in custody from \nApril 1, 1999 to October 8, 1999 (D.I. 6 at 5). \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that Petitioner has not answered the show \ncause order directing him to demonstrate if he has exhausted state remedies for Claims \nOne, Two, Three, Four and Six. Therefore, the Court will dismiss Claims One, Two, \nThree, Four and Six without prejudice for being unexhausted. \nThe remaining two grounds for relief -Claims Five and Seven -are not \ncognizable habeas claims. Claim Five challenges the Superior Court's June 8, 2018 \ndenial of Petitioner's request for sentence review, during which Petitioner asked the \nSuperior Court to modify his habitual offender sentences under the newly enacted 11 \nDel. C. \u00a7 4214(f). After interpreting and applying Delaware precedent, the Superior \nCourt concluded that Petitioner was not eligible for a sentence review under\u00a7 4214(f) \nbecause Petitioner \"did not receive a minimum sentence of not less than the statutory \nmaximum penalty for the violent felony.\" See State v. Williams, 2018 WL 2938313, at \n*2 (Del. Super. Ct. June 8, 2018). Claim Five merely asserts an error of state law \nbecause it challenges the Superior Court's interpretation and application of Delaware \nstate law without implicating the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. \nAdditionally, Petitioner's request for sentence review was filed pursuant to Delaware \nSuperior Court Rule 2017-1, which constitutes a collateral proceeding because such a \nrequest is presented as a motion for modification of sentence. See Del. Super. Ct. \n8 Spec. R. 2017-1 ( d)( 1) (\"An application under this rule shall be made by a petition for \nsentence modification.\") \nClaim Seven challenges the Superior Court's refusal to award Petitioner \npresentence credit for the 192 days he served in custody from April 1, 1999 to October \n8, 1999. (D.I. 6 at 5) The Superior Court denied Petitioner's request to be credited for \nthe 192-day period after explaining that Petitioner had been provided all the credit to \nwhich he is entitled because the effective date of his sentence was April 1, 1999, and \nnot October 8, 1999. (D.I. 7 at 5) In this proceeding, Petitioner does not assert any \ndiscernible argument as to why the Superior Court erroneously relied on the effective \ndate of his sentence when determining that he has been awarded the correct amount of \ncredit. Instead, Petitioner cites Delaware Department of Correction Policy 7.25 and \ncontends that he should be credited \"day for day\" for the 192 days he served prior to his \nOctober 8, 1999 sentencing because that time period \"isn't subject to the statutory good \ntime law.\" (D.I. 5 at 2; D.I. 7 at 2) Distilled to its core, Claim Seven challenges the \nmanner in which the Superior Court calculated any presentence credit due to Petitioner, \nbut does not challenge the legality of Petitioner's conviction or allege that Petitioner has \nsuffered an unconstitutional deprivation of credit.6 (D.I. 7 at 3) \n5See https:/ / doc.delaware.gov / assets/documents/policies/policy_7-2.pdf. \n6Although there \"is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be \nconditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence,\" Greenholtz v. Inmates \nof Nebraska Penal & Con: Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979), a claim alleging an \nunconstitutional deprivation of credit against a term of imprisonment does assert an \nissue cognizable on federal habeas review. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, \n487 (1973). \n9 Based on the foregoing , the Court will dismiss Claims Five and Seven for failing \nto assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the Original \n2020 Petition and the Amended Petition. Claims One, Two, Three, Four, and Six will be \ndismissed without prejudice because they are unexhausted. Claims Five and Seven will \nbe dismissed with prejudice because they fail to assert issues cognizable on federal \nhabeas review. \nThe Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because \nPetitioner has failed to make a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional \nright.\" See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United States v. Eyer, \n113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order will be entered. \nDated: January 18, 2020 \nChief Judge \n10 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nDAVID M. WILLIAMS , \nPetitioner , \nV. \nDANA METZGER, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE \nOF DELAWARE , \nRespondents . Civ. A. No. 20-13-CFC \nORDER \nAt Wilmington , this ~day of January 2021 for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Petitioner David M. Williams' Original 2020 Petition and Amended Petition for \na Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.I. 3; D.I. 6) are summarily \nDISMISSED. Claims One, Two, Three, Four, and Six are dismissed without prejudice \nfor failure to exhaust state remedies. Claims Five and Seven are dismissed with \nprejudice for failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. \n2. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner \nhas failed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \n{}L ?{ {l_ \nColm F.
