No. 22- 453-LPS \n       : \nBOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA,  : \n       : \n Defendant.      : \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n \nPending before the Court is the motion of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\u201c PDVSA\u201d) to \nintervene and to stay briefing on Gold Reserve\u2019s Motion for Conditional Writ of Attachment \nFieri Facias .  (D.I. 10)  The Court has received and reviewed the motion (D.I. 10) and the \nbriefing filed in connection with it (D.I. 12, 13 ).  Having done so, and for the reasons stated \nbelow, PDVSA\u2019s motion to intervene , which is unopposed, is GRANTED, and the motion  to \nstay briefing on Gold Reserve\u2019s m otion is DENIED. \n1. PDVSA seeks intervention pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, \ncontending it is entitled to intervention as of right (Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) (2)) and should also be \ngranted permissive intervention (Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1) (B)).  (See D.I. 10  at 3- 7)  Gol d Reserve \nconsents to this intervention.  ( See D.I. 12 at 1 n.1)  PDVSA\u2019s motion to intervene is , therefore, \ngranted.  \n2. PDVSA also asks the Court to stay briefing on Gold Reserve\u2019s Attachment \nMotion (D.I. 2) pending the resolution of attachment motions filed  in related actions by \nsimilarly -situated judgment creditors ( OIEG (Misc. No. 19- 290), ACL (Misc. No. 21- 46), 2 Rusoro (Misc. No. 21- 481), and Huntington Ingalls (Misc. No. 20- 257)).  (See, e.g., D.I. 10 at 7-\n8) \n3. The Court has considerable discretion in deciding a stay motion.  See, e.g., Landis \nv. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254- 55 (1936).  In exercising that discretion, the Court \ntypically considers three factors: (i) \u201cwhether a stay will simplify the issues for trial\u201d;  \n(ii) \u201cwhether discovery is complete and a trial date has been set\u201d; and (iii) \u201cwhether a s tay would \nunduly prejudice or present a clear tactical disadvantage to the non- moving party.\u201d  UCB, Inc. v. \nHetero USA Inc. , 277 F. Supp. 3d 687, 690 (D. Del. 2017)  (citing Landis , 299 U.S. at 254- 55).  \nThe Court may also consider other factors, including \u201cwhether the moving party would face \nhardship or inequity in going forward with the litigation.\u201d  Id .  Ultimately, the Court should try to \nweigh all competing interests and \u201cmaintain an even balance.\u201d  Landis , 299 U.S. at 254- 55. \na. Staying briefing on Gold R eserve\u2019s motion will not  simplify the issues , but \ncomplicate them, which counsels that the motion should be denied.  Gold Reserve\u2019s motion \npresents similar, if not identical, issues as those pending before the Court in the other cases with attachment motio ns.  It will simplify the instant case (as well as the Court\u2019s handling of all \nrelated cases) to consider these issues together rather than piecemeal.  S taying the motion , on the \nother hand, would complicate the resolution of the case, as the pertinent -time analysis\n0F1 will grow \nto encompass a larger window of time, requiring the Court to make potentially new or different factual findings . \n \n1 This Court has held that the pertinent time for the alter -ego analysis is \u201cthe period between the \nfiling of the motion seeking a writ of attachment and the subsequent issuance and service of that \nwrit.\u201d  Crystallex Int\u2019l Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Ve nezuela , 2021 WL 129803, at *6 (D. \nDel. Jan. 14, 2021).  3 b.  The stage of this case is either neutral or weighs against staying briefing.  Gold \nReserve calls this factor \u201cinapplicable\u201d (D.I. 12 at 2)  while PDVSA makes no specific argument \nregarding it ( see D.I. 13 at 1).  There is certainly nothing about the stage of the case that \nrecommends staying briefing at this time.  \nc. The risk of prejudice to Gold Reserve weighs against the requested stay.  As Gold \nReserve explains , delay ing resolution of  its attachment motion  might  \u201cdelay Gold Reserve \njoining the other judgment creditors and, potentially, the Sales Process.\u201d  (D.I. 12 at 4)  There is \nno reason for Gold Reserve to bear that risk at this time. \nd. Finally, t here is no reason to believe that PDVSA will face hardship or ineq uity in \ngoing forward with the litigation, especially considering that it is already appearing in parallel proceedings regarding the resolution of OIEG\u2019s, ACL\u2019s, Rusoro\u2019s, and Huntington Ingalls\u2019 attachment motions.  \n4. Given the Court\u2019s assessment of the rele vant factors, the Court will deny \nPDVSA\u2019s motion to stay briefing.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties shall meet and confer and, no later than \nJanuary 13, 2023, submit (i) a proposed order the Court may sign to effectuate PDVSA\u2019s \nintervention as a part y and to establish a process for completing briefing and submission of \nproposed findings of fact with respect to Gold Reserve\u2019s pending motion; and (ii) a joint status \nreport with the parties\u2019 positions on whether there has been any material change to any fact  \n  4 relevant to the factual determination(s) the Court must make with respect to the pending alter -\nego issues  since April 2021 and, if there has been, whether (and if so, what) evidentiary \nproceedings either party requests.  \n \n \n________________________________ \nJanuary 11, 2023     HONORABLE LEONARD P.
