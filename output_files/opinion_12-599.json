(formerly known as Correctional Medical \nServices of Delaware, Inc.  (\u201cCMS\u201d) , Correct Care Solutions, LLC  (\u201cCCS\u201d) , and Dean R eiger \n(collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d).  (D.I. 238).  For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS \nDefendants\u2019 motion. I. BACKGROUND\n1 \nOn May 14, 2012, Wayne R. Averill (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) , a former inmate at James T. Vaughn \nCorrection Center  (\u201cJTVCC\u201d)  and Howard R. Young Correctional Institution (\u201cHRYCI\u201d) , filed a \npro se  complaint asserting violations of his civil rights pursuant to Section 1983, as well as claims \nof medical negligence, medical malpractice, and negligence.  (D.I. 3).   On May 9, 2016, Plaintiff \nwas appointed counsel.   (D.I. 139).  Almost a year later, Plaintiff sought leave (D.I. 154) to file his \nThird Amended  Complaint  (\u201cComplaint\u201d) , an action under  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that name d eleven \nDefendants  and alleged violation s of his Eighth Amendment rights .  (D.I. 174).  Since filing that  \nComplaint, t he parties stipulated to dismiss one defendant  (D.I. 192) and the Court entered  \nsummary judgment in favor of four others (D.I. 205) , leaving the six remaining Defendants whose  \nmotion for summary judgment is now before the Court. \nThe Complaint details events that took place from 2009 to 2013.  During this time, Plaintif f \nwas incarcerated at HRYCI  until May 27, 2010, when he was transferred to JTVCC .  (D.I. 174 \n\u00b6\u00b6 16\u201331).  From the beginning of this period until June 30, 2010, Defenda nt CMS was contracted \nto provide healthcare for Delaware\u2019s inmates.  ( Id. \u00b6 3; D.I. 181 \u00b6 3).  From July 1, 2010 through \n \n1  This case has been litigated for nearly a decade and has an extensive procedural history.  \nAccordingly, the Court will lay out only what is relevant to the present motion.  For a more \ndetailed account of this case\u2019s history, see Averill v. Jones , No. 12- 599-MN, 2019 WL \n3804686 (D. Del. Aug. 13, 2019) . 2 the end of the relevant period of the Complaint, Defendant CCS provided healthcare to  Delaware \ninmates .  (D.I.  174 \u00b6 \u00b6 7, 49; D.I. 183 \u00b6 7 ).  Defendants Jones, Davenport, and Rodgers were \nmedical professionals employed by or independent contractors of CMS, and are therefore referred \nto, alongside  CMS, as  the \u201cCMS Defendants.\u201d  ( D.I. 174 \u00b6\u00b6 4\u20136; D.I. 181 \u00b6\u00b6 4\u20136).  Defendant \nReiger  was a medical professional employed by CCS  (collectively Reiger and C CS are the \u201cC CS \nDefendants\u201d).   (D.I. 174 \u00b6 8; D.I. 241 at 5).  \nA. The CMS  Defendants  \nPlaintiff alleges that on May 18, 2010, he received hydrocele surgery to treat  a fluid build -\nup around his te sticles.  ( D.I. 174 \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201320).  For the next eight  days, Plaintiff was placed  in the \nHYRCI  infirmary, where he alleges that he slept on an unsanitary mattress, began experiencing \nsevere post-operative complications that caused  excessive pain , and had vital readings that were \nconsistent with  an infection.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 22 \u201328).  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Jones , a medical \ndoctor, dismissed these vital readings as incorrect, blaming them on \u201cold\u201d and \u201cunreliable\u201d \nequipment.  ( Id. \u00b6 23).  Further, Plainti ff claims that Jones ignored Plaintiff\u2019s complaints about his \npain and sleeping conditions , called him a \u201ccry baby,\u201d and released him from the infirmary in a \ndeteriorating condition.  ( Id. \u00b6 29).  Plaintiff states that he was then forced to sleep on a mattress \non the floor of the cell next to the toilet, which exacerbated his medical complications.  ( Id. \u00b6 30).   \nOn May 27, 2010, Plaintiff was transferred to the JTVCC .  (Id. \u00b6 31).  Plaintiff claims that, \non his ride there, he was forced to sit on the floor  of the transfer bus while handcuffed to other \ninmates, which aggravated  the complications from his surgery.  ( Id. \u00b6 32).  During JTVCC\u2019s  intake \nprocedure, Plaintiff alleges that the officers conducting his strip search noticed his condition and told Defendant Davenport that Plaintiff should be housed in the infirmary and that Davenport, a nurse, should examine Plaintiff.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 33 \u201334).  Plaintiff , however, claims that Davenport not 3 only refused to assess Plaintiff  or treat his condition, but also told him that the infirmary was full.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 34 \u201336).  Plaintiff alleges that the officers who conducted the strip search then called \nDefendant  Rodgers, a doctor, to have him admitted to the infirmary, but Rodgers affirmed \nDavenport\u2019s decision without e ver examining Plaintiff.   (Id. \u00b6 37).  Plaintiff claims that  he was \nthen placed in a secure unit, where he began experiencing increased pain and w orsening  \ncomplications , but his complaints about his  ailments went ignored.  ( Id. \u00b6 38).   \nPlaintiff alleges  that he was eventually able to see a doctor , who observed discoloration \nthat he believed to be caused by internal bleeding, and placed  Plaintiff on ten days of antibiotics \nand Vicodin.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 40 \u201342).  That doctor also scheduled a post -operation check -up that Plaintiff \nclaims he  missed  due to his transfer to the JTVCC .  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 42\u201344).   Plaintiff  states  that when he  \nlater attended that check -up, the attending physician discovered that  he was suffering from \ncomplications from his May 18, 2010 surgery  that may not have developed had  he attended the \npost-operation check- up that he was forced to miss .  (Id. \u00b6 44).   \nOn June 24, 2010, Plaintiff underwent a corrective surgery to address those complications .  \n(Id. \u00b6 46).  Plaintiff claims that he spent two days recovering from that surgery in the infirmary at \nthe JTVCC  before being  released to his cell.  ( Id. \u00b6 47).  There, Plainti ff alleges that \u201cthe CMS \nDefendants refused to provide him with sterile bandages and saline necessary to clean and bandage \nhis wounds.\u201d  ( Id.).  The Complaint concludes its section dealing with the CMS Defendants with \nPlaintiff\u2019s allegation that the CMS Defendants  knew that Plaintiff was suffering from severe \ncomplications following his initial surgery but intentionally delayed providing the necessary medical care to Plaintiff.  ( Id. \u00b6 48).    4 B. The CCS Defendants2  \nOn July 1, 2010, as Plaintiff was recover ing from his corrective surgery, CCS became the \ngeneral healthcare provider for the Delaware Department of Correction.  ( Id. \u00b6 49).  Plaintiff claims \nthat, around this time, he developed complications  (severe pain, incontinence, infrequent and \npainful erec tions, and weight gain due to decreased testosterone levels)  from his corrective surgery , \nbut none of these maladies were addressed by CCS personnel.  ( Id. \u00b6 52).  Plaintiff also asserts  that \nbecause CMS and CCS fail ed to care for his wounds after  his corr ective surgery and permitted  him \nto sleep in unsanitary conditions , he developed a staph infection.  ( Id. \u00b6 53).   \nPlaintiff claims  that when he later visited a doctor on August 29, 2011, the doctor diagnosed \nhim with lower urinary tract symptoms and  a hydrocele , told Plaintiff that he needed chronic pain \nmanagement, suggested that Plaintiff consider a right orchiectomy or an epididymectomy, and \nurged Plaintiff to get a second opinion.  ( Id. \u00b6 56).  But Plaintiff claims that C CS personnel refused \nto pre scribe pain medication, failed to provide ointment for his infection, did not arrange for him \nto sleep in a bottom bunk, and refused to  schedule an appointment for him to receive a  second \nopinion.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 57\u201358).   On October 4, 2011, Plaintiff alleges tha t he developed MRSA,  but CCS \ndid not initially inform him about or treat his diagnosis .  (Id. \u00b6 59).  Plaintiff claims that he \ncontinued to complain about his various ailments through December 2012, but CCS refused to \nexamine or treat them.  ( Id. \u00b6 66).  \nEventually, Plaintiff was able to meet with Defendant Reiger, a doctor, in December 2012.  \nPlaintiff states  that after he told Reiger about his severe pain and how he was not receiving \n \n2  Much of the Complaint\u2019s section dealing with the CCS Defendants contains  allegations \nagainst Defendants who have since been dismissed from this action.  Accordingly, the \nCourt will not detail those allegations unless necessary to give context to the allegations against the remaining CCS Defendants.  5 medications, Re iger told him \u201cthat if his testicle hurt so bad, he should cut it off and that he could \nfunction with just one testicle.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 67).  Plaintiff alleges that Reiger told him that he could \neither have the surgery to remove his testicle or deal with the pai n without any medication.  ( Id.).  \nUltimately, Plaintiff asserts that \u201cReiger did nothing to address CCS\u2019s repeated failures to treat his \nserious medical conditions and reaffirmed CCS\u2019s refusal to prescribe Plaintiff with the necessary pain management medi cation or order alternative prescriptions equal to or more helpful than the \nmedications that CCS could no longer prescribe.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 70).  \nPlaintiff claims that on March 4, 2013, he was eventually able to see another doctor , \nDr. Paul, who recommended that he undergo a  corrective surgery to correct nerve damage caused \nby the initi al surgery but not fixed by the corrective surgery.  ( Id. \u00b6 72).  When Dr. Paul sent \nPlaintiff to Dr. Swier to evaluate Plaintiff for the recommended surgery, Dr. Swier administer ed \nnerve blocks to ident ify the nerves responsible for the pain he was experiencing .  (Id. \u00b6 73).  In the \nsummer of 2013, Plaintiff states that he received another round of nerve blocks from Dr. Swier, \nwho echoed Dr. Paul\u2019s recommendation that Plaintiff recei ve surgery to correct nerve damage.  \n(Id. \u00b6 75).  But Plaintiff alleges that despite CCS\u2019s knowledge that Plaintiff was in considerable \npain and had been recommended this surgery, CCS not only never arranged for Plaintiff to receive the surgery, but also deprived him of pain medication or necessary medical care.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 76 \u201380).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  F ED. R. \nCIV. P. 56(a).   When determining whether a genuine issue of material f act exists, this Court must \nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the non- moving party and draw all reasonable \ninferences in that party\u2019s favor.  Scott v. Harris , 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Wishkin v. Potter , 6 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007).  A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if the evidence is such that a \nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the non -moving party, and a factual dispute is material \nwhen it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201349 (1986).  \nIf the moving party makes a prima facie case that no genuine issue of material fact exists \nfor an element, t he nonmoving party bears the burden to establish the existence of each element of \nhis case.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catre tt, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  In doing so, the non- moving \nparty must present specific evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude in his favor.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; Jones v. United Parcel Serv., 214 F.3d 402, 407 (3d Cir. 2000).  \n\u201cThe non- moving party . . . may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings \u201d \nbut, instead, \u201cmust set forth specific fa cts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Bare \nassertions, conclusory allegations, or suspicions will not suf fice.\u201d  D.E. v. Central Dauphin School \nDist. , 765 F.3d 260, 268 \u201369 (3d Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).  Summary judgment should be \ngranted if no reasonable trier of fact could find for the non- moving party.  Radich v. Goode , \n886 F.2d 1391, 1395 (3d Cir. 1989). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Eighth Amendment \u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment requires that \nprison officials provide inmates with adequate medical care.  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. 97, 103\u2013\n05 (1976).  In order to set forth a cognizable claim, an inmate must allege (i) a serious medical need and (ii) acts or omissions by prison officials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need.  Estelle , 429 U.S. at 104; Rouse v. Plantier , 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999).   \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff has  both failed to produce  eviden ce suggesting that he  \nsuffered from a serious medical need and that prison officials acted, or failed to act, in ways that 7 were  deliberately  indifferen t to that serious medical need.  Defendants also point out that Plaintiff \ndid not present an expert opini on to support his claim, which Defendants contend is necessary.  \nLast, Defendant s CMS and C CS assert  that Plaintiff failed to present evidence that either of them  \nmaintained a policy , practice,  or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged \nconstit utional harm.   \nA. Serious Medical Need  \n\u201cA medical need is serious . . . if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as \nrequiring treatment or one that is so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity \nfor a doctor \u2019s attention.\u201d   Monmouth Cty. Corr. Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, \n347 (3d Cir. 1987)  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Defendant s submit that \u201cthere \nis no record evidence to support \u201d the notion that Plaintiff suffered from a serious medical need.   \nThe Court disagrees.  Plaintiff\u2019s medical file, submitted by  Defendants, shows  extensive  \ntreatment and diagnoses.  For example, on May 28, 2010, a CMS employee noted that a nurse was \ninformed that Plaintiff\u2019s scrotum was large and discolored.  (D.I. 242 at 58).  O n June 15, 2010, a \nCMS employee directly observed that  Plaintiff\u2019s scrotum was \u201cstill very much swollen \u201d, noted \npenile discharge , and recommended scheduling an appointment  for Plaintiff as soon as possible.  \n(Id. at 55).  Indeed, the bulk of the medical file submitted to the Court involves treatment by a \nphysician and reports a condition, described above, \u201cthat is so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor \u2019s attention.\u201d  Consequently, summary judgment cannot \nbe awarded in favor of Defendants on the  basis  that there is no genuine issue of material fact that \nPlaintiff did not suffer from a serious medical need. 8 B. Deliberate Indifference  \nPlaintiff alleges that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical \nneed.   Plaintiff alleges that the  CMS Defendants failed to treat his complications, delayed in getting \nhim to a follow -up appointment, and administered insufficient treatment.  (D.I. 174 \u00b6\u00b6 87\u201390).  \nPlaintiff claims that the CCS Defendants denied his access to a recommended nerve surgery and \ndelayed in providing him with necessary medical care.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 96 \u201399).   Both sets of Defendants \nassert that there is an absence of genuinely disputed material fact on this front because they submitted evidence that they were not deliberately indifferent and Plaintiff failed to present evidence that any Defendant acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs.  (D.I. 241 at 12\u201317).  Plaintiff disagrees, pointing not to any documents or sworn testimony, but to unsworn \nalleg ations in the Third Ame nded Complaint.  (D.I. 244 at 5\u201311).  \nA prison official is deliberately indifferent if he knows that a prisoner faces a substantial \nrisk of serious harm and fails to take reasonable steps to avoid the harm.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).  A prison official may violate the Eighth Amendment by either \nproviding inadequate medical care  with a culpable state of mind or by intentionally delaying or \ndenying access to medical care.   See Pearson v. Prison Health Service , 850 F.3d 526, 535\u201337 \n(3d Cir. 2017).  The test for deliberate indifferen ce is recklessness .  Farmer , 511 U.S. at 839\u201340.   \nAccordingly, allegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a Constitutional \nviolation.  White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d at 108- 09 (citations omitted) .  Moreover, \u201ca prisoner does \nnot have the right \u2018to choose a specific form of medical treatment,\u2019\u201d so long as the treatment \nprovided is reasonable.  Lasko v. Watts , 373 F. App\u2019x. 196, 203 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Harrison \nv. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 138\u2013140 (2d Cir. 2000)).   9 In addition, when a prisoner receives medical care, there is a presumption that the treatment  \nis proper, absent evidence that there was a violation in the standard of care.  Pearson, 850 F.3d at \n535.  Thus, for a prisoner to state  a colorable  Eighth Amendment  claim  based on the receipt of \ninadequate medical care, he must show that the def endant acted with a culpable  state of mind when \nproviding that substandard care.  Id.  Medical expert testimony may be necessary to make out such \na claim when the jury, being comprised of laymen, \u201cwould not be in a position to determine that the particular  treatment or diagnosis fell below a professional standard of care.\u201d  Id.   Doing so is \noften necessary to defeat the presumption that the medical care provided is adequate.  On the other \nhand, because claims based on denied or delayed medical care do not involve any treatment  \nrendered , extrinsic proof is not necessary for the jury to find deliberate indifference.  Id .  All that \nis needed is for the surrounding circumstances to be sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that the delay or denial was motivated by non- medical factors.  Id.  (citing  Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll , \n991 F.2d 64, 68\u201369 (3d Cir. 1993) ). \nFinally, w hen a plaintiff attempts  to hold a state actor liable under \u00a7 1983, he must allege \na policy , practice, o r custom that demonstrates deliberate indifference.  Sample v. Diecks , 885 F.2d \n1099, 1110 (3d Cir. 1989); Miller v. Correctional Med. Sys., Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1126, 1132 (D. Del. 1992).  T herefore, t o establish that CMS and/or CCS are  directly liable for the alle ged \nconstitutional violations, P laintiff \u201cmust provide evidence that there was a relevant  [CMS or CCS]  \npolicy or custom, and that the policy caused the constitutional violation [ Plaintiff] allege[s].\u201d  \nNatale v. Camden Cty. Facility , 318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003) (because respondeat superior or \nvicarious liability cannot be a basis for liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a corporation under \ncontract with the state cannot be held liable for the acts of its employees and agents under those \ntheories).   Assuming the acts of Defendant s\u2019 employee s have violated a person\u2019 s constitutional 10 rights, those acts may be deemed the result of a policy or custom of the entity for whom the \nemployee works, thereby rendering the entity liable under \u00a7 1983, where the inadequacy of \nexisting practice is so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights that the policymaker can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.  See Natale, 318 F.3d at 584 (citations omitted ).  \u201c\u2018Policy is made when a decisionmaker possess[ing] final authority to \nestablish . . . policy with respect to the action issues an official proclamation, policy or edict.\u2019\u201d  Miller v. Corr. Med. Sys., Inc., 802 F. Supp. at  1132 (alteration in original) (quoting Andrews v. \nCity of Philadelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1480 (3d Cir. 1990)).  \u201c Custom, on the other hand, can be \nproven by showing that a given course of conduct, although not specifically endorsed or authorized by law, is so well -settled and permanent as virtually to constitute law. \u201d  Id. (citing Andrews , 895 \nF.2d at 1480; Fletcher v. O \u2019Donnell , 867 F.2d 791, 793\u201394 (3d Cir. 1989)).  \n1) Defendants \u2019 Evidence  \n \nBoth the CMS and CCS Defendants contend that they provided a constitutionally adequate \ncourse of treatment to Plaintiff.   \nEvidence in the  record shows that  in the week following Plaintiff\u2019s initial surgery, the CMS \nDefendants monitored Plaintiff\u2019s vital signs, incision site, and responded to pain and swelling with medication and treatment.  (D.I. 242 at 42\u201351).  When Plaintiff was discharged from the infirmary, \nCMS Defendants  reported him as being in stable condition, prescribed him medications, and \nscheduled a follow -up appointment.  ( Id. at 41).  In deciding where to place Plaintiff within the \nJTVCC , the record shows that CMS personnel  consulted with Defendant Rodgers  to make a \nmedically informed decision  to house Plaintiff in a bottom bunk with an abdominal belt .  (Id. at \n58).  Defendants cite to evidence in the record showing that Plaintiff then re ported a decreased \npain level and increased ability to ambulate.  (Id. at 53).  Defendants also note that after it was 11 discovered that Plaintiff had missed his follow -up appointment, CMS personnel promptly arranged \nto have him scheduled for a new appointme nt.  (Id. at 4).   When a doctor discovered that Plaintiff \nneeded a repeat hydrocelectomy, Defendant Rodgers approved a request for Plaintiff to get that \nsurgery the very same week.  ( Id. at 6).  Citing to the medical file, Defendants contend that they \nproperly monitored and cared for Plaintiff following the corrective surgery, and once again made a medically informed opinion on where Plaintiff should be housed following the surgery.  (Id. at  \n7, 37\u201340).   \nThe CCS Defendants did not submit relevant medical files  about their care of Plaintiff, and \ninstead rest their motion on the notion that Plaintiff cannot produce admissible evidence to support his claim against them.  See F\nED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(1)(B) (permitting a party to assert that a fact \ncannot be genuinely disputed by showing that \u201can adverse party cannot produce admissible \nevidence to support the fact.\u201d).  They contend that \u201cAverill has [] failed to set forth any credible \nevidence that the CCS Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs.\u201d  (D.I.  241 at 16).  Not only do the  CCS Defendants claim that nothing in the record evidence \nsupports Plaintiff\u2019s as sertion that they  exhibited deliberate indifference to his serious medical need, \nthe CCS Defendants assert that they  did not act with deliberate indifference toward Plaintiff.   \nBoth the CMS and CCS Defendants also submitted an  expert report prepared by Dr. David \nM. Albala, a physician who has practiced urology for thirty- one years.  (D.I. 239, Exhibit 1).  \nDr. Albala\u2019s  report opined that \u201cthe medical staff at both HRYCI and JVTCC treated the patient \nin a timely, professional manner.\u201d  ( Id. at 4).  Dr. Albal a explained  that the operation was \nperformed in a proper fashion and that the complications Plaintiff experienced are common to the procedure.  ( Id.).  Dr. Albala contends that those  complications were addressed in an appropriate \nand competent manner  by the Defendants .  (Id.).   12 Defendants have submitted competent evidence showing a campaign of care, treatment, \nand diagnoses .  Moreover, Defendants have  provided an expert\u2019s attestation that th ese efforts met \nthe standard of care and that no party was even negligent , let alone deliberately indifferent .  The \nevidence proffered by the CMS Defendants  satisfies the Court that the  CMS Defendants have made \na prima facie case that they were not deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff\u2019s ser ious medical need s.  \nThe Court is similarly satisfied that the CCS Defendants, by detailing a sparse record and \nsubmitting an expert report who attes ted to the level of care provided by them, have made a prima \nfacie case that they did not violate Plaintiff \u2019s constitutional rights.  \n2) Plaintiff \u2019s Failure to Cite Evidence That  Would Create A Genuine  \nIssue Of Material Fact         \n \nRule 56( c)(1)(A) of the Fe deral Rules of Civil Procedure demands  that a party asserting \nthat a genuine issue of material fact exists \u201c support the assertion by citing to particular parts of \nmaterials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions , interrogatory answers, or other materials.\u201d  The rule omits pleadings as competent \nevidence for opposing a motion for summary judgment and it is clear that a litigant may not rely on its  unsworn pleadings.  See First Nat. Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289 (1968)  \n(\u201cWhat Rule 56(e) does make clear is that a party cannot rest on the allegations contained in his \ncomplaint in opposition to a properly supported summary judgment motion made against him.\u201d); D.E. v. Central Dauphin School Dist. , 765 F.3d 260, 268\u201369 (3d Cir. 2014) (\u201cThe non- moving \nparty must oppose the motion and, in doing so, may not rest upon the mere allegations of his pleadings.\u201d) (citations omitted); Jones v. United Parcel Serv. , 214 F.3d 402, 407 (3d Cir. 2000)  \n(\u201cAt s ummary judgment, a plaintiff cannot rely on unsupported allegations, but must go beyond \npleadings and provide some evidence that would show that there exists a genuine issue for trial.\u201d).  13 Plaintiff\u2019s motion in opposition, however, failed to cite any recor d evidence, and  instead  rested \nentirely on the allegations of his Third Amended Complaint.  ( See D.I. 242 at 3 \u201318).   \nAccordingly, the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment must be granted because the  \nPlaintiff has failed to point to evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact  with \nrespect to whether Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights were violated .  Defendants have  supported their \nposition that they were not deliberately indifferent by pointing to record evidence showing \ntreatment, diagnos es, and care, or by detailing the absence of such evidence to the Court.  In \naddition, Defendants submitted an expert report that claims that the y treated Plaintiff in a manner \nthat did not deviate from the standard of care.  Because Defendants submitted e vidence that would \nentitle them to judgment as a matter of law if uncontested at trial, Plaintiff was obligated to oppose the motion by submitting competent evidence demonstrating that there is a genuine dispute as to \nthe material fact s.  10A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2 727.2 \n(4th ed. 2021).  Because he has  failed to do so, and has instead chosen to rely on the bare assertions \nin his Complaint, the Court must grant Defendant\u2019s motion.\n3 \nMoreover , Plaintiff  did not support his  claim that he received inadequate medical care with \nan expert report  or any other extrinsic evidence.  The Court finds that doing so was necessary.4  \nAs described above, Plaintiff alleged that the CMS Defendants provided him with inadequ ate \nmedical care and, in their motion , the CMS Defendants supplied evidence of the care they \n \n3  The Court notes that Plaintiff is not proceeding pro se  and has been represented by counsel \nfor several years.  \n \n4  As Pearson makes clear, extrinsic proof is not necessary for claims where the plaintiff \nclaims that medical treatment was delayed or denied for a non -medical reason.   850 F.3d \nat 537.  Therefore, this deficiency in Plaintiff\u2019s proofs only affect his  claim that he received \ninadequate medical care, and not his allegations of medical care that was either delayed or \ndenied.  14 administered alongside an expert\u2019s attestation that the ir treatment met the professional standard of \ncare.  Because the jury, as laymen, would not be in a position to determine whether  the CMS \nDefendants\u2019 particular treatment fell below a professional standard of care, Plaintiff was obliged \nto submit an expert report or other extrinsic proof supporting his positions on this point.  See Pearson, 850 F.3d at 536.  He failed to do so.   \nPlaintiff\u2019s proofs  suffer from an additional deficiency with respect to his claims against \nCMS and CCS.  Both entities, who were contracted by the state to provide healthcare to Delaware\u2019s inmates,  are treated as state actors, and  theref ore, as explaine d above, Plaintiff had to show that \npolicy, practice, or custom of these Defendants was the moving force behind the constitutional deprivations he suffered.  Therefore, Plaintiff had  to submit competent evidence of such a policy, \npractice, or custom , but instead rested on his Complaint \u2019s allegations  as evidence.  A gain, a \npleading\u2019s bare allegations  are not evidence , and, a ccordingly, Plaintiff  failed to rebut the prima \nfacie case that CMS and CCS made against him  that there was no such policy. \nIV.
