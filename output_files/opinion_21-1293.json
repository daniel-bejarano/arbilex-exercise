No. 21-1293 (MN)  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n \nAt Wilmington, this 5th day of Apri l 2023: \nThe Court heard arguments for the disputed claim terms of U.S. Patent No. 8,992,989 (\u201cthe \n\u2019989 Patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 9,549,940 (\u201cthe \u2019940 Patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 9,622,983 (\u201cthe \u2019983 \nPatent\u201d) and U.S. Patent No. 10,314,790 (\u201cthe \u2019790 Patent\u201d) on January 11, 2023.1  (See D.I. 111).   \nAs announced at the hearing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the disputed claim terms of the \n\u2019989, \u2019940, \u2019983 and \u2019790 Patent s are construed as follows: \n1. \u201c an extended release (XR) topiramate- containing component \u201d means \u201ca \ncomponent that releases topiramate o ver a prolonged period of time,\u201d with \nthe clarification that \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d means \u201ca continuous period \nof time of greater than about 1 hour.\u201d   (\u2019989 Patent, c laims 14 & 18; \u2019940 \nPatent, claims 14 & 18; \u2019983 Patent, claims 13 & 17) ;  \n \n2. \u201c at least two extended release (XR) topiramate- containing components\u201d \nmeans  \u201cat least two  components that release topiramate over a prolonged \nperiod of time, each component having a different release rate.\u201d  (\u2019790 Patent, claims 1 & 12). \n \n \n1  The parties presented no agreed -upon constructions.  ( See D.I. 94 at 3 ).  2 The parties briefe d the issues (D.I. 94) and submitted an appendix containing intrinsic and \nextrinsic evidence.  (D.I. 95).  The Court carefully reviewed all submissions in connection with \nthe parties\u2019 contentions regarding the disputed claim terms, heard oral argument ( see D.I. 111) and \napplied the legal standards below in reaching its decision. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n574 U.S. 318, 325 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide subst antial \nguidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim must also be considered.   Id. at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire  patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to 3 limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad , Inc. , 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The pros ecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic \nevidence,  . . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and \nTrademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d  Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1317.  \u201c[T]h e prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language \nby demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id.   \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the releva nt time period.\u201d  Teva , 574 U.S. at 331. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the p ertinent field.\u201d  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intr insic evidence.\u201d  Id.   Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay 4 be useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201cis unlikely \nto result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe Court\u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim terms of the  \u2019989, \u2019940, \u2019983 and \u2019790 \nPatents  was announced during the Markman hearing on January 11, 2023 as follows: \nAt issue th ere are two disputed claim terms in four patents : \nU.S. Patent Nos. 8,992,989, 9,549,940, 9,622,983, and 10,314,790.   \nI am prepared to rule on each of the disputes.  I will not be issuing a \nwritten opinion, but I will issue an order stating my rulings.  I want \nto emphasize before I announce my decisions that although I am not issuing a written opinion, we have followed a full and thorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.  I have reviewed the patent s and all of the evidence submitted by the parties.  \nThere was full briefing on each of the disputed terms and we had argument today.  All of that has been carefully considered.  \nAs to my rulings, I am not going to read into the record my \nunderstanding of claim construction law.  I have a legal standard \nsection that I have included in earlier opinions, including recently in Rex Computing, Inc. v. Cerebras Systems Inc., C ivil Action  No. 21-\n525 (MN).  I incorporate that law and adopt it into my ruling today \nand will also set it out in the order that I issue.  \n Initially, let me note that the briefing in th is case was not a \nmodel of clarity.  I do appreciate the parties\u2019 attempts to limit the \npatents and claims being asserted, but the [joint] brief largely did \nnot cite to the specific ations of the patents currently before me and \nthe joint appendix did not even contain most of the patents before me.  I understand that the specifications of the patents are largely the same as ones cited, but it seems to be a pretty big failure to  not \nensure that I have the patents and the claims that you want me to \naddress in the papers submitted. \n \n  5 The first term is \u201can extended release (XR) topiramate-\ncontaining component\u201d in claims 14 and 18 of the \u2019989 Patent, \nclaims 14 and 18 of the \u2019940 Patent, and c laims 13 and 17 of the \n\u2019983 Patent.  Plaintiff argues no construction is necessary, but in the \nalternative proposes the construction \u201ca component that releases \ntopiramate over a prolonged period of time.\u201d  Defendants propose \nthe construction \u201cat least two populations of extended release \ntopiramate containing beads.\u201d  I am going to adopt Plaintiff\u2019s construction with a slight clarification.  \n Defendants propose two additional limitations to the claim \nlanguage:  1) that the XR component must be comprised of beads and 2) that there must be at least two populations of those beads.  I\u2019ll take these in order.  \n With respect to beads, nothing in the claim language requires \nthat the claims should be limited to beads.  Instead, the claims refer to an XR component that comprises a coating material.\n[2]  \nDefendants, however, argue that [ \u00e0] la Phillips[3] the intrinsic \nevidence \u2013 in terms of the specification and the prosecution of the \nparent \u2019576 P atent[4] \u2013 only describes release controlling coatings in \nthe context of beads and never discusses coatings in terms of tablets or other dosage forms.  For the most part, Defendants cite to what the specification clearly refers to as embodiments that use beads.\n[5]  \nThe specification, however, also discloses an embodiment that is a \nmultilayer tablet rather than beads and there is no suggestion that a \nmultilayer tablet would exclude use of coatings or coating \nmaterial.[6]  With respect to the statements in the prosecution history \nof the parent application, those statements were simply distinguishing the particular claims at issue \u2013 all of which claimed \n \n2  (E.g., \u2019989 Patent  at 21:5 -8).  \n \n3  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005)  (en banc) .  \n \n4  (U.S. Patent No. 8,298,576 (\u201c the \u2019576 Patent\u201d) ).  \n \n5  (E.g., \u2019790 Patent at 2:66- 3:11, 6:55- 61 & 11:60- 12:10).  The parties state that the \nspecifications of the \u2019790, \u2019989, \u2019940 & \u2019983 Patents as well as that of U.S. Patent No. \n8,663,683 are substantially identical  and cite to them interchangeably .  (See D.I. 94 at 12 \nn.6).  \n \n6  (E.g., \u2019 989 Patent at  11:13- 20).  6 beads.[7]  And I do not view those as limiting the claims here which \ndo not  specify beads.  \n \nWith respect to the proposed limitation that the XR \ncomponent claimed actual ly means two XR components, \nDefendants argue that there was a disclaimer of claim scope in the \nprosecution of the parent \u2019576 P atent application.  The standard for \nfinding a disclaimer is a high one.[8]  It requires finding that the \nstatements relied on are clear and unmistakable.[9]  If the statements \nare ambiguous or amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations, \nthere is no disclaimer.[10] \n There is no question that a patentee generally has the right to \nfile a continuation application and attempt to broaden its claims.\n[11]  \nDefendants, however, argue that Plaintiff cannot do so here, because of disclaimers during the prosecution of the parent application.  First, Defendants argue that in response to a restriction requirement, \nPlaintiff elected two populations of XR beads and one population of [immediate release]  beads to serve as the starting point for the \nExaminer\u2019s search.\n[12]  As Plaintiff points out, however, the claims \nfor the \u2019576 P atent \u2013 at the relevant times during prosecution and \nafter patent issuance \u2013 expressly claimed a formulation having at \nleast two populations of [XR] beads.[13] \n Similarly, Defendants argue that during the prosecution of \nthe \u2019576 P atent, Plaintiff distinguished prior a rt on the basis that the \nprior art had a uniform XR component ( e.g., a single bead or granule \npopulation).\n[14]  Again, however, the claims at issue in that \n \n7  (See D.I. 95, Ex. I at SUPTXR0001288- 89 & Ex. K at SUPTXR0002275, \nSUPTXR0002278).  \n8  See Avid Tech., Inc. v. Harmonic , Inc., 812 F.3d 1040, 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2016) . \n \n9  Omega  Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1325- 26 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \n \n10  See C ordis  Corp. v. Medtronic  AVE, Inc., 339 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \n \n11  Hakim  v. Cannon Avent Grp., PLC , 479 F.3d 1313, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \n  \n12  (D.I. 94 at 9- 10 (citing D.I. 95, Ex. I at SUPTXR0001288- 89)).  \n \n13  (D.I. 95, Ex J at SUPTXR0002200; \u2019 576 Patent at 19: 50-55).  \n \n14  (D.I. 94 at 10 (citing D.I 95, Ex. K at SUPTXR0002275, SUPTXR0002278)).  7 application expressly claimed an extended releas e component  made \nup of two populations of beads.[15]  The claims here do not. \n \nAnd finally, Defendants argue that each of the asserted \npatents was initially rejected for obviousness -type double patenting \nand in each instance the Examiner understood the scope of the claims to be limited to at least two populations of XR topiramate -\ncontaining beads.  Defendants fail ed to show why this indicates that \nthe scope of the asserted patents must be the same as that of the parent patent , particularly given that the relevant clai m language is \ndifferent and the Examiner noted that the claim scope was not exactly the same.\n[16]  \n \nI do not find that Plaintiff\u2019s statements during the parent \nprosecution either alone or in combination are clear and \nunmistakable disavowals of claim scope for claims that included \ndifferent and broader language that did not require two XR \ncomponents.   \n Moreover, I think that it was clear to the Examiner that in \nthe later prosecutions Plaintiff changed the scope of the claims to \ninclude only one XR component.  Plaintiff, for example, removed \nthe language about two components and  also included claims  in \nother continuation applications that referred to having \u201cat least one\u201d \nXR component.\n[17]  These changes were supported by the \nspecification, which describes, for example in Table 5, formulations having just one XR component.\n[18]   And there is no indication that \nthe Examiner was relying on those earlier statements.  Indeed, unlike in Hakim , which Defendants rely on here, the Examiner of the \npatents at issue here did not simply accept the new application and new claims presented, but  conducted additional review and \nprosecution of the applications.\n[19]  \n \n \n15  (D.I. 95, Ex J at SUPTXR0002200; \u2019576 Patent at 19:50- 55 (claiming \u201c[a] sustained release \nformulation . . . comprising an immediate release bead population (IR), a first extended release bead population (XR1), and a second extended release bead population (XR2) \u201d)).  \n16  (See D.I. 95, Ex. BB at SUP TXR0005541- 42).  \n \n17  (E.g., \u2019989 Patent at 20: 19-20 (claiming an XR component \u201ccontained in at least one \npopulation of beads\u201d) ).  \n \n18  (See \u2019989 Patent at t bl.5).  \n \n19  Hakim v. Cannon Avent Grp., PLC , 479 F.3d 1313, 1317- 18 (Fed. Cir. 2007).   8 Finally, in the briefing Defendants took issue with Plaintiff\u2019s \nconstruction, arguing that there is no floor to \u201cprolonged period of \ntime.\u201d  There was not any argument about that here today.  As Plaintiff points out, however, the specification defines \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d as \u201ca continuous period of time of greater than about \n1 hour.\u201d\n[20]  I understand that that definition appears in the context \nof differentiating between a \u201csustai ned release\u201d formulation and an \n\u201cimmediate release formulation,\u201d but I credit the opinion of \nPlaintiff\u2019s expert that a POSA would understand \u201cextended release . . . component\u201d to be consistent with the defined terms.\n[21]  \nTherefore, I will adopt Plaintiff\u2019 s construction with the clarification \nthat \u201cprolonged period of time\u201d means \u201ca continuous period of time \nof greater than about 1 hour.\u201d  \n \nThe second term is \u201cat least two  extended  release (XR) \ntopiramate -containing components\u201d in claims 1 and 12 of the \u2019790 \nPatent.   Plaintiff argues no construction is necessary, but in the \nalternative proposes the construction \u201cat least two extended release topiramate -containing components having in vitro release rates for \ntopiramate.\u201d   Defendants propose the construction \u201cat least t wo \ndifferent extended release (XR) topiramate -containing bead \npopulations.\u201d   I am going to construe this term to mean \u201c [at least] \ntwo components  that release topiramate over a prolonged period of \ntime, each component having a different release rate.\u201d    \n \nTo the extent that Defendants propose that the claim is \nlimited to bead forms, I reject that for the reasons previously stated.   \n \nAs for the two XR components having different release \nprofiles, I think that that is supported by the intrinsic evidence.  I \nunderstand that the claim does not use the word \u201cdifferent ,\u201d but it \ndoes specify that there are two XR components .  And the \nspecification describes XR components comprising a population of beads and states that there is a specific release controlling coatin g \nfor each population.\n[22]  That is, the release f or each population \nwould be different because it has a different coating.  And that is what is disclosed, for example, in Table 5, which describes XR \n \n20  (\u2019989 Patent at  3:47- 48).  \n \n21  (See D.I. 95, Ex. B \u204b\u204b 28 -30).  \n \n22  (\u2019790 Patent at 2:35- 41). \n  9 \ncomponents having different releases when there are mult iple XR \ncomponents.
