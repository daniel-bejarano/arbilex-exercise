(\u201cCCSP\u201d) and Herman M. Ellis, M.D. (\u201cDr. Ellis\u201d), and accept an\n\naffidavit of merit! as timely filed nunc pro tunc (D.I. 14),? IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that\n\n' In Delaware, medical negligence is governed by the Delaware Health Care Negligence\nInsurance and Litigation Act, 18 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 6801-6865, and requires a party alleging medical\nnegligence to produce an affidavit of merit with expert medical testimony. See Bonesmo v.\nNemours Found. , 253 F. Supp. 2d 801, 804 (D. Del. 2003).\n\n2 The briefing for the pending motion is as follows: Plaintiffs motion and opening brief (D.I.\n14), Dr. Ellis\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 15), and Plaintiffs reply brief (D.I. 23). The parties title the\nmotion and briefing as follows: \u201cPlaintiff's Motion Concerning Defendant Herman M. Ellis\u2019s\nMotion to Dismiss,\u201d \u201cHerman M. Ellis, M.D.\u2019s Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion Concerning\nDefendant Herman M. Ellis\u2019s Motion to Dismiss,\u201d and \u201cPlaintiff's Reply Brief to Defendant\nEllis\u2019 July 5, 2021 Answering Brief.\u201d The parties are far from clear in identifying Plaintiff's\nrequest for affirmative relief. Plaintiff points to Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b) as the basis for relief.\nHowever, Rule 7(b) only relates to the Form of Motions, not substantive relief. Despite this\nmurky nomenclature, the court treats Plaintiff's motion as a motion to stay and a motion for an\nextension of time to file the affidavit of merit nunc pro tunc. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) (extension\nof time limits).\nGreen\u2019s motion to stay is GRANTED and, accordingly, Green\u2019s motion for an extension of time\nto submit the affidavit of merit is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to renew at such time after\nthe 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a) stay is lifted.\n\n1. Background. On March 23, 2021, Green, individually and as Administratrix of the\nEstate of her son, Julius S. Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d), initiated this action in Delaware Superior Court,\nC.A. No. K21C-03-034 JIC, against defendants CCSP, Dr. Ellis, Dana Metzger (\u201cMetzger\u201d), and\nMarc Richman (\u201cRichman\u201d). (D.I. 1, Ex. A) On May 6, 2021, defendants Metzger and Richman\n(collectively, \u201cDOC Defendants\u201d) filed a notice of removal to this court on the basis of federal\nquestion jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. (D.L. 1, Ex. D)\n\n2. The complaint asserts claims for failure to provide necessary medical treatment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and medical negligence resulting in\nJohnson\u2019s death on July 4, 2019, when he was housed as a pretrial detainee at James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center (\u201cJTVCC\u201d). (D.I. 1, Ex. A) To the extent Green alleges medical negligence\nunder Delaware state law, Green did not file an affidavit of merit along with the complaint filed\nin Delaware Superior Court on March 23, 2021, as required by 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(1). Green\nsubsequently filed an affidavit of merit on May 13, 2021. (D.I. 7) While Dr. Ellis objects to the\ncourt ruling that the affidavit is timely, Green asserts that DOC Defendants do not object. (D.I.\n\n15; DL 14.95)\n\n3 The DOC Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 12, 2021. (D.I. 3) Also on May 12,\n2021, Defendant Dr. Ellis filed a motion to dismiss incorporating the arguments of DOC\nDefendants in addition to arguments specific to the claims asserted against him, primarily\nPlaintiff's failure to attach an affidavit of merit to the complaint. (DJ. 5) The court concurrently\nissued a Report and Recommendation addressing the DOC Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\nHowever, due to the bankruptcy stay, the court denied Dr. Ellis\u2019 motion to dismiss, without\nprejudice to renew.\n3. Defendant CCSP filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 19, 2021 and filed a\nSuggestion of Bankruptcy in Delaware Superior Court on April 28, 2021. (D.I. 1, Ex. C) On\nJune 25, 2021, Green filed the motion to stay currently before the court. (D.I. 14) Defendant\nCCSP filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy in this court on July 30, 2021, after the case was\nremoved.\u2019 (D.I. 21)\n\n4. Legal Standard. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), the filing of a voluntary petition\nunder Chapter 11 operates as an automatic stay to legal proceedings against the entity and its\nemployees. Specifically, Section 362(a)(1) stays \u201cthe commencement or continuation...of a\njudicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have\nbeen commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim\nagainst the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title.\u201d Although\nthe language of Section 362(a)(1) appears to stay actions only against the \u201cdebtor,\u201d courts have\nextended the automatic stay to nonbankrupt codefendants in \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d where\n\u201cactions against the debtor and arguably against those whose interests are so intimately\nintertwined with those of the debtor that the latter may be said to be the real party in interest.\u201d\nA.H. Robins Co., Inc. v. Piccinin, 788 F.2d 994, 1001 (4th Cir. 1986); See also McCartney v.\nIntegra Nat. Bank North, 106 F.3d 506, 510 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n5. Furthermore, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a), \u201c[t]he court may issue any order, process, or\njudgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of [Title 11].\u201d Pursuant to\nthe court\u2019s equitable powers under Section 105, \u201cthe Court may issue or extend stays to enjoin a\n\nvariety of proceedings [including discovery against the debtor or its officers and employees]\n\n4 Subsequent to filing its Suggestion of Bankruptcy, CCSP\u2019s bankruptcy converted from Chapter\n11 to Chapter 7 on September 27, 2021. (See 21-10723-MFW, Bankr. Docket No. 537)\n\n3\nwhich will have an adverse impact on the Debtor\u2019s ability to formulate a Chapter 11 plan.\u201d A.H.\nRobins Co., 788 F.2d at 1001 (quoting In re Johns-Manville Corp., 40 B.R. 219, 225-26 (S.D.\nN.Y. 1984)).\n\n6. Analysis. Green requests that this court both accept the affidavit of merit filed on\nMay 13, 2021 as timely and stay this case against defendants CCSP and Dr. Ellis until the\nSection 362(a) stay is lifted. (D.I. 14) Green asserts that she inadvertently omitted filing the\naffidavit of merit with the complaint on March 23, 2021, but that the Superior Court\nProthonotary should have refused the complaint pursuant to 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(3). (Ud. at J 1)\nGreen further asserts that, had the complaint been refused, she could have remedied the issue by\nrefiling the complaint in Delaware Superior Court or by filing a separate civil complaint with the\naffidavit of merit once the case was removed to this court. (/d. at ]3) Additionally, Green\nargues that, but for the stay in this case, she could have filed an amended complaint. (/d.)\nRegardless, Green asserts that the statute of limitations had not run by the time she filed the\naffidavit of merit on May 13, 2021. (dd. at \u00a7 2)\n\n7. Green contends that the case should be stayed as to CCSP and Dr. Ellis. (D.I. 14)\nGreen argues that Dr. Ellis was an agent or employee of CCSP, and CCSP was ultimately\nresponsible for Dr. Ellis\u2019 medical treatment of Johnson. (D.I. 1, Ex. A at ff 16-18; D.I. 14 at \u00a5 2;\nD.I. 23 at 1) Therefore, the filing of CCSP\u2019s voluntary petition under Chapter 11 operates as a\nstay of the litigation as to CCSP and Dr. Ellis. (/d.)\n\n8. In response, Dr. Ellis first argues that, to the extent Green alleges medical negligence,\nGreen violated 18 Del. C. \u00a7 6853(a)(1) because she failed to submit an affidavit of merit upon\nfiling the complaint. (D.I. 15 at FJ] 12-14) Dr. Ellis also argues that Green\u2019s motion to stay is a\n\nprocedurally improper sur-reply to his motion to dismiss because it does not address any new\nissues or legal bases first asserted in Dr. Ellis\u2019 reply brief and Green failed to file the required\nmotion for an extension of time by which to file the late affidavit of merit. (/d. at [] 6-12)\n\n9. Dr. Ellis next argues that the bankruptcy stay applies only to CCSP. (/d. at \u00a217) Dr.\nEllis, however, does not address application of the stay to CCSP employees, such as himself.\nInstead, he simply asserts that the bankruptcy stay in its present form does not apply to him.\n(Id.) Dr. Ellis also notes that Green waited nearly two months after CCSP filed a Suggestion of\nBankruptcy to file the motion to stay, which allowed full briefing on the merits of her complaint.\n(Ud. at JJ 21-22) Dr. Ellis is amenable to staying the litigation against him, but requests that the\ncourt first rule on his pending motion to dismiss. (/d. at \u00a7 23; see D.I. 5)\n\n10. Pursuant to Section 362(a), the filing of CCSP\u2019s voluntary petition under Chapter 11\noperates as a stay to legal proceedings against CCSP and its employees. (D.I. 1, Ex. C) Green\u2019s\ncomplaint, motion, and reply brief allege that Dr. Ellis was an agent or employee of CCSP. (D.I.\n1 at FJ 16-18; D.L. 14 at \u00a7 2; DI. 23 at 1) Despite these references to his employment, Dr. Ellis\ndoes not address or dispute in his answering brief whether he was a CCSP employee. This is not\nthe first time Dr. Ellis has been named a defendant as an employee of CCSP in a civil rights case\nbrought by a state prison inmate. See, e.g., Evans v. Sexton, C.A. No. 16-598-RGA, 2020 WL\n1814772, at *1 (D. Del. Apr. 9, 2020) (civil rights and medical negligence action brought against\nDr. Ellis and co-defendants employed by CCSP, however, the state law medical negligence count\nagainst the defendant doctors employed by CCSP was ultimately dismissed without opposition\nby the plaintiff due to the lack of an affidavit of merit). Moreover, accepting the allegations in\nthe complaint as true, Dr. Ellis was a CCSP employee at all times relevant to the suit, Asa\nCCSP employee, Dr. Ellis\u2019 interests are intimately intertwined with those of CCSP, and\n\ndiscovery against Dr. Ellis has the potential to adversely impact CCSP\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\nSee A.H. Robins Co., 788 F.2d at 1001. Thus, Sections 362(a) and 105(a) extend CCSP\u2019s\nautomatic stay to its employees, including Dr. Ellis.\n\n11. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, Green\u2019s motion to stay this case against\ndefendants CCSP and Dr. Ellis is GRANTED until the Section 362(a) stay is lifted. (D.I. 14)\nBoth Dr. Ellis\u2019 pending motion to dismiss (D.I. 5) and Green\u2019s motion for the court to accept the\naffidavit of merit as timely (D.I. 14) are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to renew at such\ntime after the Section 362(a) stay is lifted.\n\n12.
