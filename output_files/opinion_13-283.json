INTRODUCTION\nPending before the Coutt is a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254 and two amended Petitions (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cPetition\u201d filed by\nPetitioner Paul Edward Weber (\u201cPetitioner\u201d). (D.I. 1; D.L. 58; D.I. 63; D.I. 113) The Petition\npresents 17 claims for relief based on alleged violations of several federal constitutional principles\nand the alleged misinterpretation and misapplication of Delaware sentencing law. \u2018The State filed\nAnswers in Opposition, to which Petitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 12; DI. 77; D.I. 94; D.I. 105) For\nthe reasons discussed, the Coutt will dismiss the Petition because the claims are either meritless,\nptocedurally barred, or not cognizable on federal habeas review.\nIL. BACKGROUND\nIn 2001, 2 Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of second degree forgery and\nmisdemeanor theft due to his forgery of a check for $300. See Weber v. State, 812 A.2d 225 (Table),\n2002 WL 31235418, at *1 (Del. Oct. 4, 2002); Weber v. State, 197 A.3d 492 (Table), 2018 WL\n5993473, at *1 (Del. Nov. 13, 2018). The Superior Court sentenced him to 30 days of imprisonment\nat Level V for each conviction. See Weber, 2002 WL 31235418, at *1. Petitioner appealed his\nconvictions and sentences to the Delaware Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction because Petitioner\u2019s term of imprisonment for each conviction did not exceed one\nmonth. See zd.\nThereafter, on August 18, 2004,\nat apptoximately 10:00 p.m., 74 year old Frederick Naspo stopped to\nrefuel his car at the Shell gas station on the corner of Kirkwood\nHighway and Duncan Road, in New Castle County. As Naspo got out\nto pump gas, a man with a cigarette behind his eat approached him at\n\nthe pump. Naspo said, \u201cGood evening,\u201d and asked the man whether\nhe intended to smoke neat the gas pump. According to Naspo, the\nman teplied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to take your car.\u201d With both hands, the\nman grabbed for Naspo\u2019s cat keys, twice telling Naspo that he had a\ngun. Failing to get the cat keys, the man ran away. Naspo had the gas\nstation attendant call the police.\n\nAt 10:13 p.m., Delaware State Police Sergeant Mark Hawk responded\nto the Shell gas station and met with Naspo. Naspo told Hawk that\nhis assailant was a white male, about 35 years old and approximately\nfive feet eight inches tall, 160 pounds, wearing jeans and a loose fitting\nblue shit. While speaking with Naspo, Hawk learned that police had\na suspect detained in the parking lot of a nearby Sleepy\u2019s mattress store,\nabout a block and a half away. The suspect appeated to match Naspo\u2019s\ndescription of his assailant.\n\nHawk drove Naspo to the Sleepy\u2019s parking lot for a showup\nidentification of the detained suspect, who was [Petitioner], a man\nwhom Hawk had encountered several times before, dating back to\n1984. Naspo viewed [Petitioner] from the backseat of Hawk\u2019s patrol\nvehicle. To Naspo, it appeared that [Petitioner] wore military fatigues;\nhowever, at trial Hawk testified that [Petitioner] had worn blue jeans\nand an oversized blue shirt. Unconvinced that [Petitioner] was his\nassailant, Naspo told police that [Petitioner] was not the man that\nassaulted him. Police released [Petitioner] and drove him home.\n\nThat same night, Hawk interviewed the Shell gas station attendant and\nlearned that the gas station had a video surveillance system. Because\nthe attendant did not have access to the surveillance system, Hawk\nwould have to return in the morning to view the tapes. On August 19,\n2004, at around 10:00 a.m., Hawk returned to the gas station and\nviewed the video surveillance tape. Upon reviewing the footage, Hawk\nrecognized that Naspo\u2019s assailant was [Petitioner]. Hawk testified that\nthe man in the video had the same facial features as [Petitioner], and\nwore the same clothing Petitioner had worn when he was detained in\nthe Sleepy\u2019s parking lot: an oversized blue shirt and blue jeans.\n\nHawk went to [Petitioner\u2019s] residence with an arrest wartant and\nattested [Petitioner] in his bedroom. At the time, [Petitioner] wore\nnothing but his underwear, so Hawk grabbed a pair of blue jeans and\na blue shirt from the floor of [Petitioner\u2019s] bedroom. The police\ntransported [Petitioner] to Troop 2 for booking and processing.\n\nWeber v. State, 38 A.3d 271, 273-74 (Del. 2012).\nPetitioner was indicted on charges of attempted first degree robbery and attempted first\ndegtee carjacking. See Weber v. State, 971 A.2d 135, 140 (Del. 2009). In 2005, a Delaware Superior\nCoutt juty convicted him of both charges, and he was sentenced as an habitual offender to a total of\n28 yeats of imprisonment at Level V (25 years for the robbety conviction and three years for the\ncarjacking conviction). See id. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s\nconviction for attempted first degree carjacking, but reversed his conviction for attempted first\ndegree robbery, and remanded the case back to the Superior Court for a new trial. See id. at 142\n(hereinafter \u201cWeber I\u2019). In 2010, the State retried Petitioner for attempted first degree robbery, and a\nDelaware Superior Court jury convicted him of that offense. See Weber v. State, 38 A.3d 271, 274\n(Del. 2012) (hereinafter \u201cWeber IP\u2019). The State moved to declare Petitioner an habitual offender, and\nthe Superior Court granted that motion following a hearing. See zd. Petitioner\u2019s felony conviction in\n2001 for forging a $300 check served as one of the predicate offenses for Petitioner\u2019s habitual\noffender status. See Weber, 2018 WL 5993473, at *1. Petitioner was subsequently sentenced to 25\nyeats of imprisonment at Level V for the robbery conviction. The Delaware Supreme Coutt\naffirmed Petitionet\u2019s convictions and sentence on February 21, 2012. See Weber II, 38 A.3d at 278.\nPetitioner petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which the Supreme\nCourt denied on October 1, 2012. See Weber v. Delaware, 568 U.S. 865 (2012).\n\nIn February 2013, the attorney who represented Petitioner in his Delaware criminal trial and\ndirect appeal (\u201cdefense counsel\u201d) filed the first Petition in this proceeding, which asserted eight\nclaims for relief. (D.I. 1) On August 6, 2013, Petitioner, acting pro st, filed in the Delaware Superiot\nCourt a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61\n(\u2018Rule 61 motion\u201d), alleging that defense counsel was ineffective at trial and on direct appeal. (D.L\n11-4) Petitioner, however, informed the Superior Coutt that he wished defense counsel to continue\n\n3\nteptesenting him in the instant federal habeas proceeding. Id. The State filed a motion to stay the\ninstant proceeding due to the possible conflict of interest and also filed an Answer to the original\npetition. (D.I. 11; D.I. 12) Defense counsel filed a reply opposing a stay. (D.I. 15) After\nconsidering additional briefing, the Honorable Sue L. Robinson (now retired) granted the motion to\nstay on July 1, 2014. (D.I. 21) Recognizing the conflict of interest caused by defense counsel\u2019s\nteptesentation of Petitioner in his Rule 61 proceeding, the Delaware Superior Coutt stayed\nPetitioner\u2019s Rule 61 proceeding and attempted to appoint conflict counsel to represent Petitioner.\n(D.I. 78-1 at 33-34, Entry Nos. 204, 205)\n\nIn June 2015, defense counsel filed in this Court a document titled \u201cPetition for\nExpungement via Habeas Corpus, Coram Nobis, and/or Audita Querala\u201d (\u201cpetition for\nexpungement\u201d) which initiated the opening of another civil action. See Weber v. Pierce, 2015 WL\n7306119, at *1 (D. Del. Oct. 29, 2015). In the petition for expungement, defense counsel argued\nthat Petitioner\u2019s 2001 second degtee forgery conviction was unconstitutional and should not have\nbeen used to enhance Petitionet\u2019s 2010 sentence for attempted fitst degree robbery. Id Judge\nRobinson denied the petition for expungement for two reasons: (1) the Court did not have\njurisdiction to issue a writ of coram nobis or a writ of audita querela for Petitioner\u2019s 2001 Delawate\nforgery conviction, because those writs ate generally limited to challenging federal convictions; and\n(2) the Coutt lacked jurisdiction over the proceeding to the extent the expungement petition was\nbrought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, because Petitioner was no longer \u201cin custody\u201d for the 2001\nforgery conviction. See zd.\n\nMeanwhile, defense counsel continued to file motions in Petitioner\u2019s Delawate state post-\nconviction proceedings in an attempt to challenge the use of his forgery conviction as a predicate\noffense that qualified him as an habitual offender. The Superior Court denied all of those motions,\n\n4\n(DL. 77 at 1-2), and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed those decisions. See Weber v. State, 113\nA.3d 1081 (Table), 2015 WL 2329160 (Del. May 12, 2015). Thereafter, acting pro se, Petitioner\nsought a writ of mandamus from the Delaware Supreme Court to order the Superior Coutt to allow\nhim to successfully challenge his 2001 second degtee forgery conviction. See Matter of Weber, 189\nA.3d 184 (Table), 2018 WL 2446803 (Del. May 30, 2018). The Delaware Supreme Court dismissed\nhis mandamus petition. Id.\n\nIn April 2016, the Superior Court appointed conflict counsel to represent Petitioner in his\nRule 61 proceeding. (D.I. 78-1 at 40-41, Entry No. 269) Conflict counsel filed an amended Rule 61\nmotion on Match 24, 2017. (D.I. 78-1 at 42, Entry No. 281) The Superior Court denied the\namended Rule 61 motion on Match 6, 2018, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndecision on November 13, 2018. (D.I. 78-9; D.I. 78-11; see also Weber v. State, 2018 WL 5993473\n(Del. Nov. 13, 2018).\n\nOn February 28, 2019, the Court lifted the stay in this case. (D.I. 52) Petitioner filed an\namended Petition on April 10, 2019, and then filed a motion to amend the amended Petition on\nApril 16, 2019. (D.I. 58; D.I. 63) The Court granted the motion to amend, and ordered the State to\nanswer the issues in the original Petition, the amended Petition, and the second amended Petition.\n(DL. 65) The State filed its Answer on September 6, 2019. (D.I.77) Thereafter, Petitioner filed\neight discovery-like motions; the Court granted only Petitionet\u2019s Motion to Expand the Record.\n(D1. 74; D.I. 92) After granting the Motion to Expand the Record, the Court ordered the State to\nfile a supplemental Answer to Claim Thirteen of the Petition and any claim related to related to\nDelawate Supreme Coutt orders issued in 2019. (D.I. 92) The State filed a Supplemental Answet\n\non February 3, 2020. (D.I. 94) Petitioner filed a Traverse on June 1, 2020. (D.I. 105)\nIII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES\nA. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the\npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b);\nO'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). The\nAEDPA states, in pertinent part:\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in\ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State coutt shall not be granted\n\nunless it appeats that \u2014\n\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of\nthe State; or\n\n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; ot\n(i) circumstances exist that tender such process ineffective to\nprotect the rights of the applicant.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).\nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to give\n\u201cstate courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete\ntound of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O \u2018Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45; see also\nWerts v. Vanghn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). A petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement\nby demonstrating that the habeas claims were \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state\u2019s highest court, either\non direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court to\nconsider the claims on their metits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples,\n489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989).\nA petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules\n\npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts. See Lines \u00bb. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 3d\nCir. 2000); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 297-98 (1989). Although treated as technically exhausted,\nsuch claims ate nonetheless ptocedurally defaulted. See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160; Coleman v. Thompson,\n501 U.S. 722, 750-51 (1991). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state\u2019s highest\ncoutt, but that court \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d refuses to teview the merits of the claim due to an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted but procedurally defaulted.\nSee Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-64 (1989).\n\nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedutally defaulted claims unless the\npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting\ntherefrom, ot that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the\nclaims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 260 (3d Cit. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To\ndemonstrate cause for a procedural default, a petitioner must show that \u201csome objective factor\nexternal to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d\nMurray \u00bb. Carrier, 417 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show\n\u201cthat [the etrots at trial] worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial\nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d Id. at 494.\n\nAlternatively, a federal court may excuse a ptocedural default if the petitioner demonstrates\nthat failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v.\nCarpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001). A petitioner\ndemonstrates a miscartiage of justice by showing a \u201cconstitutional violation has probably resulted in\nthe conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. Actual innocence means\nfactual innocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bous/ey v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). In\notder to establish actual innocence, the petitioner must present new teliable evidence \u2014 not\npresented at trial \u2014 that demonstrates \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have\n\n7\nfound petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d House \u00bb, Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 537-38 (2006); see\nalso Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522-24 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\nIf a state\u2019s highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the federal court\ntnust review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if the state court\u2019s decision was\n\u201ccontrary to, ot involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or the state court\u2019s decision was an\nunteasonable determination of the facts based on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412 (2000); Appel v. Horn, 250 F.3d 203,\n210 (3d Cir. 2001). A claim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2254(d) if the state court decision finally resolves the claim on the basis of its substance, tather\nthan on a procedural ot some other ground. See Thomas v. Horn, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (Gd Cir. 2009).\nThe deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) applies even \u201cwhen a state court\u2019s order is unaccompanied by\nan opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98\n(2011). As recently explained by the Supreme Coutt, \u201cit may be presumed that the state court\nadjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural\nprinciples to the contrary.\u201d Id. at 99.\n\nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the state court\u2019s\ndeterminations of factual issues ate correct. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This presumption of\ncottectness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is only rebutted by clear and\nconvincing evidence to the contrary. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Campbell \u00bb. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280,\n286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-E/ v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341 (2003) (stating that clear and convincing\n\n8\nstandard in \u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies to factual issues, wheteas unteasonable application standard of\n\u00a7 2254(d)(2) applies to factual decisions).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Coutt views the \u201cPetition\u201d for habeas relief in this case as consisting of the original\nPetition (D.I. 1), the first Amended Petition (D.I. 58), the second Amended Petition (D.I. 63), and\nthe Supplement to Petitioner\u2019s second Amended Petition expanding on Claim Twelve (D.I. 113).\nThe Petition asserts the following 17 grounds for relief: (1) the Delaware Supreme Court violated\nPetitionet\u2019s right to be protected from double jeopardy by remanding his attempted first degree\ntobbery charge rather than acquitting him on that charge; (2) the State engaged in prosecutorial\nmisconduct which denied Petitioner his right to due process and a fait trial; (3) the Superior Court\u2019s\nimpropet voir dire and colloquy about Petitionet\u2019s potential defenses and intent to testify violated his\ntight to due process and a fair trial; (4) Petitioner was denied his right to \u201cjury lenity\u201d because the\njuty evaluating the attempted robbery chatge was not made aware of Petitioner\u2019s conviction for\ncatjacking; (5) there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (6) the Superior Court violated\nPetitioner\u2019s due process/ fair trial right and his right to be protected against double jeopardy by\ngiving incomplete jury instructions on the elements of the offenses; (7) the Superior Court violated\nPetitioner\u2019s due process tight to a fair trial and his right to be protected against double jeopardy by\ngiving incomplete jury instructions on Petitioner\u2019s possible defenses; (8) the cumulative punishments\nimposed for Petitionet\u2019s attempted first degree carjacking and attempted first degree robbery\nconvictions violated his right to be protected from double jeopardy; (9) the plea bargain negotiations\ndeprived Petitioner of his right to a fair trial, and also subjected him to selective ot vindictive\nprosecution; (10) there was insufficient evidence to suppott the identification of Petitioner, and the\n\nState engaged in a suggestive identification process; (11) the State breached its duty to preserve\n\n9\nevidence; (12) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance and violated Petitionet\u2019s right to client\nautonomy by failing to pursue a renunciation defense and/or request a renunciation instruction;\n(13) Petitioner was deprived of his right to due process because he could not challenge his 2001\nconviction for second degree forgery; (14) Petitioner\u2019s inability to challenge his 2001 conviction for\nsecond degtee forgery violated his right to equal protection because the forgery offense could have\nbeen prosecuted as a misdemeanot offense; (15) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by\nincorrectly advising Petitioner that he was not eligible for treatment as an habitual offender;\n(16) Petitionet\u2019s conviction for attempted robbery did not qualify him for treatment as an habitual\noffender; and (17) defense counsel\u2019s general ineffective assistance deprived Petitioner of his tights to\na fair trial, due process, and equal protection.\n\nA. Claim One: Double Jeopardy\n\nIn Claim One, Petitioner contends that his right to be protected from double jeopardy was\nviolated when the Delaware Supreme Coutt remanded his first degree robbery charge back to the\nSuperior Coutt rather than acquitting him on that charge. According to Petitioner, the Delaware\nSupreme Coutt\u2019s reversal of his attempted robbery conviction in Weber amounted to an acquittal\nand batted his retrial on the charge of attempted robbery. He specifically contends that: (1) double\njeopardy bats a retrial where the State initially fails to present insufficient evidence of guilt; and\n(2) the \u201cDelaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s finding that there was sufficient evidence to support an acquittal\nof the offense amounts to a de facto acquittal, . .. and is the equivalent of a judicial acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 30)\n\nIn its 2013 Answet to Petitionet\u2019s otiginal Petition, the State correctly asserted that Claim\nOne was procedutally defaulted because the double jeopardy argument presented in the original\nPetition was different from the double jeopardy argument Petitioner asserted on direct appeal. (D.I.\n\n10\n12 at 5 n.2) In its Answer filed in 2019, the State incorporates the 2013 Answer for its responses to\nClaims One through Eleven. Since 2013, however, Petitioner has filed a variety of motions in the\nDelawate Superior Court, and he presented the instant double jeopardy argument in a Rule 35\nmotion to vacate sentence that was filed sometime in 2013 or 2014. (See D.I. 78-1 at 29-33) The\nSuperior Coutt denied the double jeopardy argument as meritless, and the Delaware Supreme Court\naffirmed that decision. See State v. Weber, 2014 WL 4167492, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. July 29, 2014);\nWeber v. State, 113 A.3 1081 (Table), 2015 WL 2329160, at *2 (Del. May 12, 2015). Given these\ndevelopments, the State\u2019s reliance on its earlier assertion of procedural default with respect to Claim\nOne is unavailing.\n\nSince the Delaware Supreme Court eventually adjudicated Claim One on the merits, when it\naffirmed the Supetior Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s Rule 35 motion, Claim One will only warrant\ntelief if the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s decision was either contraty to, or an unteasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law.\n\n\u201cThe Double Jeopatdy Clause bars retrial following a coutt-decteed acquittal, even if the\nacquittal is \u2018based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u201d Evans v. Michigan, 568 U.S. 313, 318\n(2013). The Supreme Court has \u201cdefined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution\u2019s\nproof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.\u201d Id. As a result, an \u201cacquittal\u201d\nincludes \u201ca ruling by the coutt that the evidence is insufficient to convict,\u201d a \u201cfactual finding [that]\nnecessarily establish[es] the criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability,\u201d and any other \u201crulin[g]\nwhich telate[s] to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.\u201d Id. at 319. In contrast, \u201c[p]rocedural\ndismissals include rulings on questions that ate unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, but which\nserve other purposes, including a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may\nnot be punished because of some problem like an error with the indictment.\u201d Id. Although federal\n\n11\nlaw determines whether a prosecution violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Supreme Court has\nlooked to state law to determine whether a state coutt\u2019s decision constituted an acquittal. Id. at 320.\nNotably, Delaware law requires the Supetior Coutt to instruct juries on a lesser-included\ncharge that has a \u201ctational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense\ncharged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.\u201d 11 Del. Code \u00a7 206(c). In turn, the\ndouble jeopardy analysis has been codified in 11 Del. Code \u00a7 207, which states, in part:\nThere is an acquittal if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not\nguilty by the trier of fact or in a determination by the court that there\nwas insufficient evidence to watrant a conviction. A finding of guilty\nof a lesser included offense is an acquittal of the greater inclusive\noffense, although the conviction is subsequently set aside.\n\n11 Del. Code \u00a7 207(1).\n\nTurning to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that, while the\nDelaware Supreme Coutt did not cite to any U.S. Supreme Court precedent when affirming the\nSuperior Coutt\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s Rule 35 motion, the Delaware Supreme Coutt performed an\ninquiry consistent with the standard articulated in the aforementioned applicable federal law. See\nFaby v. Horn, 516 F.3d 169, 196 (3d Cir. 2008) (finding Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s decision\nwas not \u201ccontraty to\u201d clearly established Federal law because it appropriately relied on its own state\ncoutt cases, which articulated proper standard derived from Supreme Coutt precedent); Wilkams,\n529 US. at 406 (\u201c[A] run-of-the-mill state-court decision applying the correct legal rule from [U.S.\nSupreme Court] cases to the facts of a prisonet\u2019s case [does] not fit comfortably within\n\u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause.\u201d). Thus, the Delaware Supreme Courtt\u2019s decision was not contrary\nto clearly established federal law.\n\nThe Court must also determine if the Delaware Supreme Court reasonably applied U.S.\nSupreme Coutt precedent to the facts of Petitioner\u2019s case when denying the argument in Claim One.\n\n12\nThe issue is whether the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Petitioner\u2019s direct appeal that the trial\ncoutt etred by not including a lesser included offense instruction when it instructed the jury on\nattempted first degree robbery constituted an acquittal of the attempted first degree robbery\nconviction for double jeopatdy purposes. In its decision in Petitionet\u2019s Rule 35 appeal, the\nDelaware Supreme Coutt correctly noted that the Double Jeopardy clause bars retrial if the appellate\ncoutt overturns a juty\u2019s guilty verdict on insufficiency of evidence grounds, articulated what\nconstitutes an acquittal under 11 Del. Code \u00a7 207(1), and then opined that:\n\nThis Court\u2019s finding in Weber I that there was \u201csufficient evidence to\nsupport an acquittal of the First Degree Robbety Charge\u201d is not\nsynonymous to a finding of insufficient evidence to support\n[Petitionet\u2019s] conviction. . .. [OJur decision cannot be reasonably\nconstrued as a finding that the evidence was insufficient to support\n[Petitioner\u2019s] conviction because our inquiry was limited to whether\nthe instruction was available as a matter of law, and if so, whether the\nevidence at trial supported a conviction on the lesser-included-offense.\n\nThe coutt below cottectly noted that our decision in Weber I \u201cdoes not\nmean that [Petitioner] shov/d have been acquitted but merely that a\nreasonable jury cow/d have acquitted [Petitioner] on the robbery charge\nand they should have been allowed to consider the lesser included\noffense of Offensive Touching.\u201d In Weber I, we expressly stated that\nif the jury did not find the victim\u2019s \u201ctestimony entirely credible, they\ncould have concluded that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that [Petitioner] attempted first degree robbery.\u201d Because the\ntrial court\u2019s determination is the only reasonable construction of our\ndecision in Weber I, we find no merit to [Petitionet\u2019s] first claim.\n\nWeber, 2015 WL 2329160, at *2.\n\nThe Coutt concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Petitioner\u2019s first direct\nappeal (Weber I) \u2014 that there was \u201csufficient evidence to support an acquittal of the First Degree\nRobbery Chatge\u201d and also sufficient evidence to convict on the offense of offensive touching \u2014 did\nnot constitute an acquittal with respect to Petitioner\u2019s first degree robbery conviction. Notably,\nneither the Supetior Court\u2019s initial reason for not providing the lesser included offense, nor the\n\n13\nWeber I Coutt\u2019s teason for concluding that the lesser included offense should have been given,\nconstituted a ruling that the evidence was insufficient to convict Petitioner of first degree tobbery.\nFor instance, when denying Petitionet\u2019s request for a lesser included offense instruction on offensive\ntouching, the Superior Court explained that it believed offensive touching did not constitute a lesser\nincluded offense of first degree robbery under Delaware law \u201cand that, in any event, there was no\nrational basis to convict [Petitioner] on [o]ffensive [tJouching.\u201d Weber I, 971 A.2d at 141. The\nSuperior Court\u2019s refusal to give the lesser included offense instruction was not based on an analysis\nof the sufficiency of the evidence for first degree robbery. Relatedly, the Weber I Court\u2019s\ndetermination that the trial court should have given a lesser included offense was not due to the\nDelaware Supreme Court\u2019s determination that there was insufficient evidence to convict Petitioner\nof first degree robbery. Rather, the Weber I Coutt\u2019s conclusion was based on its determination that\n(a) Delaware law provided that offensive touching was a lesser included offense of first degree\ntobbery and (b) there was sufficient evidence to suppott a conviction of the lesser included offense.\nThe primary basis for the Weber I Court\u2019s conclusion was that, \u201c[i]f the jury did not find the\n[victim\u2019s] testimony entirely credible, they could have concluded that the State failed [to prove]\nbeyond a teasonable doubt that [Petitioner] attempted first degree robbery.\u201d Weber I, 971 A.2d at\n142.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Coutt finds that the Weber I Coutt\u2019s ruling did not\nadjudicate the ultimate question of Petitioner\u2019s factual guilt or innocence of first degree robbery and,\ntherefore, did not implicate the protections of the Double Jeopardy clause. Thus, Claim One does\n\nnot wattant habeas relief under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n14\nB. Claim Two: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by\ncalling the interaction between Petitioner and his victim a \u201cstruggle.\u201d Petitioner also argues that the\nptosecutot engaged in misconduct during rebuttal argument by expressing his opinion, vouching for\nOfficer Hawk\u2019s identification of Petitioner, improperly shifting the burden of proof, and\ncommenting on Petitioner\u2019s decision not to testify. Petitioner presented Claim Two to the Delaware\nSupreme Court on direct appeal, which summarily denied the Claim as meritless, without\nexplanation. See Weber, 38 A.3d at 278. Nevertheless, the Delaware Supreme Court's decision\nconstitutes an adjudication on the merits, and Petitioner will only be entitled to relief if the Delaware\nSupteme Court\u2019s decision was either contraty to, ot an unteasonable application of, clearly\nestablished federal law.\n\nIn order for a prosecutorial misconduct claim to warrant federal habeas telief, the\nptosecutor\u2019s actions must have \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting\nconviction a denial of due process.\u201d Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643 (1974); see also Darden\nv. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 180 (1986). A prosecutorial misconduct claim must be examined in\n\u201clight of the record as a whole\u201d in order to determine whether the conduct \u201chad a substantial and\ninjutious effect or influence\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict. Brecht \u00bb. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 638 (1993). In\nthe Third Circuit, this inquiry involves examining \u201cthe prosecutot\u2019s offensive actions in context and\nin light of the entire trial, assessing the severity of the conduct, the effect of the curative instructions,\nand the quantum of evidence against the defendant.\u201d Moore \u00bb. Morton, 255 F.3d 95 (3d Cit. 2001).\nSimply alleging prosecutorial misconduct fails to establish a violation of due process, because the\nfocus of the Darden inquiry is the unfairness of the trial, not the conduct of the prosecutor. See Smith\nv. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219 (1982).\n\n15\nPetitioner contends that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during closing\nargument in three ways. First, Petitioner asserts that the two ptosecutors* improperly called the\ninteraction between Petitioner and Naspo a struggle. That description, however, was appropriate\ngiven the evidence at trial. For instance, Naspo testified that he was at a gas station on August 18,\n2004 preparing to refill his car when a man, later identified as Petitioner, approached him, stated he\nwas going to take Naspo\u2019s car, told Naspo he had a gun, and then grabbed Naspo\u2019s left hand (in\nwhich Naspo held his car keys) with both hands. (D.I. 78-3 at 26-27) When asked if there was a\nstruggle, Naspo responded \u201csort of.\u201d (Id) The surveillance video memotializing the interaction \u2014\nwhich Petitioner characterizes as \u201cconfirm[ing] being any doubt there was no struggle\u201d \u2014 was played\nfor the juty and the jurors wete free to teach their own conclusion. (D.I. 1 at 48)\n\nGiven this record, the prosecutors\u2019 reference to the interaction as a \u201cstruggle\u201d was an\natguable but reasonable interpretation of the evidence, including the video that was admitted and\nplayed for the jury. Both sides were free to, and did, argue their interpretations during closing\nargument. Further, the Superior Court cuted any harm caused by the prosecutors\u2019 characterization\nof the evidence by instructing the jury to rely on the evidence presented during the trial rather than\nthe arguments of counsel. (D.I. 14, App. to Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. in Weber v. State, No. 23, 2011, at\nA107, A110)\n\nThe Third Circuit has consistently held that a \u201cprosecutor is entitled to considerable latitude\nin summation to atgue the evidence and any reasonable inferences that can be drawn from that\nevidence.\u201d United States v. Lee, 612 F.3d 170, 194 (3d Cir.2010). The prosecutors in this case did not\n\nmisstate ot manipulate the evidence; rather, their use of the term \u201cstruggle\u201d was a petmissible\n\nOne ptosecutot, Ms. Kate Keller, gave the closing argument and the other prosecutor, Mr. Stephen\nWalther, gave the rebuttal. (D.I. 14, App. to Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. in Weber \u00bb. State, No. 23, 2011, at\nA94-A97, A102-A107)\n\n16\nreference based upon the evidence introduced at trial. Therefore, the prosecutot\u2019s use of the term\n\u201cstruggle\u201d did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nNext, Petitioner contends that the prosecutot\u2019s use in rebuttal of the pronoun \u201cI\u201d when\ngiving a hypothetical example to explain offensive touching as a lesser included offense comprised\nimproper opinion and advocated the prosecutor\u2019s personal beliefs. Petitioner also asserts that the\nptosecutor\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know where defense counsel has been all this time,\u201d in\nrebutting defense counsel\u2019s statement that there was no evidence of an intent to commit robbery,\nimptopetly disparaged counsel. When viewed in the context of the whole record, neither of these\ncomments \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due\nptocess.\u201d Darden, 477 U.S. at 180.\n\nThird, Petitioner asserts that the prosecutor inappropriately vouched for Officer Hawk by\nstating, \u201cThere is no indication whatsoever that Officer Hawk had any ax to grind against\u201d\nPetitioner. (D.I. 1 at 58) The prosecutor made this statement when he compared the potential bias\nof Officer Hawk, who identified Petitioner, to that of Petitionet\u2019s child\u2019s mother, who testified that\nthe man in the crime scene video was not Petitioner. (D.I. 14, App. to Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. in Weber\nv. State, No. 23, 2011, at A107)\n\nA prosecutor cannot bolster his case by vouching for the credibility of a witness. See United\nStates v. Dispox-O-Plastics, Inc. 172 F.3d 275, 283 (3d 1999). A prosecutor\u2019s statements constitute\nvouching when two criteria are met:\n\n(1) the prosecutor must assute the juty that the testimony of a\nGovernment witness is credible; and (2) this assurance is based on\neither the prosecutot\u2019s personal knowledge, or other information not\ncontained in the record. Thus, it is not enough for a defendant on\nappeal to assert that the prosecutor assured the jury that a witness\u2019\ntestimony was credible. The defendant must be able to identify as the\n\nbasis for [the prosecutor\u2019s comment on witness credibility] explicit ot\n\n17\nimplicit reference to either the personal knowledge of the prosecuting\nattorney or information not contained in the record.\n\nUnited States v. Walker, 155 F.3d 180, 187 (1998). Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s contention, the\nprosecutot\u2019s act of pointing out differentials in sources of bias, drawn from information in the trial\nrecord, did not amount to improper vouching.\n\nPetitioner himself taised the issue of Officer Hawk\u2019s alleged bias and compared Hawk\u2019s\ntestimony with the testimony of the mother of Petitioner\u2019s child, stating:\n\nWhen Michelle Workman testified I can\u2019t identify this person, it is not\na good quality, I can\u2019t see this picture, it\u2019s true, you can\u2019t. And the\npolice officer who said he recognized [Petitioner] is the same police\nofficer who believes that T-shirt in that arrest thing is blue and not\ngtay. You can\u2019t rely on his testimony. He is bias[ed]. He is a police\nofficer. That\u2019s basically he didn\u2019t want to be bothered taking\nstatements or doing his work or doing his investigation. It was easier\nto say it\u2019s [Petitioner], looks like him, good enough for me.\n\n(DL. 14, App. to Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. in Weber v. State, No. 23, 2011, at A101-102) The\nptosecutor responded:\n\nThe defense telies upon Michelle Workman to convince you based\nupon her testimony and her looking at the crime scene video that that\nis not [Petitioner]. Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, to compare the bias\nof the woman to Officer Hawk simply is not supported by the evidence\nin this case. Thete is no indication whatsoever that Officer Hawk had\nany ax to grind against [Petitioner]. The only evidence is that he knew\nhim and that he had known him for years and he had seen him several\ntimes before August 18\" 2004 just doing his job.\n\nMichelle Workman, [Petitioner] is the father of her child. The bias is\ninherent. Of course she is going to come in hete to help him.\n\n(Id. at 104) The prosecutor\u2019s statement that Officer Hawk did not \u201chave an ax to grind\u201d was a\npetmissible reference based upon the evidence produced at trial in an effort to counter defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s rematks denigrating Hawk.\n\n18\nEven if the prosecutot\u2019s \u201cax to grind\u201d statement constituted vouching, it does not wartant\ngtanting Petitioner habeas relief. \u201cVouching aimed at the witness\u2019s credibility and... based on\nextta-record evidence is deemed non-constitutional error.\u201d United States v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 329\n(3d Cir. 2007). In turn, \u201cnon-constitutional etror is harmless where it is highly probable that the\nettot did not contribute to the judgment and the court has a sute conviction that the error did not\nptejudice the defendant.\u201d Id. A court determines prejudice by examining the \u201cscope of the\ncomments and their relationship to the proceeding, the extent of any curative instructions, and the\nstrength of the evidence against the defendant.\u201d Id. Here, the prosecutor only made the no \u201cax to\ngrind\u201d statement once, just before describing the evidence supporting Hawk\u2019s knowledge of\nPetitioner, and he did not express it in the form of a petsonal opinion. The trial court instructed the\njurors that their decisions must be based on the evidence seen and heard in the courtroom, and that\nthe statements and arguments made by the attorneys did not constitute evidence to be weighed in\nteaching a decision. Thus, even if the prosecutot\u2019s statement constituted vouching, the error was\nharmless and did not contribute to Petitionet\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, Petitioner was not\nprejudiced by the prosecutot\u2019s remark.\n\nFinally, Petitioner contends that, during his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor improperly\nshifted the burden of ptoof and improperly commented on Petitioner\u2019s failure to testify. To\nunderstand this contention, it is first necessary to excerpt the following portion of defense counsel\u2019s\nclosing argument:\n\nDid you heat any evidence from anybody what [Petitioner] was \u2014\nwhether he was wearing jewelry on that night? Did anybody say that?\n\nIf he was and he had an earring, does this individual in this picture have\nan eatring?\n\n19\nAnd if you looked at this pictute of the individual, on the back of his\nneck there is a chain. Is this a tattoo? Does [Petitioner] have any\ntattoos? Did they tell you? No.\n\nIf this individual has a tattoo and [Petitioner] doesn\u2019t, is this him? No.\nIf this individual doesn\u2019t have a goat-tee [sic] and [Petitioner] does, is\nthat him? No. And this person says this petson has a goat-tee. You\ncan look at it. At times there is some shading, at times there\u2019s not.\nYou can\u2019t tell. The quality of this picture is not of that value, but yet\nthey want you to convict someone of attempted robbery first degree,\na felony, based on that.\n\nOn this picture state exhibit seven, look at his hand. There appeats to\nbe something on his wrist. Whether that is a mark, whether that\u2019s a\nscat, whether that\u2019s a watch, we don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know.\nWouldn\u2019t you think you would want evidence if you saw somebody 45\nminutes later that he had the same things on his hands and if he doesn\u2019t\nis it him? No. Do you know? No. Do you have any pictures of his\nbody? No. Do you have any testimony from somebody? There is all\nthese cops thete, county cops, K-9 cops. Does anybody else come in\nto say oh, yeah, this is what I saw? No.\n\n(D.L. 14, App. to Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. in Weber v. State, No. 23, 2011, at A98-99) In rebuttal to\nPetitioner\u2019s argument, the prosecutor stated the following:\n\nDefense counsel suggests that in what he has referred to as a grainy,\nhard to see ctime scene video that there\u2019s an earting. You look at it.\nOkay. If you see there is an earring, fine, there is an earring. But what\nhe\u2019s suggesting is that the State should have seen [if] there was an\nearring in there and they should have offeted some evidence at some\npoint, perhaps on August 19th when he was attested, that he had an\nearring.\n\nThey also [raise] a straw argument well about tattoos, marks on his\natms, those kinds of things. Well, again, you look at the crime scene\nphoto. Is thete any indication that he has any scars? Is there any\nindication that he has any tattoos? No. If in fact he had some major\ngiant tattoo on his atm and you could clearly see his arms, don\u2019t you\nthink the defense would say look, this man in the crime scene video\nhas no tattoos, look at my client he\u2019s got a big tattoo that should be up\nthere? That wasn\u2019t the evidence. He thtows it back on the State to\nprove something that is not even an element of the offense.\n\n(Id. at A105)\n\n20\nThe prosecutot\u2019s remarks wete fair rebuttal to defense counsel\u2019s comments and were\nbased on the trial record as a whole. They did not \u201cso infect[] the trial with unfairness as to\nmake the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d Darden, 477 U.S. at 180.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s tejection\nof all the arguments in Claim Two was neither contrary to, nor an unteasonable application of,\nDarden.\n\nC. Claim Three: Judicial Enctoachment Duting Voir Dire\n\nIn Claim Three, Petitioner contends that the Superior Court\u2019s improper, prejudicial, and\ninsufficient voir dire interfered with the presentation of his defense. (D.I. 1 at 63) Petitioner asserts\nthat the State \u201cincorrectly represented to the trial court that . . . Petitioner intended to present an\ninsanity defense,\u201d and \u201crequested two highly prejudicial soir dire questions concerning drug use and\nmental illness.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 24) He further alleges that, despite his immediate objection that he did\nnot intend to present any insanity defense, the Superior Court improperly asked the prospective jury\npanel the two questions pertaining to mental illness and illicit drug use. (D.I. 1 at 64) He states that,\nas a result, the\n\nvoir dire was ptejudicial and inflammatory and suggested Petitioner was\nmentally ill and a drug user. The improper voir dire created such\nuntealized expectations and exposed the jury to the highly prejudicial\nand inflammatoty stigma of mental illness and drug use as to infect the\nentite proceeding with unfairness and a denial of due process.\nExacetbating this error yet further, the trial court improperly\npetsuaded Petitioner to abandon his intended defense, which would\nhave negated the prejudicial effect of the voir dire.\n(D.I. 1 at 64) According to Petitioner, he never indicated to the State that: (1) \u201che might present\n\nevidence he was not criminally responsible due to mental defect;\u201d (2) \u201che might suffer from mental\n\ndefect;\u201d (3) \u201che might have a long history of drug abuse;\u201d ot (4) \u201che intended to pursue a guilty but\n\n21\nmentally ill defense ot any other defense based on mental illness.\u201d (D.I. 105 at 17-18) He also\nassetts that he \u201cnever proffered an expert opinion that he was suffering mental illness.\u201d (D.I. 105 at\n18) Instead, Petitioner intended to present a \u201cnuanced defense on the elements\u201d that his behavior\non the night of the offense was due to adverse effects from prescription medication. (D.I. 1 at 64-\n65) According to Petitionet, this \u201cdefense of renunciation . . . negated any culpability even if it was\ndetermined thete was sufficient evidence to support mens rea and actus reus.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 65)\n\nIn Weber II, the Delaware Supteme Court summarily denied the arguments in Claim Three as\nmeritless. Therefore, Claim Three will only warrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nwas either contraty to, ot an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n\nPursuant to well-settled U.S. Supreme Court precedent, a trial court is granted wide\ndiscretion in determining the scope and manner of svir dire, including which questions will be asked\nand whether individual questioning will be permitted. See Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 427\n(1991); Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 528 (1973); Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308, 310\n(1931). Nevertheless, \u201cthe exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion, and the restriction upon inquiries\nat the request of counsel, ate subject to the essential demands of fairness.\u201d Morgan \u00bb. Illinois, 504 U.S.\n719, 730 (1992). In Connors v. United States, 158 U.S. 408, 413 (1895), the Supreme Coutt stated:\n\n[A] suitable inquiry is permissible in order to ascertain whether the\njuror has any bias, opinion, or prejudice that would affect or control\nthe fair determination by him of the issues to be tried. That inquiry is\nconducted under the supervision of the court, and a great deal must,\nof necessity, be left to its sound disctetion. This is the rule in civil\ncases, and the same tule must be applied in criminal cases.\nThe manner in which the Superior Court conducted voir dire in Petitionet\u2019s case did not\n\nrender his trial unfair. Contraty to his assertion, the record demonstrates that Petitioner did indicate\n\nto both the State and the Superior Court that he was contemplating the possibility of presenting\n\n22\nsotne type of defense related to his mental condition. For instance, the Superior Court docket\ncontains an entry dated January 13, 2010, approximately four months before trial was scheduled to\nbegin, stating:\n\nThe Coutt has received copies of the reports of Dr. Donahue and Mr.\n\nRichmond provided by Mr. Ramunno which wete also forwarded to\n\nthe State on January 8, 2010. Obviously the Coutt needs to give the\n\nState some time to digest the reports and, if necessary, obtain a rebuttal\n\nexpett. As such, the deadline for the State\u2019s reports, if any, to be\n\nptovided to Mr. Ramunno, will be February 26, 2010.\n(D.I. 14, Super. Ct. Crim. Dkt. as of 9/30/2013, at Entry No. 129) At the beginning of voir dire, the\nState informed the Superior Court that it had \u201csome proposed juty instructions, voir dire\ninstructions,\u201d \u201cgiven the fact that [the State] ha[d] received from defense counsel notice that there\nwould be an insanity defense.\u201d (D.I. 2 at 3) The Superior Court asked defense counsel if he had any\nobjection, and defense counsel replied \u201cyes.\u201d (Id.) Defense counsel then explained,\n\nbecause I think there may or may not be testimony. Because at this\n\npoint in time it\u2019s their case. Thete is notice. But we haven\u2019t presented\n\nany expert testimony and may not present any expert testimony.\n\n[Petitioner\u2019s] position is that he does not intend on raising an insanity\n\ndefense, if you will, basically because of the circumstances of the case\n\nand the medication he was on. It is his position that his defense would\n\nbe an involuntaty in[toxication] \u2014 it goes to the state of mind as far as\n\nthe intentional act, but he does not intend to present a mental illness\n\nas we know the traditional one.\n(Id) \u2018The State responded that the expert opinion proffered by defense counsel suggested that\nPetitioner was suffering from a mental illness which substantially affected his ability to understand\nthe wrongfulness of his acts and that Petitioner was guilty but mentally ill. (D.I. 2 at 4) The expert\n\nopinion also recounted Petitionet\u2019s long history of alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine abuse.\n\n(4)\n\n23\nIn light of the expert\u2019s opinion proffered by defense counsel, the State asked the Superior\nCoutt to inquite of the venire whether they had any predispositions about either mental illness or\nillegal drug use. The Superior Court decided to ask the questions requested by the State, ruling that:\n\nI think both questions ate appropriate to ensure not only from the\n\nState\u2019s point but I think from the defense point of view. If the\n\ncircumstances were that the trial proceeds perhaps not in the way the\n\ndefendant believes it may flow but if [defense counsel] feels to\n\nappropriately defend the action he has introduced a defense about\n\nmental illness or drug use that would affect his mental state, there are\n\nquestions that need to be asked to a jury to ensure we don\u2019t have\n\nsomeone who may have an adverse reaction to them which would be\n\nadverse to [Petitioner] not just to the State, so I think both questions\n\nate appropriate and will be asked of the jury panel.\n(D.1. 2 at 4) Consequently, the Superior Court asked two questions: \u201chas any member of the panel,\na close friend or relative, ever been diagnosed with a mental disorder or psychiatric disorder?\u201d and\n\u201cthere may be, and I emphasize may be, testimony in the trial regarding the unlawful use of\ndrugs. If such evidence was presented, would it affect your ability to tender a fair and impartial\nverdict based solely on the evidence ptesented?\u201d (D.L. 2 at 6)\n\nAs an initial matter, the Court concludes that the trial court\u2019s determination that it should\nptesent the State\u2019s proposed questions to the potential jurors was reasonable because: (1) defense\ncounsel proffered the expert opinion raising the issue of Petitionet\u2019s mental illness due to prior drug\nuse; and (2) defense counsel indicated he was considering presenting a non-traditional mental illness\ndefense of intoxication. The two questions proposed by the State were relevant to determining if\nany potential juror harbored any bias against the mentally ill ot users of illegal drugs. In turn, the\n\nquestions were designed to eliminate bias against Petitionet\u2019s potential defense and were also crafted\n\nso as not to indicate that each was directed at Petitioner. Thus, the Court concludes that the two\n\n24\nquestions concerning mental illness and prior drug use that the trial court asked during voir dire did\nnot violate Petitioner\u2019s right to an impartial jury and fair trial.\n\nAt the close of the State\u2019s case, and upon the Superior Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion\nfor dismissal based on insufficient evidence, the Superior Court engaged Petitioner and defense\ncounsel regarding whether Petitioner would call witnesses to pursue a theory that Petitioner was not\nthe person who committed the crimes, or whether Petitioner would call witnesses (including an\nexpert and Petitioner himself) to pursue a theory that while Petitioner committed the crimes, he was\nnot responsible for those crimes due to his mental condition. (D.I. 2-1 at 19-21) Petitioner\ncomplains that the Superiot Coutt\u2019s discussion improperly intruded into his defense strategy and\ninftinged on his right to consult with counsel, but at the same time was \u201cwoefully insufficient\u201d\ntegarding Petitioner\u2019s decision as to whether or not to testify.\n\nThe record suggests that Petitioner\u2019s own case management necessitated the Superior\nCoutt\u2019s inquiry. As previously discussed, before trial commenced, Petitioner indicated he had not\nyet decided whether to present his mental condition defense. (D.I. 2 at 3-4) At that time, both\npatties indicated that, should Petitioner elect to call the expert, it may create scheduling difficulties.\n(Id) It was therefore necessary and approptiate for the trial court to evaluate, before the beginning\nof the defense case, which witnesses the defense would ultimately call. The trial court\u2019s comments\ntegarding the logical inconsistencies between the two theories did not, as Petitioner claims, dissuade\nhim from pursuing the mental state defense; the trial court only pointed out the difficulties in\npursuing both defenses at the same time. (D.I. 2-1 at 19) Defense counsel said he recommended\nthat Petitioner not pursue the mental state defense, while the prosecutor pointed out the risk of\nexposing Petitioner\u2019s criminal record if he chose to testify. (Id. at 19-20) The trial court twice\nexcused Petitioner and defense counsel so that they could confer, and repeatedly encouraged\n\n25\nPetitioner to make the choice with defense counsel; Petitioner ultimately made the choice to pursue\nthe first theory of identification. (Id) This record belies Petitionet\u2019s contention that the trial court\ninterfered with his choice as to which defense theory to pursue. Therefore, the Court will deny this\nportion of Claim Three as factually baseless.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s second argument, that the colloquy as to whether he would take the stand was\ninsufficient to advise him of his tight to testify or not, is similarly unavailing. A court \u201chas no duty\nto explain to the defendant that he or she has a right to testify or to verify that the defendant who is\nnot testifying has waived that right voluntarily.\u201d United States v. Pennycooke, 65 F.3d 9, 11 3d Cit.\n1995). As noted, the discussion as to which theory Petitioner would pursue included a discussion of\nthe risks of taking the stand. (D.I. 2-1 at 20) After Petitioner decided to pursue the identification\ndefense, the trial court confirmed that Petitioner had had an oppottunity to talk with defense\ncounsel befote making the \u201cindividual decision\u201d not to testify. (Id. at 21) Petitioner stated that he\nhad discussed the decision with defense counsel and that he had decided not to testify. (Id) The\ntrial court did not have a duty to do anything further to protect Petitionet\u2019s constitutional rights. See\nUnited States v. Gordon, 290 F.3d 539, 546 (3d Cir. 2002). Thus, the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s\ndecision denying Petitioner relief on this issue was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law.\n\nD. Claim Four: Privation of Jury Lenity\n\nNext, Petitioner contends that he was denied the tight to \u201cjury lenity\u201d because the jury on\nretrial \u2014 which considered the attempted first degree robbery charge \u2014 did not know he had already\nbeen convicted of carjacking. He argues that Delaware recently enacted legislation \u201cto abolish the\noffense of carjacking in toto and merge the offense with robbery,\u201d revealing \u201cit was never the intent\nto impose dual punishments for the two offenses.\u201d (D.I. 105 at 24)\n\n26\nPetitioner presented this argument to the Delawate Supreme Coutt in support of his double\njeopardy argument. The Court discusses the double jeopardy implications of Claim Four in its\nanalysis of Claim Eight. See infra at Section IV.G. To the extent Claim Fout asserts an independent\natgument, it does not warrant relief.\n\nPetitioner cites the following portion of United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 64-66 (1984), as\nsupport for his argument:\n\nA verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury\n\ndid not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show they wete\nnot convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\n\n* * *\n\n[Juty lenity] is recognition of the juty\u2019s historic function, in criminal\ntrials, as a check against arbitrary or oppressive exercises of power by\nthe executive branch.\nPowell explains that jury lenity is one of several potential explanations for an inconsistent verdict that\nundetlies the rule against a defendant attacking a conviction because it is inconsistent with an\nacquittal. Sve id. at 61-67. Yet, there is no independent constitutional right to \u201cjury lenity,\u201d and a\nclaim alleging inconsistent verdicts does not provide a basis for habeas relief. See zd. at 63. Thus, the\nfact that the jurors evaluating Petitionet\u2019s attempted robbery charge were unaware of his conviction\nfor carjacking does not aid in Petitioner\u2019s request for habeas relief.\nE. Claim Five: Insufficient Evidence\nIn Claim Five, Petitioner asserts there was insufficient evidence to allow the juty to convict\nhim of attempted first degree robbery. (D.I. 1 at 88) The Delaware Supreme Court summarily\ndenied Claim Five as meritless in Weber II. Thus, the Court must teview Claim Five under \u00a7 2254(d)\n\nto determine if Petitioner is entitled to habeas relief.\n\n27\nThe United States Supreme Court precedent governing insufficient evidence claims is Jackson\n\u00bb. Virginia, 443 US. 307 (1979). Pursuant to Jackson, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any tational triet of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the ctime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 319. This standard\n\u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as\ndefined by state law.\u201d Id. at 324 n.16. Additionally, \u201ca federal habeas court faced with a tecord of\nhistorical facts that suppotts conflicting inferences must presume \u2014 even if it does not affirmatively\nappear in the record \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution,\nand must defer to that resolution.\u201d Id. at 326. It is not necessaty that the evidence exclude every\nreasonable hypothesis except that of guilt. See id.\n\nHere, Petitioner generally contends that the State failed to prove the elements of attempt,\nsubstantial step, specific intent, threat of force, and permanent deprivation. (D.I. 1 at 88) His\nargument is unavailing.\n\nIn order for Petitioner to be convicted of attempted first degree robbery, the State had to\nptove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) Petitioner\u2019s conduct occutted in the\ncoutse of attempting to commit a theft; (2) Petitioner must have threatened the immediate use of\nfotce on Mr. Naspo; (3) Petitioner must have acted with the intent to compel the owner of the\nproperty ot another person to deliver up the property; (4) Petitioner either represented by word or\nconduct that he was in possession of a deadly weapon, in this case a gun, and/or the victim was 62\nyeats of age ot older; and (5) Petitioner\u2019s conduct was intentional, voluntary and \u2014 under the\ncircumstances as he believed them to be \u2014 was a substantial step in a coutse of conduct planned to\nculminate in his commission of the crime of first degree robbery. (D.I. 14, App. to Appellant\u2019s Op.\nBr. in Weber v. State, No. 23, 2011, at A108)\n\n28\nOn Webet\u2019s motion for acquittal, the Superior Court found Petitioner \u201csaid I want your cat\nand I have a gun and there is a skirmish that occurs, and so to the Court there appears to be no\nquestion that there is an attempted robbery that is occurring here.\u201d (D.I. 2-1 at 19) Naspo testified\nthat Petitioner said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take yout car,\u201d while grabbing Naspo\u2019s hands to try to get Naspo\u2019s\nkeys. (D.I. 2 at 21) The video surveillance showed a struggle between Naspo and Petitioner. See\nWeber I, 971 A.2d at 142. Viewing the video and Naspo\u2019s testimony in the light most favorable to\nthe State, the Court concludes that a rational trier of fact could have found Petitioner committed a\nsubstantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in overcoming Naspo\u2019s tesistance to\nPetitioner taking his car. See 11 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 531(2), 532, 832.\n\nAs for the threat and/or use of force element, the video showed a struggle that caused\nNaspo offense and alarm, and caused him to fall against the door of his cat. Naspo testified that\nPetitioner grabbed Naspo\u2019s hands with both of his hands trying to get his keys, and that Petitioner\ntwice told him he had a gun. (D.I. 2 at 21, 28) In Petitioner\u2019s first direct appeal, the Delaware\nSupreme Court found that the video evidence alone was sufficient to at least prove offensive\ntouching. See Weber I, 971 A.2d at 142. Then, when denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for reargument\nwith respect to Petitioner\u2019s second appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court concluded that Naspo\u2019s\ntestimony, combined with the video, was sufficient to support the juty\u2019s finding of actual or\nthreatened use of force. (D.I. 2-3 at 20-21)\n\nAfter viewing the evidence of the struggle over the keys and Petitioner\u2019s threat of a gun in\nthe light most favorable to the State, the Court concludes a rational trier of fact could have\nconcluded that Petitioner both used and threatened force in attempting to tob Naspo, and that\nPetitioner represented by word that he was in possession of a deadly weapon. See 11 Del. Code\n\u00a7\u00a7 831 (a), 832(a)(2).\n\n29\nAs for the elements of intent and permanent deprivation, Petitionet\u2019s statement \u201cI\u2019m going\nto take your cat\u201d shows Petitioner\u2019s intent to permanently deprive Naspo of his car. (D.I. 2 at 21)\nViewing Petitionet\u2019s statement and actions in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of\nfact could have found Petitioner intended to permanently deprive Naspo of his cat.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s denial of\nPetitioner\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction was not contrary to,\not an unteasonable application of, Jackson. Therefore, the Coutt will deny Claim Five.\n\nF. Claims Six and Seven: Insufficient Instruction on the Elements and Defenses\n\nIn Claim Six, Petitioner contends that the Superior Coutt provided an insufficient\ninstruction on the elements of the attempted first degree robbery offense because the instruction did\nnot include the statutory definitions of the elements. In Claim Seven, Petitioner asserts that the\nSuperior Coutt should have instructed the jury on the defense theories of renunciation and legal\nimpossibility. Petitioner presented these Claims to the Delaware Supreme Court on direct appeal\nafter his retrial (i.e, Weber II), and then again in his motion for reargument from the Delaware\nSupreme Coutt\u2019s decision in Weber II. When denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for reargument, the\nDelawate Supreme Coutt denied both Claims as waived under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 and\nalso as affirmatively waived. (See D.I. 14, Weber v. State, No.23,2011 Order, at 4-5 (Del. Mar. 20,\n2012)) Specifically, the Delaware Supreme Coutt held:\n\nAfter reading the above instructions, the trial judge asked counsel,\n\u201cAny objections to the instructions read?\u201d Counsel for [Petitioner]\nteplied, \u201cNo, Your Honot.\u201d\n\n[Petitioner] assigns error to juty instructions that were either not\nrequested, or to which he never objected, and thus his claims are\nconsidered waived under Supreme Court Rule 8. Moreover, in his\nbrief, [Petitioner] provided no explanation as to why the unpreserved\nettor is plain.\n\n30\nNot only did Petitioner fail to preserve ertor by not objecting to any\nof the jury instructions, [Petitioner] affirmatively waived his claims.\n\nIa.\n\nBy applying the procedural bar of Rule 8, the Delaware Supreme Court articulated a \u201cplain\nstatement\u201d under Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 263-64 (1989), that its decision rested on state law\ngtounds. This Court has consistently held that Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 is an independent\nand adequate state ptocedural rule precluding federal habeas review absent a showing of cause for\nthe default, and prejudice resulting therefrom, or a showing that a miscattiage of justice will occur if\nthe claim is not reviewed. See Campbell v. Burns, 515 F.3d 172, 182 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nPetitioner has not provided any cause for his default of Claims Six and Seven.\u2019 In the\nabsence of cause, the Coutt will not address the issue of prejudice. Additionally, the miscarriage of\njustice exception to the procedural default doctrine is inapplicable because Petitioner has not\nprovided any new teliable evidence of his actual innocence. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claims\nSix and Seven as ptocedurally barred.\n\nG. Claim Eight: Carjacking and Robbery Convictions Violate Double Jeopardy\n\nPetitioner atgues that his convictions for attempted first degree robbery and attempted first\ndegree carjacking merged for sentencing purposes, theteby rendering the imposition of cumulative\npunishments for both convictions a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Mote specifically,\nPetitioner argues:\n\n[Petitioner] actually served the sentence imposed for the carjacking\noffense and was teleased from prison. [Petitioner] later returned to\n\nptison to serve another sentence for identical conduct under a statute\nwith the identical elements [#.\u00a2., the robbery statute].\n\n>Petitioner\u2019s argument concerning the difference between forfeiture and waiver is not an argument\nto establish cause but, rather, an argument as to why the Delaware state courts erroneously view the\nClaims as waived.\n\n31\n(D.I. 105 at 81) The Delaware Supreme Court summarily denied this argument in Petitioner\u2019s direct\nappeal after his conviction on retrial. See Weber II, 38 A.3d at 278. Thus, Claim Hight will only\nwarrant relief if the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s decision was either contrary to, ot an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law.\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\nSee North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). In Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 164-65 (1977),\nthe Supreme Coutt explained that the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause also protect\nagainst a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. Id. The traditional test for\ndetermining if two offenses under separate statutes are sufficiently distinguishable to permit the\nimposition of cumulative punishments is the same-elements test set forth in Blockburger v. United\nStates, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). Pursuant to Blckburger, a court must analyze \u201cwhether each offense\ncontains an element not contained in the other; if not, they ate the \u2018same offense\u2019 and double\njeopardy bats additional punishment and successive prosecution.\u201d United States v. Dixon, 509 US.\n688, 696 (1993). The tule articulated in Bockburger, howevet, is a \u201ctule of statutory construction to\nhelp determine legislative intent;\u201d it is \u201cnot controlling when the legislative intent is clear from the\nface of the statute or the legislative history.\u201d Garrett v. United States, 471 U.S. 773, 778-79 (1985).\nConsequently, \u201ceven if the crimes are the same under Blockburger, if it is evident that a state\nlegislature intended to authorize cumulative punishments, a coutt\u2019s inquity is at an end.\u201d Ohio v.\nJohnson, 467 U.S. 493, 499 n.8 (1984). As the Supreme Court held in Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S.\n359, 368-69 (1983):\n\n[S]imply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe\n\nthe same conduct under the Blockburger test does not mean that the\n\n32\nDouble Jeopardy Clause precludes the imposition, in a single trial, of\ncumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes. .. .\n\nWhere . . . a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment\n\nunder two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe\n\nthe \u201csame\u201d conduct under Blockburger, a coutt\u2019s task of statutory\n\nconstruction is at an end, and the prosecutor may seek and the trial\n\ncoutt of juty may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes\n\nina single trial.\n\nAt the time of Petitioner\u2019s conviction, Delaware\u2019s carjacking statute explicitly stated that\n\n\u201cThis section is not a telated or included offense of \u00a7 831 [second degree robbery] or \u00a7 832 [first\ndegree robbery] of this title. Nothing in this statute shall be deemed to preclude prosecution under\nany other provision of this Code.\u201d 11 Del. Code \u00a7 835(f) (2003). In 2019, the Delaware General\nAssembly repealed the carjacking statute,* and Petitioner argues that the repeal was done in\n\u201crecognition that it was never the intent to impose punishments for both carjacking and tobbery.\u201d\u00ae\n(D.I. 105 at 81; D.I. 119 at 2; D.L 124; D.I. 125 at 10.3) Petitionet\u2019s argument is unpetsuasive.\nPresumably, if the legislature truly never intended to impose punishments for both offenses, the\nDelawate General Assembly would have expressly made the repeal retroactively applicable. Yet, as\nthe Delaware Superior Court explained in its most recent decision denying Petitioner\u2019s instant\natgument, the Delaware General Assembly did not expressly make the repeal of the carjacking\nstatute retroactively applicable, and well-established Delaware law precludes finding that that the\n\nrepeal of the carjacking statute is implicitly retroactive. See State v. Weber, 2022 WL 2112949, at *4\n\n(Del. Super. Ct. June 8, 2022); D.I. 125-1 at 9-11) \u2018Thus, given the General Assembly\u2019s clear intent at\n\n4See 82 Del. Laws, c. 216, \u00a7 1, eff. Sept. 16, 2019.\n\n5During the pendency of this ptoceeding, Petitioner filed a Motion to Bifurcate and/or Obtain a\nSummary Judgment on Claim Eight. (D.I. 119) The Court denied the Motion on March 31, 2022,\nbut informed Petitioner that it would consider the argument in Claim Eight presented in that\nMotion when it considered his Petition as a whole. (See D.I. 122) The instant discussion of Claim\nEight includes the argument presented in the Motion to Bifurcate/Obtain Summaty Judgment.\n\n33\nthe time of Petitionet\u2019s conviction to authorize cumulative punishments for first degree robbery and\ncatjacking, the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s denial of Claim Eight was neither contrary to, nor an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Accordingly, the Coutt will deny Claim\nEight for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nH. Claim Nine: Plea Bargain Process Violated Due Process\n\nIn Claim Nine, Petitioner contends that the State\u2019s withdrawal of the original plea offer\ndeprived him of due process and a fair trial, and constituted selective prosecution.\u2019 The Supetior\nCourt denied these arguments as meritless when it denied Petitionet\u2019s motion to enforce the plea\nagreement, and the Delaware Supreme Court summarily affirmed that decision. See State \u00bb. Weber,\n2010 WL 5343153, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 15, 2010); Weber II, 38 A.3d at 278. Given these\ncitcumstances, Claim Nine will only warrant relief if the Supetior Coutt\u2019s decision was either\ncontrary to, of an unteasonable application of, clearly established federal law. See Wilson v. Sellers,\n138 S. Ct. 1188, 1193-94 (2018) (reiterating that when higher coutt affirms lower court\u2019s judgment\nwithout opinion ot other explanation, federal habeas law employs \u201clook through\u201d presumption and\nassumes that later unexplained order upholding lower coutt\u2019s reasoned judgment tests upon same\ngtounds as lowet coutt judgment).\n\n\u201c[T]here is no federal constitutional right to plea bargain; the prosecutor need not do so if he\nptefers to go to trial.\u201d Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 561 (1977). The State may withdraw a plea\noffer at any time befote it is accepted or detrimentally relied upon. See Government of Virgin Islands v.\nScotland, 614 F.2d 360 (1980) (generally, until ot unless defendant actually accepts plea deal,\n\ngovernment can always withdraw its plea offer, and defendant cannot compel reinstatement of\n\n\u00b0To the extent Petitioner presents Claim Nine as a breach of contract claim, it constitutes a non-\ncognizable state law claim. Se, \u00a2.g., Fortenberry v. Sternes, 2003 WL 21939558, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 13,\n2003).\n\n34\nwithdrawn plea deal since he has no right to compel specific performance unless or until he has\nrelied on deal to his detriment).\n\nThe Superior Court explained its reasons for denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to enforce the plea\noffer as follows:\n\n[Petitioner] seeks to enforce the original plea offer made to him by the\nState. This plea agreement would have required [Petitioner] to plead\nguilty to Attempted Robbery Second and the State would recommend\na sentence of five years at level five. In response, [Petitioner] requested\nthe State to agree that he was entitled to credit time of approximately\ntwo yeats. The State refused to agtee, and the original offer was\ntejected. A few days later, in response to defendant\u2019s credit time\nrequest, the State modified its offer and agreed that [Petitioner] could\nteceive the credit time but in doing so would inctease its Level 5\nrecommendation to seven yeats. This would ensure [Petitioner] would\nsetve the five years the State was seeking. [Petitioner] rejected the\nmodified offer and the case ptoceeded to trial.\n\nThe Court will not enforce the original plea offer made by the State.\nFirst, as a general matter, a defendant has no legal entitlement to a plea\nbargain. Thus, the State has no obligation to provide him with one. A\nplea agreement is undertaken for mutual advantage and governed by\ncontract ptinciples. Acceptance of an offer is required for the\nformation of an enforceable contract. A defendant\u2019s rejection of the\nState\u2019s offer ordinarily terminates the defendant\u2019s right to accept the\noffer. A defendant has \u201cno right to requite the prosecutor to te-offer\na plea which was rejected by the defendant.\u201d\n\nNothing in this case suggests that [Petitioner] and the State ever\nreached an actual agreement with respect to the terms of [Petitioner\u2019s]\nplea. It appeats that the State originally offered a plea that included a\nrecommendation of five years, but [Petitionet] would only accept the\noffer if the State agreed that he was entitled to two years of credit time.\nThe State rejected this proposal but modified its offer with a seven year\nrecommendation with no objection to the credit time. [Petitioner]\nrejected this offer and the case proceeded to trial. [Petitioner] now\nclaims that he would have accepted the State\u2019s offer of five years at\nlevel five and that the State unfairly revised its offer to seven years\nbecause of the application of credit time. However, there is no\nevidence in the record to suggest that there was a \u201cmeeting of the\nminds\u201d sufficient to establish an enforceable contract. Accordingly,\n\n35\n[Petitioner] cannot show that he has a contractual right to the\nenforcement of the State\u2019s plea offer.\n\nWeber, 2010 WL 5343153, at *1.\n\nPetitioner contends the Superior Court erred in its factual findings surrounding the plea\nnegotiations, specifically, that Petitioner did not in fact respond to the prtosecutor\u2019s original plea\noffer by \u201crequest[ing]\u201d time served, and Petitioner did not in fact \u201creject\u201d this original offer when it\ndid not contain that allowance. Petitioner claims he assumed the original offer included time\nsetved, and he stated his intent to accept that offer, but then the prosecutor changed the plea\noffer. (D.I. 1-2 at 11-12) According to Petitioner\u2019s version of the facts, there was a \u201cmeeting of the\nminds\u201d and therefore an enforceable plea agreement, and he dettimentally relied on the plea offer by\nnot preparing for trial. (Id)\n\nPetitioner has not provided any evidence to support his version of the facts, much less the\ncleat and convincing evidence required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Consequently, the Court\nconcludes that the Superior Court reasonably determined the facts in light of the evidence presented\nwhen it determined that Petitioner and the prosecutors did not reach an agreement with respect to\nthe terms of Petitionet\u2019s plea.\n\nAs patt of his argument, Petitioner asserts that the State made a pretrial comment that he\nhad \u201cgotten away\u201d with a criminal offense in the past. To the extent Petitionet is attempting to\ndemonstrate that the State vindictively withdrew the plea offer, the attempt is unavailing. In\nBordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 362-63 (1978), the Supreme Coutt held that a prosecutot\u2019s threat\nmade during plea bargaining, based on the prosecutot\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s ptior felony\nconvictions, did not violate due process, and explained this was distinct from vindictive reindictment\n\not sentencing because, \u201c[i]n the \u2018give-and-take\u2019 of plea bargaining, there is no [constitutionally\n\n36\nimpermissible] element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or teject\nthe prosecution's offer.\u201d Here, the State\u2019s alleged pretrial comment did not impede Petitioner from\naccepting or rejecting the prosecution\u2019s offer and, therefore, did not violate Petitionet\u2019s\nconstitutional rights.\n\nBased on the fotegoing, the Court concludes that the Superior Coutt\u2019s refusal to grant\nPetitioner\u2019s motion to enforce the State\u2019s original plea offer was neither contrary to, nor an\nunteasonable application of, Weatherford or Bordenkircher. Therefore, the Court will deny Claim Nine.\n\nI. Claim Ten: Insufficient Evidence of Identification\n\nIn Claim Ten, Petitioner contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his\nidentification and that the circumstances of his out-of-coutt identification violated his due process\ntights. Petitioner also asserts that Officer Hawk\u2019s testimony wattanted voir dire on whether\nindividual prospective jurors would give mote weight to a police officet\u2019s testimony than they would\ngive to the testimony provided by other witnesses. (D.I. 1-2 at 42) The Delaware Supreme Court\nsummarily denied the first two arguments in Claim Ten as meritless in Weber II. Although the Court\ncannot discern if the Delawate Supreme Court addressed Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the trial\ncoutt\u2019s failure to question the potential jurors\u2019 ability to impartially evaluate a police officer\u2019s\ncredibility, the State treats the argument as though it was considered by the Delaware Superior Court\nin Weber II. (D.I. 12 at 27-28) In these circumstances, all three arguments in Claim Ten will only\nwattant habeas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was contrary to, ot constituted an\nunteasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n\n1. Insufficient evidence of identification\n\nAs previously discussed, the clearly established federal law governing insufficient evidence\n\nclaims is the standard articulated in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319. \u201c[T]he relevant question is\n\n37\nwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational triet\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a teasonable doubt.\u201d Id.\n\nThe State presented the same identification evidence in Petitionet\u2019s first trial and then again\nin his retrial. The Delaware Supreme Court twice found that evidence to be sufficient:\n\n[T]he State presented sufficient evidence that Weber was the person\nseen in the surveillance video accosting Naspo. Although Naspo did\nnot positively identify [Petitioner] as his assailant, Hawk independently\nidentified [Petitioner] as the person shown on the surveillance video.\nNaspo was seventy four years old at the time of the incident, which\noccurred at approximately 10 p.m. Naspo\u2019s contact with [Petitioner]\nlasted only a few seconds. Hawk, however, testified that he had known\n[Petitioner] since 1985. Moreover, the jury watched the surveillance\ntape at trial, thus enabling the jurors to make their own determination.\nIn addition to observing [Petitioner] during the trial, the jury also\nviewed pictures of [Petitioner] taken at the time of his arrest.\n\n* * *\n\nHawk identified [Petitioner] based on two factors: his review of the\nsutveillance video and his familiarity with [Petitioner\u2019s] appearance.\nNot only had Hawk known [Petitioner] since 1985 but also he saw\n[Petitioner] on the day of the incident. The jurors did not know how\n[Petitioner] looked on the day of the incident. They only knew how\n[Petitioner] looked at the time of his arrest (from pictures taken at the\npolice station,) and how he looked during the trial (through ditect\nobservation).\n\nThe juty also heard other evidence concerning identification. Naspo\notiginally described his assailant as []a white male, approximately 35\nyeats old, 5\u20196\u201d, 5\u20197\u201d in height, short brown hair, no facial hair,\napproximately 160 pounds. ... The person was wearing jean shorts\nand a blue t-shitt.... [Petitioner] matched that description. Although\nNaspo otiginally stated that his assailant had \u201cno facial hair,\u201d the\nsutveillance tape showed that the petson who attacked Naspo had a\ngoatee.... Hawk testified that when he saw [Petitioner] in the Sleepy\u2019s\nparking lot, [Petitioner] did have a goatee. [Hawk] testified that when\nhe [saw] [Petitioner] approximately 45 minutes after the attempted\ntobbety, [Petitioner] was wearing []blue jeans and a large blue t-shirt].\nHawk testified that when he went to [Petitioner\u2019s] home to arrest him,\n\n38\nthe first clothing items that Hawk saw on the floor in [Petitionet\u2019s]\nbedroom were [Ja pait of .. . jeans and al] . . . blue t-shirt.\n\n* * *\n\n[Petitionet\u2019s] proximity to the scene of the crime also supports the\n\nsufficiency of the State\u2019s identification evidence. ... [Police] stopped\n\nPetitioner approximately 150 yards from the gas station in question.\nWeber I, 971 A.2d at 155-56; see also Weber II, 38 A.3d at 278.\n\nViewing this evidence \u2014 testimony of a police officer who has known Petitioner for over\ntwenty years, surveillance video of the event, atrest photos, and Petitioner\u2019s courtroom appearance \u2014\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have identified Petitioner\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2. Suggestive identification\n\nPetitioner contends that the circumstances under which Officer Hawk identified him were\nimpermissibly suggestive and, therefore, the trial court violated his due process rights by not\nscteening \u201cHawk\u2019s testimony for reliability.\u201d (D.I. 105 at 105) The Supreme Court has established a\ntwo-patt test to evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s due process tights were violated by the admission\nof an out-of-coutt identification (\u201cBiggers test\u201d). See Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 238 (2012)\n(citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972)). The first step requires determining if the challenged\npretrial identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. See Perry, 565 U.S. at 238. If the\npretrial identification procedure is found to be impermissibly suggestive, then the second step of the\nBiggers test requires considering the totality of the circumstances to determine if the witness\u2019\nidentification was nonetheless teliable. Id. at 239. If, however, the first step of the Biggers test is not\nsatisfied because the identification procedure was not unduly suggestive, then the defendant\u2019s due\n\nptocess tights ate not violated by the admission of the out-of-court identification. Rather, the\n\n39\n\u201creliability of properly admitted eyewitness identification, like the other parts of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase, is a matter for the jury.\u201d Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 443 1.2 (1969); see also Perry, 565 U.S.\nat 239. Significantly, however, the \u201cDue Process Clause does not requite a preliminary judicial\ninquity into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured\nunder unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement.\u201d Perry, 565 U.S. at 248.\nIn this case, the Delaware Supreme Court framed Officer Hawk\u2019s identification under Biggers,\n\nnoting that test normally addresses \u201ca suggestion by police impressed upon a witness or victim to\nidentify a suspect,\u201d not a situation in which a police officer knew the defendant already and was\nthereby purportedly conditioned to identify the defendant. See Weber II, 38 A.3d at 276-77 & n.19\n(citing Biggers). The Delaware Supreme Court found Officer Hawk\u2019s identification was not\nsubject to suggestion:\n\nFirst, Hawk encountered [Petitioner] not as a victim of crime but in\n\nHawk\u2019s ptofessional capacity as a police officer, with an open\n\nobservant mind steeled against suggestion by training and experience.\n\nSecond, independent of this investigation, Hawk had a 20 year base of\n\nfamiliarity with [Petitioner\u2019s] physical chatactetistics from which he\n\ncould draw when assessing the surveillance footage.\nWeber II, 38 A.3d at 277. After determining that the circumstances of the instant case did not\nconstitute an impermissibly suggestive identification procedute, the Delaware Supreme Coutt\nproceeded to assess the reliability of Officer Hawk\u2019s identification of Petitioner under Delawate\u2019s\n\u201ctotality of citcumstances\u201d test:\n\n[T]he Sleepy\u2019s parking lot was well lit and Hawk had ample opportunity\n\nto observe [Petitionet\u2019s] physical characteristics shortly after the crime.\n\nHawk reviewed the surveillance video and made his identification less\n\nthan twenty-four hours after observing [Petitioner] in the parking lot.\n\nAs noted above, Hawk also had familiarity with [Petitioner\u2019s] appearance\n\nbefore making the out of court identification. Hawk testified that he\n\nhad met [Petitioner] several times before the current incident, dating\n\nback to 1984. Moreover, at trial, the jury had as evidence [Petitioner\u2019s]\n\n40\nattest photo and the surveillance footage, and could weigh the accuracy\n\nand reliability of Hawk\u2019s identification testimony for themselves. Taken\n\ntogether, these factots indicate that Hawk\u2019s identification of [Petitioner]\n\nwas not unteliable.\nId. The Delaware Supreme Coutt held that the Superior Court properly admitted Officer Hawk\u2019s\ntestimony identifying Petitioner because \u201cthe identification was neither impermissibly suggestive nor\nunteliable.\u201d Id.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision that the trial court did not violate Petitioner\u2019s due\nprocess tights by admitting Officer Hawk\u2019s identification was not contrary to, and did not involve an\nunteasonable application of, United States Supreme Court precedent, namely the two-part test\ndetived from Perry and B\u00e9ggers. The Delaware Supreme Court engaged in the type of thorough \u201cfact-\nspecific inquiry\u201d required under Perry and Biggers to determine if the identification ptocedure first\nqualified as an \u201cimpermissibly suggestive\u201d procedure implicating due process concerns. Once it\ndetermined that Officer Hawk\u2019s identification of Petitioner was based on his twenty-years of\npetsonal and professional knowledge of Petitioner\u2019s physical characteristics and was not the result of\nan impermissibly suggestive police procedure, the Delaware Supreme Court could have properly\nended its due process inquiry under Perry and Biggers. Nevertheless, the Delaware Supreme Coutt\nproceeded to consider the reliability of Officer Hawk\u2019s identification under Delawate\u2019s \u201ctotality of\ncitcumstances\u201d test, thereby going above and beyond the dictates of clearly established federal law.\n\nPetitioner also asserts that the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s decision was based on an\nunreasonable detetmination of facts under \u00a7 2254(d)(2). (D.I. 1-2 at 21-22) Petitioner first claims\nthe Delaware Supreme Court unreasonably determined Officer Hawk \u201chad a 20 year base of\n\nfamiliarity with [Petitioner\u2019s] physical characteristics from which he could draw.\u201d Weber II, 38\n\n41\nA.3d at 277; (D.I. 1-2 at 21) Petitioner does not dispute this ultimate fact, but takes issue with its\nimport: he argues that the \u201cseveral\u201d encounters between Petitioner and Officer Hawk since 1984\ncould have all been in 1984, or spaced out over the twenty years. Id. Petitioner also assetts the\nfactual determination that Officer Hawk had \u201can open observant mind steeled against suggestion by\ntraining and experience\u201d is not supported by the record. (D.I. 1-2 at 22) Petitioner, however, does\nnot ptovide any cleat and convincing evidence to rebut either of the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s\nfactual determinations. Therefore, the Court must presume those factual determinations ate cortect.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\n\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s decision that\nPetitioner\u2019s due process rights were not violated by Officer Hawk\u2019s identification does not warrant\ntelief under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n3. Absence of questioning regarding police officer\u2019s testimony during voir\ndite\n\nPetitioner asserts that the jury pool should have been questioned about its ability to\nimpattially evaluate a police officer\u2019s credibility. He contends that the absence of such questioning\nviolated his right to an impartial jury because the rest of the identification evidence was weak, and\nOfficer Hawk\u2019s identification was uncotroborated. (D.I. 1-2 at 42)\n\n\u201cThe Constitution .. . does not dictate a catechism for voir dire, but only that the defendant\nbe afforded an impartial jury. Even so, part of the guarantee of a defendant's tight to an impartial\njuty is an adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors.\u201d Morgan \u00bb. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729 (1992).\n\u201cHence, the exetcise of the trial coutt\u2019s discretion, and the restriction upon inquiries at the request\n\nof counsel, ate subject to the essential demands of fairness.\u201d Id.\n\n42\nThe tecord demonstrates that Petitioner did not request the trial court to ask potential jurors\nany such questions. (D.I. 2 at 3-5) The trial court did ask the jury pool, \u201cDo you have any bias or\nptejudice either for or against the State or the defendant?\u201d and whether they knew \u201cMark Hawk of\nthe Delawate State Police.\u201d (Id. at 6) As the Delaware Supreme Coutt concluded, Officer Hawk\u2019s\ntestimony was combined with Petitioner\u2019s attest photo and the surveillance footage, such that the\njuty could weigh the accuracy and reliability of Hawk\u2019s identification testimony for themselves. See\nWeber II, 38 A.3d at 277. Given these circumstances, the Court concludes that the trial coutt\u2019s\ndecision to proceed on broader voir dire questions regarding bias toward law enforcement, and\ntowatd Officer Hawk specifically, was not contrary to, or based on an unreasonable application of,\nMorgan.\n\nJ. Claim Eleven: Failure to Preserve Evidence and Provide Missing Evidence\nInstruction Violated Petitioner\u2019s Due Process Rights\n\nIn Claim Eleven, Petitioner contends that he was denied due process when law enforcement\nfailed to gather and preserve the shirt he was wearing at the time of his arrest. Relatedly, Petitioner\natgues that the trial court should have issued a missing evidence instruction. The Delawate Supreme\nCourt denied these arguments as meritless in Weber II. Therefore, Claim Eleven will only warrant\nhabeas relief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was contraty to, ot an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law.\n\nThe clearly established federal law governing Petitioner\u2019s missing evidence argument is the\nstandard articulated in Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988). In Youngblood, the United States\nSupreme Coutt held that the failure by police to presetve potentially useful evidence is not a denial\n\nof due process of law unless bad faith can be shown. See id. at 57-58. Potentially useful evidence is\n\n43\n\u201cevidentiary material of which no mote can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests,\nthe results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u201d Id. at 57.\n\nIn Petitionet\u2019s case, the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed and denied the instant claim\nunder Lol \u00bb. State, 611 A.2d 956 (Del. 1992), rather than under Youngblood. See Weber II, 38 A.3d at\n274-75. Lolly imposes a duty upon the State both to preserve and gather evidence that may be\nmaterial to a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, whereas Youngblood only imposes a duty to preserve such\nevidence. See 611 A.2d at 960. As a result, in Delawate, a missing evidence instruction may be\ntequired when the State fails to gather evidence, not just when it fails to preserve evidence.\u2019\nConsidering that the Delaware Supreme Coutt applied a stricter standard than the one atticulated in\nYoungblood, the Delaware Supreme Courtt\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established federal\nlaw.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision also did not involve an unreasonable application of\nYoungblood. As the Delaware Supreme Coutt noted, Petitioner did not assert that the State acted in\nbad faith, one of the required elements of a Youngblood claim. See Weber II, 38 A.3d at 275-76, n.10.\nThe Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s findings do not support a conclusion of bad faith:\n\nHawk testified that at the time of his arrest, [Petitioner] had nothing\non but his underwear. Hawk further testified that he grabbed the\nnearest clothing in [Petitionet\u2019s] room for [Petitioner] to put on before\ntaking him to Troop 2. Hawk grabbed a blue shirt and a pair of blue\njeans from the floor of [Petitionet\u2019s] bedroom. It was only for\nconvenience\u2019s sake that Hawk grabbed the nearest clothing available,\n\nwhich happened to be a blue shirt and blue jeans. Other than the fact\nthat the shirt was blue, the police had no reason to believe that the shirt\n[Petitioner] wore when arrested was the same shirt worn by the\n\nperpetrator depicted in the video surveillance footage. Furthermote,\nDetective James Spillion testified, that the blue shirt in the surveillance\n\nIn Delaware, a missing evidence instruction is commonly referred to as a Lolly ot Deberry\ninstruction. See Deberry v. State, 457 A.2d 744 (Del.1983). A missing evidence instruction requites\n\u201cthe jury to infer that, had the evidence been preserved [or gathered], it would have been\nexculpatoty to the defendant.\u201d Lunnon v. State, 710 A.2d 197, 199 (Del. 1998).\n\n44\nfootage displayed no identifying characteristics. Had it been the case\n\nthat the shirt in the video and the shitt Hawk grabbed for [Petitioner]\n\nwere in fact the same, that could not reasonably be interpreted as\n\npotentially exculpatory, because it would only serve to cement\n\n[Petitioner\u2019s] connection to the offense.\nWeber II, 38 A.3d at 275. The Delawate Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that law enforcement had no\nduty to ptesetve the shirt did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal\nlaw. In turn, given the Delaware state courts\u2019 determination that the police did not have a duty to\nptesetve Petitioner\u2019s blue shirt, the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\nptopetly denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a missing evidence instruction was not based on an\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law, which required a finding of bad faith to\nwattant a missing evidence instruction.\n\nPetitioner also argues the Delawate state court decisions unreasonably determined the facts\nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial court proceeding. According to Petitioner, the\nconclusion that the police grabbed the shit \u201cfor convenience\u2019s sake\u201d and that they had \u201cno teason\nto believe that the shirt [Petitioner] wore when attested was the same shirt worn by the perpetrator\ndepicted in the video surveillance footage\u201d is refuted by Officer Hawk\u2019s testimony identifying\nphotos of Petitioner taken in connection with his arrest. (D.I. 1-2 at 33) Officer Hawk\u2019s testimony,\nhowever, only provides that Petitioner was photographed in the clothing he put on when he was\nattested; it does not link that clothing to the crime or video surveillance. Given Petitionet\u2019s failure\nto provide cleat and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Court must defer to the Delawate state\ncoutts\u2019 factual finding that there was no evidence of bad faith in failing to preserve the shitt.\n\nAccordingly, the Court concludes the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s denial of Claim Eleven was\nnot contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law; nor was it based\nupon an unreasonable determination of facts.\n\n45\nK. Claim Twelve: IAC for Failing to Present Renunciation Defense\n\nIn Claim Twelve, Petitioner asserts that defense counsel\u2019s failure to comply with his explicit\ndirection to present a renunciation defense and/or request a renunciation instruction violated his\nSixth Amendment tight to counsel. Petitioner premises this argument on two separate but related\ntheories. First, he asserts that defense counsel\u2019s failure to follow his wishes wattants telief under\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Second, he contends that defense counsel\u2019s failure to\ncomply with his wishes violated his right of client autonomy, which was recently recognized by the\nSupreme Court in McCoy \u00bb. Louisiana, 138 S.Ct. 1500, 1508 (2018).\u00b0\n\n1. Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel argument\n\nPetitioner presented his ineffective assistance of counsel/Strick/and argument to the\nDelaware state courts in his first Rule 61 proceeding. The Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s\nineffective assistance of counsel/ Strickland claim as meritless, and the Delawate Supreme Coutt\naffirmed that decision on the basis of the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning. Therefore, the Strickland\nargument in Claim Twelve will only warrant relief if the Superior Coutt\u2019s denial of Claim Twelve was\neither contrary to, ot an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. See Wilson, 138\nS. Ct. at 1193-94.\n\nThe cleatly established federal law governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the\ntwo-pronged standard enunciated in Sirick/and and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510\n\n(2003). Under the first Strickland ptong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s\n\n8Petitioner did not assert his right to client autonomy argument in his first or second amended\nPetitions. (D.I. 58; D.I. 63) Instead, he presented the argument in a separate habeas petition in this\nCourt. The Court administratively closed the separate 2019 case and stated that the argument\nshould be taised in the instant proceeding since Petitioner was challenging the same 2004\nconviction. See Weber v. Metzger, Civ. A. No. 19-697-MN, at D.I. 5 (D. Del. Aug. 8, 2019). Petitioner\nthen presented the instant McCay argument in his Supplement to the first amended Petition. (DI.\n113)\n\n46\nteptesentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d with reasonableness being judged\nunder professional norms prevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n688. Under the second Sirick/and prong, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.\u201d Id. at 694. A teasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine\nconfidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. A court can choose to address the prejudice prong before the\ndeficient performance prong, and reject an ineffective assistance of counsel claim solely on the\nground that the defendant was not prejudiced. See id. at 698.\n\nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must make\nconcrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them ot risk summary dismissal. See Wells \u00bb.\nPetsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley \u00bb. Petsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987).\nAlthough not insurmountable, the Strickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \u201cstrong\nptesumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nThe Superior Court denied Petitioner\u2019s argument that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to present a renunciation defense, explaining:\n\n[Petitioner] presented an \u201cidentity defense\u201d and through counsel,\nargued that he was not the perpetrator of the crime. Although\ndefendants may taise inconsistent defenses, in light of the fact that\nwhen ptesented at a show-up identification, the victim could not\nidentify [Petitioner] as the man that assaulted him, it was certainly a\nreasonable strategy for trial counsel to present a defense to the juty\nthat the wrong man was on trial. In order for trial counsel to present\na tenunciation defense, he would have had to directly contradict that\nstrategy by admitting his client was there, but had chosen to walk away\nafter failing to successfully rob the victim.\n\n[Petitioner] was convicted of Attempted First Degree Robbery and\nAttempted First Degree Carjacking, which required a showing that he\n\n47\nintentionally engaged in a substantial step planned to culminate in the\ncommission of the crime. The video surveillance and witness\ntestimony showed that [Petitioner] walked up to the victim, grabbed\nhim with both hands in an attempt to get the car keys, and told the\nvictim he had a gun. It was only after the victim resisted that\n[Petitioner] walked away. The crime was therefore completed before\n[Petitioner] walked away and he did not voluntarily renounce his acts\nwithout intervention. A teviewing court should not second-guess the\ntrial strategy of trial counsel. In light of the evidence presented, and\nthe great weight and deference given to tactical decisions by the trial\nattorney, it was objectively reasonable for trial counsel to pursue the\nselected strategy. The evidence supported the convictions and it was\nnot unteasonable for trial counsel to putsue a strategy of mistaken\nidentity and omit a renunciation defense.\n\nState v. Weber, 2017 WL 3638209, at *5 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 22. 2017).\n\nWith respect to the first prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, a \u201cstate court decision is contrary\nto clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in\nSupreme Coutt precedent, or if it confronts a set of facts that ate materially indistinguishable from a\ndecision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless attives at a result different from that reached by\nthe Supreme Court.\u201d Eley \u00bb. Erickson, 712 F.3d 837, 846 (3d Cir. 2013). Here, the Superior Court\ndecision was not conttaty to Strickland because it correctly identified the Strickland standard\napplicable to Claim Twelve. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 406 (\u201c[A] run-of-the-mill state-court decision\napplying the correct legal rule from [Supreme Coutt] cases to the facts of a prisonet\u2019s case [does] not\nfit comfortably within \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause.\u201d).\n\nThe Court must also detetmine if the Superior Court reasonably applied the Strickland\nstandard to the facts of Petitionet\u2019s case. When performing the second prong of the \u00a7 2254(d)\ninquiry, the Coutt must review the Superior Court\u2019s decision with respect to Petitioner\u2019s ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel Claims through a \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d lens.\u201d See R\u00e9chter, 562 U.S. at 105. The\n\n\u00b0As explained by the Richter Coutt,\n48\nrelevant question \u201cis not whether counsel\u2019s actions wete reasonable [but rathet] . .. whether there is\nany reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Svrick/and\u2019s deferential standard.\u201d Id. In turn, when\nassessing prejudice under Stick/and, the question is \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result would\nhave been different\u201d but for counsel\u2019s performance, and the \u201clikelihood of a different result must be\nsubstantial, not just conceivable.\u201d Id. Finally, when viewing a state coutt\u2019s determination that a\nStrickland claim lacks merit through the lens of \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief is precluded \u201cso long\nas faitminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d Id. at 101.\n\nDefense counsel\u2019s failure to present a renunciation defense did not fall below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness, because the facts did not support a renunciation jury instruction.\nPursuant to 11 Del. Code \u00a7 541, \u201cit is an affirmative defense that, under circumstances manifesting a\nvoluntary and complete renunciation of the criminal purpose, the accused avoided the commission\nof the crime attempted by abandoning the criminal effort and, if mete abandonment was insufficient\nto accomplish avoidance, by taking further and affirmative steps which prevented the commission of\nthe crime.\u201d Hete, Petitioner\u2019s conduct did not comport with \u00a7 541, because Petitioner walked away\nfrom Naspo affer attempting to steal his keys and threatening him. Thus, defense counsel did not\nperform deficiently by not pursuing an unavailable defense and instruction.\n\nPetitioner also cannot demonstrate ptejudice. Even if defense counsel had pursued the\n\ndefense and instruction, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the Superior Court would have given\n\nThe standards cteated by Strickland and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly\ndeferential,\u201d and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.\nThe Strickland standatd is a general one, so the range of reasonable\napplications is substantial. Federal habeas courts must guard against\nthe danger of equating unreasonableness under Strickland with\nunteasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 105 (internal citations omitted).\n\n49\nthe instruction, ot that thete is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have\nbeen different if the jury had been instructed on renunciation. Accordingly, the Court will deny the\nStrickland argument in Claim Twelve for failing to satisfy \u00a7 2254(d).\n2. McCoy right of client autonomy atgument\n\nIn McCoy v. Louisiana, the Supteme Court held that defense counsel\u2019s concession to his\nclient\u2019s guilt in order to avoid the death penalty violated the defendant's right to autonomy. See\nMcCoy, 138 S.Ct. at 1503 (\u201c[The] Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the tight to choose the\nobjective of his defense and to insist that his counsel refrain from admitting guilt, even when\ncounsel\u2019s expetience-based view is that confessing guilt offers the defendant the best chance to\navoid the death penalty.\u201d). Autonomy claims are premised on violations of a defendant\u2019s \u201cright to\nmake the fundamental choices about his own defense.\u201d Id. at 1511. The \u201ctight to defend\u201d granted\nto the defendant \u201cpersonally\u201d in the Sixth Amendment protects not only his right to self-\nrepresentation,\u201d but also ensures that if the defendant chooses to be represented by counsel he\nretains the \u201c[alutonomy to decide . . . the objective of the defense.\u201d Id at 1508. A represented\ndefendant sutrendets control to counsel over tactical decisions at trial while retaining the tight to be\nthe \u201cmaster\u201d of his own defense. See id.; see also Faretta, 422 U.S. at 820. While counsel makes\ndecisions concerning matters of trial management, such as \u201cthe objections to make, the witnesses to\ncall, and the arguments to advance,\u201d the defendant has \u201cthe ultimate authority to make certain\nfundamental decisions regarding the case.\u201d Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983). Fundamental\ndecisions \u201care not strategic choices about how best to achieve a client\u2019s objectives; they are choices\n\nabout what the client\u2019s objectives in fact are.\u201d McCoy, 138 S. Ct. at 1508. Autonomous decisions\n\nSee Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834 (1975).\n\n\u201cGonzalez v. United States, 553 U.S. 242, 249 (2008).\n50\nthat are reserved exclusively for defendant include whether to plead guilty, waive the right to a jury\ntrial, testify in one\u2019s own behalf, take an appeal, and admit guilt of a charged crime. See id; see also\nJones, 463 U.S. at 751.\n\nAs explained by the Third Circuit:\n\n[I]Jn McCoy v. Louisiana, the Supreme Coutt clarified the line between\ntactical and fundamental decisions. On the one hand, \u201cstrategic\nchoices about how best to achievea client\u2019s objectives\u201d are\ndecisions for lawyers, so we teview them for ineffectiveness. On the\nother hand, \u201cchoices about what the client\u2019s objectives in\nfact are\u201d belong to defendants themselves, and violating defendant's\ntight to make those choices is structural  ertot.\n\nUnited States v. Wilson, 960 F.3d 136, 143 (3d Cir. 2020) (emphasis in original).\nHere, Petitioner contends that defense counsel\u2019s refusal to assert a renunciation defense\nviolated his right to client autonomy under McCoy. (D.I. 113) He states:\n\nIt has been my firm and oft-repeated position that with respect to this\nmatter, I never intended to consummate the offense of robbety \u2014 and\nthat any intent I may have had was immediately renunciated in this\nthree and seven-tenths of a second incident. ... I never vacillated in\nmy firm intent to putsue this line of defense. My trial attorney was\nvery well aware of my intent and agreed to present the defense at the\nvery start of trial preparations.\n\n* * *\n\nThe decision of whether to pursue the renunciation defense was thus\ntesetved for [Petitioner] and only [Petitioner] to make. Defense\ncounsel\u2019s last-minute refusal to honor [Petitionet\u2019s] firm decision to\npresent this affirmative defense, a decision which was previously\ndocumented with the Court, constituted a \u201cstructural error\u201d of\n[Petitioner\u2019s] autonomy.\n\n(DI. 113 at 5-6)\n\nPetitioner presented his McCoy/right to client autonomy atgument in his second Rule 61\nproceeding. The Superior Court dismissed Petitionet\u2019s McCoy/client autonomy argument as\nuntimely under Rule 61(i)(1). By applying the procedural bats of Rule 61(i)(1), the Delaware\n\n51\nSupreme Coutt articulated a \u201cplain statement\u201d under Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 263-64 (1984), that\nits decision rested on state law grounds. This Court has consistently held that Rule 61()(1) is an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule barring federal habeas review. See, e.g. Trice v. Pierce,\n2016 WL 2771123, at *4 (D. Del. May 13, 2016). Thetefore, the Court cannot review the merits of\nthe instant McCoy/autonomy argument in Claim Twelve absent a showing of cause for the default,\nand prejudice resulting therefrom, or that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the claim is not\nteviewed.\n\nPetitioner attempts to establish cause on the basis that he could not have raised the instant\nargument in his first Rule 61 motion because McCay was not decided until 2018. Assuming, arguendo,\nthat the right of client autonomy acknowledged in McCoy constitutes a newly created rule of\nconstitutional law rather than an extension of an already existing rule, the timing of the McCoy\ndecision does not establish cause ot ptejudice because the Supreme Coutt has not made McCoy\nretroactively applicable on collateral review. In turn, the miscarriage of justice exception to the\nptocedural default doctrine does not apply to excuse Petitioner\u2019s ptocedutal default, because he has\nnot provided new reliable evidence of his actual innocence.\n\nEven if Petitioner\u2019s right to client autonomy atgument should not be considered as barred\nfrom review under the exhaustion doctrine, the argument does not entitle Petitioner to habeas relief.\nOnce again, to the extent McCyy established a new constitutional right, Petitioner\u2019s instant argument\nis unavailing because the Supreme Court has not made McCoy retroactively applicable to cases on\nfederal collateral review. To the extent McCoy did not establish a new constitutional tight but, rather,\nexpanded the existing right to effective assistance of counsel to include a client\u2019s right to autonomy,\nPetitioner\u2019s argument is unavailing because the facts of his case are distinguishable from the facts in\nMcCoy's case. In McCay, defense counsel conceded McCoy\u2019s factual guilt with the hope of securing a\n\n52.\nlife sentence despite McCoy\u2019s goal of obtaining an acquittal. In Petitioner\u2019s case, defense counsel\ndid not concede Petitionet\u2019s guilt and actually argued that Petitioner was not the perpetrator of the\ncrime. See Weber, 2017 WL 3638209, at *5. When viewed in context with the evidence presented, it\nappeats that defense counsel reasonably and tactically decided that pursuing an \u201cidentity defense\u201d\nrather than a \u201crenunciation defense\u201d was mote likely to obtain Petitionet\u2019s objective (4\u00a2., acquittal).\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Petitioner\u2019s McCoy/client autonomy argument lacks merit and\ndoes not warrant relief.\n\nL. Claim Thirteen: Sentencing Enhancement Violated Due Process\n\nPetitioner was convicted in July 2001 of second degree forgery and misdemeanor theft. He\nwas sentenced to 30 days of imprisonment for each count. The 30-day sentence imposed by the\nSuperior Court did not meet the jurisdictional minimum for appeals set by the Delawate state\nconstitution. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s appeal from those convictions was dismissed. See Weber \u00bb State,\n812 A.2d 225 (Table), 2002 WL 31235418, at *1 (Del. Oct. 4, 2002).\n\nThe second degtee forgery conviction was used as one of the predicate offenses to declare\nPetitioner an habitual offender. In Claim Thirteen, Petitioner argues that his due process rights were\nviolated by using the 2001 second degree forgery conviction to enhance the sentence in this case\nbecause he had been denied the right to appeal that conviction.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court\ndenied the argument in Claim Thirteen as meritless in Petitionet\u2019s initial direct appeal. See Weber I,\n\n971 A.2d at 160. Petitioner subsequently presented the same argument to the Superior Court in a\n\n2 During the pendency of this proceeding, Petitioner filed a Motion to Bifurcate and/or Obtain a\nSummary Judgment on Claim Thirteen. (D.I. 119) The Court denied the Motion on Match 31,\n2022, but informed Petitioner that it would consider the argument in Claim Thirteen presented in\nthat Motion when it considered his Petition as a whole. (See D.I. 122) The instant discussion of\nClaim Thirteen includes the argument presented in the Motion to Bifurcate/Obtain Summary\n\nJudgment.\n53\nmotion for telief of judgment. The Superior Court denied the motion, and the Delaware Supreme\nCourt affirmed that decision. See Weber v. State, 2019 WL 3268813, at *1 (Del. July 19, 2019) (rearg\u2019t\ndenied Aug. 6, 2019). Given these citcumstances, Claim Thirteen will only warrant relief if the\nDelawate Supreme Coutt\u2019s decisions were either contrary to, or an unteasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law.\n\nIn 2009 (Weber I), the Delaware Supreme Coutt rejected the same due process argument\nPetitioner presents in Claim Thirteen, explaining:\n\n[Petitionet] could have petitioned for post-conviction relief under\nSuperior Court Criminal Rule 35, which provides that the Superior\nCoutt \u201cmay cottect an illegal sentence at any time . . .,\u201d [Petitioner] has\nnot explained why he did not seek Rule 35 telief. Had [Petitioner]\nsought Rule 35 relief and been denied, that denial would have been\nappealable to this Coutt.\n\n[Petitioner] also could have sought certiorari review of his Forgery\nconviction. The scope of certiorari review is limited but includes an\nexamination of jurisdiction, errors of law, and mistakes on the face of\nthe record. [Petitioner\u2019s] failure to pursue Rule 35 telief from his\nForgery conviction or to seek a writ of certiorari patently detracts from\n[Petitioner\u2019s] due process claims.\n\nItis clear that the United States Constitution does not guarantee a tight\nto appeal a state law criminal conviction. The United States Supreme\nCourt, however, has specifically held that \u201cthe States must afford\nptisoners some \u2018clearly defined method by which they may raise claims\nof denial of federal rights.\u201d\u201d Although the United States Supreme\nCoutt has held that the right to appellate review of predicate offenses\nis not required to enhance a sentence under a recidivism statute, that\nCourt has not made a similar pronouncement with respect to\nsentencing enhancements. Rather, the Court currently appears to rely\non the \u201cnumerous opportunities to challenge the constitutionality of\n[ptedicate] convictions [in state courts]\u201d as sufficient to protect the due\nprocess tights of criminal defendants. Hete, [Petitioner] could have\nassetted his federal rights in State Court through a motion for post-\nconviction relief or a writ of certiorari.\n\n54\nWe conclude that [Petitioner\u2019s] 2001 conviction for Forgery Second is\na conviction for purposes of the habitual offender statute, and that the\nunavailability of a ditect appeal does not change this result.\n\nWeber I, 971 A.2d at 159-60 (cleaned up).\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law. Although States must provide prisoners some \u201cclearly\ndefined method by which they may taise claims of denial of federal rights,\u201d \u201cthere is no federal\nconstitutional tight to state appellate review of state criminal convictions.\u201d Evstelle v. Dorrough, 420\nU.S. 534, 536 (1975). As the Delaware Supreme Coutt explicitly and thoroughly noted in its\ndecision, even though Petitioner was precluded from appealing his 2001 forgery conviction directly\nto the Delaware Supteme Coutt, he could have challenged his forgery conviction via two other post-\nconviction vehicles. The existence of these alternate avenues of review undercuts his instant due\nptocess argument. Therefore, the Court concludes that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s denial of\nClaim Thirteen does not warrant relief under \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court has held that, when a state prisonet\u2019s curtent sentence was\nenhanced due to a previous unconstitutional conviction, habeas review of the enhanced current\nsentence is generally unavailable when the previous conviction is\n\nno longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because\nthe defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available\n(or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), the conviction may\nbe regarded as conclusively valid. If that conviction is later used to\nenhance a criminal sentence, the defendant generally may not challenge\nthe enhanced sentence through a petition under \u00a7 2254 on the ground\nthat the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.\n\nLackawanna Cnty. Dist. Att'y v. Coss, 532 U.S. 394, 402-04 (2001). The only exception to this rule\n\nexpressly recognized by the Supreme Coutt is for a claim that the prior conviction was\n\nYoung v. Ragen, 337 U.S. 235, 239 (1949).\n55\nunconstitutional because there was a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment\ntight to counsel as set forth in Gideon v, Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). See Lackawanna, 532. US. at\n404; Daniels v. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 382 (2001). In this case, Petitioner did not pursue\ncollateral remedies for his 2001 forgery conviction and he does not taise a Sixth Amendment claim\nin connection with his 2001 forgery conviction. Therefore, the Court alternatively denies Claim\nThirteen for failing to state an issue cognizable on federal habeas teview.\n\nM. Claim Fourteen: Use of 2001 Forgery Conviction to Enhance Sentence Violated\nEqual Protection Rights\n\nIn Claim Fourteen, Petitioner contends that the State violated his right to equal protection\nby using the 2001 forgery conviction to enhance his sentence, because the forgery offense could\nhave been charged as misdemeanor or felony. He asserts, \u201c[c]ompating [Petitioner\u2019s] absence of any\ntight to a direct appeal against the State\u2019s \u2018absolute right to appeal\u2019 leads to the ineluctable\nconclusion that he was not afforded equal protection of the law in his forgery case since superior\nappeal rights were available to the State.\u201d (D.I. 58-3 at 6)\n\nPetitioner presented this argument to the Superior Coutt in his Rule 61 motion, which\ndenied the argument as procedurally barred. See Weber v. State, 197 A.3d 492 (Table), 2018 WL\n5993473, at *1 (Del. Nov. 13, 2018). On post-conviction appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court did\nnot address the Supetior Court\u2019s procedural ruling but, instead, denied the instant equal protection\nargument as metitless. See id. Given these citcumstances, Claim Fourteen will only warrant habeas\nrelief if the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision was either contrary to, ot an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law.\n\n\u201c{T]he concept of equal protection as embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment does not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but tather that there be some\n\n56\n\u2018tational basis\u2019 for the statutory distinctions made, or that they \u2018have some relevance to the purpose\nfot which the classification is made.\u201d\u201d Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 422 (1974) (cleaned up).\n\u201cUnder traditional equal protection principles, distinctions need only be drawn in such a mannet as\nto bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state end. Classifications are set aside only if they\nate based solely on reasons totally untelated to the pursuit of the State\u2019s goals and only if no grounds\ncan be conceived to justify them.\u201d Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957, 962-63 (1982). Courts deviate\nfrom traditional equal protection principles, however, and apply strict scrutiny if the challenged\nstatute discriminates against a suspect class of persons or burdens the exercise of a fundamental\nconstitutional right in a disctiminatory manner. See id. at 963.\n\nWhen denying Claim Fourteen, the Delaware Supreme Court opined:\n\nIn 2001, [Petitioner] was convicted of a felony for the forgery of a $300\ncheck, which served as one of the predicate offenses supporting the\nSuperior Court\u2019s determination that he was a habitual offender.\n[Petitioner] argues that his equal protection tights were violated\nbecause, (1) after his conviction for forgery, he had different appeal\ntights than the State of Delaware would have had, and (2) had he been\ninstead convicted for unlawful use of a payment catd, which is only a\nmisdemeanor, such a conviction would not have served as a predicate\nfelony to support the Superiot Court\u2019s determination that he was a\nhabitual offender. Thete is, however, an obviously rational basis for\nthe General Assembly to draw distinctions between the appeal rights\nof convicted offenders and the State\u2019s appeal rights in criminal cases.\nLikewise, there is an obviously rational basis for the General Assembly\nto determine that the unlawful use of a payment card is a less serious\noffense than check forgery. It was therefore objectively reasonable for\nhis trial counsel to refrain from making this meritless equal protection\nclaim.\n\nWeber, 2018 WL 5993473, at *1.\n\nIn this proceeding, Petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Coutt\u2019s decision is\ncontrary to, and an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, because the Delaware\nSupreme Court \u201cfailed to consider the controlling United States Supreme Coutt Law\u201d as set forth in\n\n57\nSkinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942). (D.1. 58-2 at 29) In Skinner, after applying strict scrutiny,\nthe Supreme Coutt held a sterilization law that applied to a class of \u201chabitual criminals,\u201d but not to\nanother class who had committed the same quality of offense, violated the Equal Protection Clause\nof the 14th Amendment. See id. at 541. Explaining that \u201c[mlartiage and procteation ate\nfundamental to the very existence and survival of the race,\u201d the S&nner Coutt held that strict\nsctutiny applied because the \u201clegislation . . . involves one of the basic civil rights of man.\u201d Id. at 541.\n\nPetitioner appears to argue that the Delaware Supreme Coutt should have applied strict\nscrutiny when reviewing the different appeal rights afforded to him and the State in the forgery case.\nHis argument is unavailing. Since Petitioner\u2019s case did not involve a fundamental right, strict\nscrutiny review of Delaware\u2019s forgery and unlawful use of a credit card statutes was not required, not\nwas sttict scrutiny review of the different appeal rights for convicted offenders and the State\u2019s appeal\ntights in ctiminal cases. As the Delaware Supreme Court held, there was a rational basis to draw\ndistinctions between the appeal tights of convicted offenders and the State, and there was a rational\nbasis for determining that the unlawful use of a payment catd is a less setious offense than check\nforgery. Accordingly, Claim Fourteen does not warrant habeas relief.\n\nN. Claim Fifteen: IAC Failure to Advise Petitioner of Habitual Status\n\nIn Claim Fifteen, Petitioner contends that defense counsel ptovided ineffective assistance by\nfailing to advise him that, if he were to be convicted of attempted robbery, he was eligible to be\nsentenced as an habitual offender under 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4214(a). Petitioner asserts that he would\nhave accepted a plea offer made by the State had he been aware of his habitual offender status.\n\nThe State contends that Claim Fifteen is procedurally defaulted because Petitioner did not\n\nraise it in the state courts in his post-conviction proceedings. Petitioner concedes he did not exhaust\n\n58\nstate remedies. The State also contends that Petitioner\u2019s argument is meritless. In an exercise of\njudicial efficiency, the Court will proceed to the merits of the Claim.\nIn 2005, after a jury found Petitioner guilty of attempted robbery and attempted carjacking,\n\nthe State moved to have him declared an habitual offender pursuant to 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4214(a).\nDefense counsel filed a response in opposition to the State\u2019s motion. The Superior Court granted\nthe State\u2019s motion and sentenced Petitioner as an habitual offender. Petitioner appealed, and the\nDelawate Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial. Prior to his second trial in 2010, the\nState made plea offers that did not contemplate having Petitioner being declared an habitual\noffender. At that juncture, Petitioner clearly knew about his status as an habitual offender, having\nbeen already declared an habitual offender in the same case. Petitioner nonetheless rejected the\nState\u2019s offers and elected to go to trial. After he was convicted a second time, Petitioner moved to\nenforce the priot plea offer made by the State. Denying Petitioner\u2019s motion, the Superior Court\nrecounted the sequence of events as follows:\n\nThe defendant seeks to enforce the original plea offer made to him by\n\nthe State. This plea agreement would have required the defendant to\n\nplead guilty to Attempted Robbety Second and the State would\n\nrecommend a sentence of five years at level five. In response, the\n\ndefendant requested the State to agree that he was entitled to credit\n\ntime of approximately two yeats. The State refused to agree, and the\n\noriginal offer was rejected. A few days later, in response to defendant\u2019s\n\ncredit time request, the State modified its offer and agreed that the\n\ndefendant could receive the credit time but in doing so would increase\n\nits Level 5 recommendation to seven yeats. This would ensure the\n\ndefendant would serve the five years the State was seeking. The\n\ndefendant rejected the modified offer and the case proceeded to trial.\nWeber, 2010 WL 5343153, at *1.\n\nThe fact that Petitioner had already been declared an habitual offender following his first\n\nconviction demonstrates that Petitioner was awate of his status as an habitual offender when he\n\n5D\ntejected the State\u2019s subsequent plea offers presented prior to his second trial in 2010. Petitioner\ndoes not provide any evidence to support his statement that defense counsel advised him that he\nwas not an habitual offender. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Fifteen as metitless.\n\nO. Claim Sixteen: 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4214 is Unconstitutionally Vague\n\nNext, Petitioner argues that his conviction for attempted robbery is not an offense that\nqualified him for habitual offender treatment under 11 Del. Code \u00a7 4214(a). He asserts that the\nabsence of the term \u201cattempt\u201d in subsection (a) of the 2004 version of the statute that was applied in\nhis case tendets it \u201cunconstitutionally vague and ambiguous.\u201d (D.I. 58-3 at 21; D.L 117 at 5)\nAccording to Petitioner, the fact that the 2016 version of \u00a7 4214(c) \u201cis the equivalent of\n\u00a7 4214(a)(2004) with the exception that\u201d the 2016 version of \u00a7 4214(c ) includes the word \u201cattempt\u201d\ndemonstrates that the State and Delawate General Assembly \u201crecognized the merits of [his] claim\nthat the statute was vague and ambiguous.\u201d\"* (D.I. 117 at 6-7)\n\nIt is well-established that \u201c[s]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law,\u201d and claims\nbased on ettors of state law ate not cognizable on habeas review. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-\n68 (1991). Although Petitioner couches a portion of the instant argument in constitutional terms,\nthe essence of his argument is that the Superior Court misapplied the habitual offender\nenhancement in his case. The Delawate Supreme Court has previously rejected the same argument\nPetitioner makes here, and held that attempted robbery is a qualified offense under \u00a7 4214:\n\nUnder Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 531, an \u201c[a]ttempt to commit a crime\nis an offense of the same grade and degtee as the most setious offense\n\nwhich the accused is found guilty of attempting.\u201d Moreover, under\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 832(c), a twenty-year Level V sentence\n\n\u201cDuring the pendency of this proceeding, Petitioner filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\non Claim Sixteen (D.I. 117) and Motion to Bifurcate Claim Sixteen (D.I. 119). The Court denied\n\nboth Motions on Match 31, 2022, but informed Petitioner that it would consider the supplemental\n\natgument to Claim Sixteen presented in those Motions when it considered his Petition as a whole.\n\n(See D.I. 122) The Court\u2019s instant discussion of Claim Sixteen includes his supplemental argument.\n60\n\u201cappllies] to attempted robbery in the first degree as well as robbery in\n\nthe first degree.\u201d Because Robbety in the First Degree carries a\n\nstatutory maximum of twenty years\u2019 incarceration at Level V, the\n\nSuperior Court was required, at a minimum, to impose the twenty-yeat\n\nLevel V maximum sentence for attempted robbery, once Hartis had\n\nbeen declared an habitual offender.\nHarris v. State, 840 A.2d 1242, 1243-44 (Del. 2004). In short, Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the Superior\nCoutt\u2019s interpretation and application of well-settled Delaware law does not present an issue\ncognizable on federal habeas review. See Lewis \u00bb. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990) (\u201cFederal habeas\ncorpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\u201d); Johnson v. Rosemeyer, 117 F. 3d 104, 109 (3d Cit.\n1997) (\u201c[A] state court\u2019s misapplication of its own law does not . . . taise a constitutional claim\u201d); see\nalso Mullaney, 421 U.S. at 691 (\u201cFederal courts entertaining petitions for writs of habeas corpus are\nbound by the construction placed on a State\u2019s criminal statutes by the courts of that State\u201d).\nTherefore, the Court will deny Claim Sixteen for failing to assert a proper basis for federal habeas\nrelief.\n\nP. Claim Seventeen: Overall Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\nIn his final Claim, Petitioner assetts \u201c[i]nsofar as Grounds I through XI in the original and\n\namended petitions and Grounds XII through XVI in the supplemental petition implicate ineffective\nassistance of counsel, [Petitioner] hereby raises that claim. ... [Petitioner] requests the opportunity\nto btief this claim in the event if it is feasible to do so.\u201d (D.I. 58-4 at 11) The State responds that\nPetitionet\u2019s conclusory and vague allegation wattants summaty dismissal. (D.I77 at 11) Petitioner\u2019s\nTraverse, filed nine months after the State\u2019s assertion that Claim Seventeen is too vague to wartant\nrelief, does not provide any additional briefing for Claim Seventeen. (D.I. 105 at 146-47) Instead,\n\nPetitioner references his voluminous filings (exceeding 400 pages) in an apparent attempt to justify\n\nhis failure to plead his ineffective assistance of counsel claim with sufficient particularity. (D.I. 105\n\n61\nat 147) Petitioner also concedes he never presented Claim Seventeen to the Delaware state courts,\nbut avers that he is excused from any exhaustion requirements because \u201cpostconviction ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims are not cognizable in Delaware courts.\u201d (D.I. 105 at 146) He argues:\n\nWas [Petitioner] required to add another 30-pages just to argue the\n\nStrickland test which simply asks the questions of whether the default\n\nconstituted error on the part of counsel and whether [he] suffered\n\nptejudice as a result? Has the criminal justice system\u2019s acumen\n\ndeteriorated to such a level that such hypert-technical nuances ate\n\nvalued mote than common-sense truth, and justice?\n(DI. 105 at 147)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s general reference to any alleged arguments implicating ineffective assistance of\ncounsel throughout his voluminous filings is not sufficiently specific to avoid summary dismissal,\nespecially when compared with his allegations of ineffective assistance in Claims Twelve and Fifteen.\nThe Court cannot speculate as to the particular arguments and facts Petitioner would assert to\nsuppott his general overall allegation of ineffective assistance, nor can the Coutt speculate as to how\nPetitioner would demonstrate prejudice caused by counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance. If the\nCoutt were to consider Petitioner\u2019s general ineffective assistance allegation as presented, the Coutt\u2019s\ndetermination that the Claims in the Petition lack merit would preclude finding ineffective assistance\nwith respect to those issues. See, \u00a2.g., United States v. Sanders, 165 F.3d 248, 253 (3d Cir. 1999) (\u201cThere\ncan be no Sixth Amendment deprivation of effective counsel based on an attorney\u2019s failure to raise a\nmeritless argument.\u201d).\n\nMoteover, it is Petitionet\u2019s burden to demonstrate cause and prejudice to overcome his\nfailure to exhaust state remedies for Claim Seventeen, and his statement that he is excused from any\n\nexhaustion requirements with respect to any ineffective assistance on the part of post-conviction\n\ncounsel does not approach the threshold requirement. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750\n\n62\n(1991) (explaining that petitioner has butden of demonstrating cause and prejudice). Thus, the\nCourt concludes that Claim Seventeen does not warrant habeas relief.\nVv. MOTION\n\nPetitioner has filed a Motion to Expand the Record in order to provide background\ninformation concerning Claim Eight. (D.I. 124) The Court will grant the Motion, and notes that it\nconsidered the background information when it addressed Petitioner\u2019s contentions in Claim Eight.\nVI. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether to\nissue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A\ncertificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the\ndenial of a constitutional right\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthat reasonable jutists would find the district\ncoutt\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not wattant relief. Reasonable jurists\nwould not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the Court will not issue a certificate of\nappealability.\n\nVII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed, the Court will deny the Petition without holding an evidentiary\n\nhearing. An apptoprtiate Order will be entered.\n\n63\n"}
