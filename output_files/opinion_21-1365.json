D.I. 52. \nThe Court has considered the parties' briefing, D.I. 53; D.I. 56; D.I. 61. For the reasons explained \nbelow, the Court grants-in-part and denies-in-part the Motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn September 28, 2021, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant Ramot at Tel Aviv \nUniversity, Ltd. (\"Ramot\") seeking \"declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202 with \nrespect to [the '872 patent].\" D.I. 1 at 1. On February 7, 2022, Ramot filed its Answer and \nCounterclaims . D.I. 8. On March 7, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their Answer to Ramot's Counterclaims. \nD.I. 11. However , as recounted in the Court's recent Memorandum Opinion, this case is one of \nseveral between the parties now before this Court. See D.I. 51. On February 26, 2021, \"Ramot \nsued Acacia, alone, ... for infringement \" of two patents. See D.I. 51 at 2. On May 24, 2022, \nRamot's United States Patent No. 11,342,998 (the '\"998 patent\") issued and, the same day at 12:01 \na.m., Plaintiffs \"brought another declaratory judgment action against Ramot in this Court and \n1 alleged that Cisco and Acacia did not infringe the newly-issued '998 patent[.]\" D.I. 51 at 3 (citing \nC.A. No. 21-295; C.A. No. 22-674). The Court previously explained that, in C.A. No. 22-674, \nPlaintiffs \"abused the Declaratory Judgment Act by running to the courthouse at 12:01 a.m. on the \nday that Ramot's patent was released .\" D.I. 51 at 10. \nPlaintiffs filed two petitions for IPR on the '872 patent on February 16, 2022. D.I. 53 at 4; \nsee D.l. 56 at 1 (not contesting those facts). The two petitions collectivel y cover all claims of the \n'872 patent. D.I. 53 at 4. On October 5, 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") \ninstituted IPRs for both petitions. D.I. 53-1, Exs. 1 & 2 (PTAB's decision granting IPR petitions). \nFinal written decisions on the two instituted IPRs are due by October 5, 2023. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n316(a)(l 1) (imposing a one-year timeframe , but permitting an extension for \"good cause\"). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"Motions to stay invoke the broad discretionary powers of the court.\" Cellectis S.A. v. \nPrecision Biosciences , 883 F. Supp. 2d 526, 532 (D. Del. 2012). Courts generally consider three \nfactors to determine whether a stay is appropriate : (1) whether granting the stay will simplify the \nissues for trial; (2) the status of the litigation , particularl y whether discovery is complete and a trial \ndate has been set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to suffer undue prejudice \nfrom any delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage . See Am. Axle & Mfg, Inc. \nv. Neapco Holdings LLC, 2021 WL 616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing Ethicon LLC v. \nIntuitive Surgical, Inc., 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2019)). The parties agree these \nfactors apply. D.I. 53 at 5; D.I. 56 at 3. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nFor the reasons stated below, the Court grants-in-part and denies-in-part Plaintiff's Motion. \n2 The first stay factor-whether granting the stay will simplify the issues for trial-weighs \nin favor of a stay. The PTAB has instituted IPR proceedings on all asserted claims for the '872 \npatent. Ramot argues that Plaintiffs' claims of non-infringement , inequitable conduct, and certain \nchallenges under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 are not before the PTAB. D.I. 56 at 6. Ramot also asserts that \nit will not amend any claims of the '872 patent during the IPR process and that any invalidation of \nclaims by the PT AB \"would have the same ordinary and minimal impact as the ordinary reduction \nin asserted claims that occurs in every patent case as it approaches trial.\" D.I. 56 at 8-9. However, \nthe Court and parties would waste effort by construing or hiring experts to analyze terms in claims \nthat the PT AB then invalidated. Ramot also argues that the PT AB has not instituted an IPR as to \nthe '998 patent, and this case shares a scheduling order with the case that concerns the '998 patent, \nNo. 22-674. D.I. 56 at 7. However , C.A. Nos. 21-1365 and 22-674 remain separate, and Plaintiffs \nseek a stay only of C.A. No. 21-1365. \nThe second stay factor-the status of the litigation-also favors a stay. The case is in its \nearly stages. Fact discovery does not close until September 29, 2023, expert discovery closes on \nFebruary 9, 2024, and trial is scheduled to begin September 16, 2024. See D.I. 59 ,r,r 4(a), 4(t)(iv), \n21. Ramot argues that \"the executed Scheduling Order places no substantive work by the Court, \nand only ordinary discovery and claim construction briefing by the parties, between today and the \nconclusion of the '872 Patent IPRs.\" D.I. 56 at 10. Further, Ramot explains that \"[t]he parties \nhave already agreed to reuse all of the document production\" from a prior case here and, thus, \n\"tens of thousands of documents have already been effectively ( or literally) produced here.\" Id. \nPlaintiffs respond that the prior discovery failed to cover both \"additional products\" now at issue \nand developments in the intervening period. D .I. 61 at 8. The Court finds that the limited resources \nspent to date in this case favor a stay, even if the parties will reuse materials from prior cases. \n3 However, the third stay factor-the risk of undue prejudice to Ramot-disfavors a stay. \nFirst, \"the court recognizes that [Ramot] is prejudiced by having its day in court delayed further.\" \nTextron Innovations Inc. v. Toro Co., 2007 WL 7772169, at *3 (D. Del. Apr. 25, 2007). Second, \nrather than wait for Ramot to sue for infringement , Plaintiffs filed this case \"to remove the cloud \nof infringement allegations placed over their optical-transceiver-module-related products by the \n'872 patent.\" D.I. 1 ,r 7. When Ramot asked the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act and proceed only on Ramot' s counterclaims, Plaintiffs resisted and \nagain insisted that this Court hear their case. D.I. 28 at 6. Third, Plaintiffs elected to raise non\u00ad\ninfringement and inequitable conduct claims that the IPR process cannot resolve. D.I. 1 ,r,r 51-52; \nD .I. 11 at 21-31. Plaintiffs also provide little reason that the PT AB' s ruling in the instituted IPRs \nwould affect fact discovery in this case. See D.I. 61 at 7-8 (discussing likelihood of \"motion \npractice\" arising from discovery). While the PTAB may invalidate all asserted claims of the '872 \npatent, D.I. 61 at 6, both this Court and the PTAB must presume the '872 patent is valid, see 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 282(a).1 This Court granted a declaratory judgment plaintiff's stay request inIOENGINE , \nLLC v. Pay Pal Holdings, Inc., but that case is distinguishable because the declaratory judgment \nplaintiff there was \"a potential indemnitor\" of a defendant against whom the patentee had already \nfiled suit. 2020 WL 419448, at *1, *7 (D. Del. Jan. 27, 2020). Here, Plaintiffs filed first and asked \nto litigate in this Court. See D.I. 28 at 1 (invoking the first-filer rule). \nThe risks that the Court will construe and that the parties will enlist experts to analyze \nclaims that the PT AB then invalidates favor a stay. However, the risk of prejudice to Ramot \ndisfavors a stay. The Court agrees with Ramot that permitting fact discovery to move forward \n1 While not directly applicable here, the Court found in a companion case that \"[Plaintiffs] abused \nthe Declaratory Judgment Act by running to the courthouse at 12:01 a.m. on the day that Ramot's \npatent was released.\" D.I. 51 at 10. \n4 would help reduce prejudice from \"evidence going stale,\" D.I. 56 at 11, while it would limit the \nunnecessary use of the Court's resources. Thus, on balance, the Court denies the stay as to fact \ndiscovery-paragraphs 1, 2, 3(a), 3(b), 4(a) and 4(b) of the Court's Scheduling Order, D.I. 59-\nand grants the stay as to all other dates in the Scheduling Order in C.A No. 21-1365. \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court grants-in-part and denies-in-part the stay. \nTherefore, at Wilmington this 19th day of January, 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED \nthat Cisco's and Acacia's Motion to Stay C.A. No. 21-1365 Pending Inter Partes Review (\"IPR\") \n(the \"Motion,\" D.I. 52) is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART: \n1. The Motion is DENIED as to the dates contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3(a), 3(b), 4(a) and \n4(b) of the Court's Scheduling Order in C.A. 21-1365, D.I. 59; \n2. The Motion is GRANTED as to all other dates contained in said Scheduling Order; and \n3. The parties shall jointly file a status report and proposed amended scheduling order for all \nstayed deadlines within seven (7) days of the PT AB' s final determination in the IPRs. \n5 GREGORY B.
