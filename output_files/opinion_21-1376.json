{"case_name": "Design with Friends, Inc. et al v. Target Corporation", "case_number": "21-1376", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "09-23-2022", "ocr_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nDESIGN WITH FRIENDS, INC.; \nDESIGN WITH FRIENDS LTD.  \n Plaintiffs , \n v. \n \nTARGET\n CORPORATION  \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:21 -cv-01376-SB \n \n \n \nDouglas Daniel Herrmann, T ROUTMAN PEPPER HAMILTON SANDERS LLP, \nWilmington, DE; Ben L. Wagner, TROUTMAN PEPPER HAMILTON SANDERS LLP, \nSan Diego, CA; Lindsay Mitchell Henner, T ROUTMAN PEPPER HAMILTON SANDERS \nLLP, Atlanta, GA; Howard Wisnia, W ISNIA PC, San Diego, CA.  \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff s. \n \nMartina Tyreus Hufnal, F ISH & RICHARDSON P.C., Wilmington, DE; Kristen \nMcCallion, Vivian Cheng, F ISH & RICHARDSON P.C., New York, NY.  \n \nCounsel for Defendant . \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \nSeptember 23 , 2022  \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judge , sitting by designation.  \nA company may feel cheated  if a competitor  copies its product. But copying by \nitself can be legal. T o win in court , the company must show that a law protects its  \nproduct from copying . \nDesign with Friends alleges that Target copied its software tool. Because  much  of \nthat tool is not protected , I dismiss most of its claims. The only claim that survives is \nthat Target copied its copyrighted computer code . \nI. BACKGROUND  \nOn this motion to dismiss, I take the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true. \nDesign with Friends has an online room- planning tool. Users can add furniture and \ndecorations, arrange them, and then buy  the items they have added. The tool is meant \nto be user -friendly and has been commercially successful . 1st Am. Compl., D.I. 12 \n\u00b6\u00b6 10\u201324. \nTarget has a similar  online room -planning tool. This similarity, says Design with \nFriends, is no coincidence \u2014it claims that Target\u2019s engineers spent many hours \nreverse  engine ering the Design with Friends tool to build their own.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 33\u201337, 55 \u2013\n61. \nDesign with Friends demanded that Target stop this copying , but it did not . Id. \n\u00b6 73. So it sue d Target  on three theories: trade- dress infringement, copyright \ninfringement, and breach of contract.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 75\u2013106. Target now moves to dismiss.  \nI consider whether Design with Friends\u2019 \u201ccomplaint \u2026 contain[s] sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to state a [plausible] claim to relief.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  3 II. THE TRADE -DRESS CLAIM FAILS \nDesign with Friends  first claims that Target infringed its protected trade dress. \nTo win, it  must articulate the specific design elements that comprise that trade dress. \nFair Wind Sailing, Inc. v. Dempster, 764 F.3d 303, 309 (3d Cir. 2014). It also must \nshow that (1) the design is nonfunctional , (2) the design is inherently distinctive or \nhas acquired secondary meaning , and (3)  consumers are likely to confuse the source \nof its tool with the source of Target\u2019s. Id.  Although Design with Friends has specified \nits trade dress and alleged (2) secondary meaning, it fails to show  that (1) its dress is \nnonfunctional and (3) consumers will likely be confused . \nTo describe its trade dress, Design with Friends has listed fifteen elements that \ntogether form its tool\u2019s  cohesive \u201clook and feel.\u201d  D.I. 12 \u00b6 96. Target says that this list \nis not precise  enough  because Design with Friends has alleged that its trade -dress  \ncomponents \u201ceither are, or include but are not limited to ,\u201d the listed elements.  Id.; \nPls.\u2019 Br., D.I. 16 at 5.  But Design with Friends has provided a clear list of design \nfeatures that it is trying to protect . So it is precise  enough. \nDesign with Friends  must also show that its design has acquired secondary \nmeanin g: that it is independently recognizable and associated with the company.  \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc. , 529 U.S. 205, 211, 216 (2000).  As proof, \nDesign with Friends points out that  its tool has been used extensively, advertised  \nwidely , and praised in industry publications. D.I. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 17\u201321. This suffices to allege \nsecondary meaning. Target objects that this shows only that the tool  is well -known, \nnot that the trade dress is. D.I. 16 at 8 \u20139. But because Design with Friends alleges 4 that its trade dress is the overall look and feel of the tool, the tool\u2019s recognition is the \ndress\u2019s.  \nStill, precision  and secondary meaning  are not enough. Design with Friends must \nalso show that its  design is not functional. Functional means useful : a design feature \nis nonfunctional only if it does not affect the tool\u2019s quality and serves only  to identify \nits source . Ezaki Glico Kabushiki Kaisha v. Lotte Int\u2019l Am. Corp. , 986 F.3d 250, 255\u2013\n58 (3d Cir.  2021) ; Fair Wind , 764 F.3d at 311. Most of the elements on Design with \nFriends\u2019 list are functional  because  they make the tool more sensible . For instance,  \nmaking the walls facing the camera invisible lets users see the room . Putting  the \noption to rotate beneath an item makes th at option quicker to find . And automatically \nadding sheets to cribs makes the design more realistic . D.I. 12 \u00b6 96. The other \nelements do not  help identify the tool\u2019s source . For example, it  is common to see  \nrotating loading icons online . Design with Friends has not explained how the way s \nthat items slide along walls and move over one  another are  distinctive and identify \nthe brand , either.  Id. \nBut wait, says Design with Friends. I should focus not on the listed items one by \none, but rather on the \u201clook and feel\u201d they form as a whole.  Def.\u2019s Resp. Br., D.I. 17 \nat 4\u20136. But Design with Friends must still show that this overall look and feel is \nnonfunctional. Fair Wind , 764 F.3d at 3 10\u201311. Here, too, it has  not. The whole, like \nits parts, is functional. It is not a \u201ccomposite tapestry of visual effects\u201d that serves \nmerely to identify the tool\u2019s source. Id. at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted) ; see \nEzaki Glico , 986 F.3d at 259\u2013 60 (holding that a cookie  stick \u2019s overall design is useful 5 and therefore not  protectable  trade dress).  The tool\u2019s overall design makes it easy to \nuse. Design with Friends says as much. S ee D.I. 12 \u00b6 3 (explaining that the tool is \ndesigned to be \u201cconsumer -friendly [and] instantly -usable\u201d).  \nI could stop there. For completeness , I note that Design with Friends has also \nfailed to  show that consumers are likely to be confused about the sources  of its tool \nand Target\u2019s. Design with Friends alleges \u201cactual confusion\u201d but gives no example . \nId. \u00b6 97. Its allegation of likely confusion similarly falls short \u2014Design with Friends \nhas not explained why consumers would be confused about the sources of tools that \nare accessed through different websites, sell different merchandise, and have \ndifferent graphics . See id. \nBecause Design with Friends \u2019 design is functional and not likely to confuse \nconsumers, it is not protectable trade dress. So I  dismiss th is claim.  \nIII. ONE COPYRIGHT -INFRINGEMENT  CLAIM SURVIVES  \nTo prove copyright infringement, Design with Friends must  plausibly allege that \nTarget copied protectable elements of its work.  Whelan Assocs. , Inc. v. Jaslow Dental \nLab\u2019y, Inc. , 797 F.2d 1222, 1231 (3d Cir. 1986) . In copyright as in trade dress, a \nprotectable element must be original and nonfunctional. 17 U.S.C . \u00a7 102. That applies \nto foreign works too.  Id. \u00a7 104(b), (c) (granting the same scope of copyright protection \nto domestic and foreign works) ; cf. D.I. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 5 , 32 (Design with Friends Ltd. is an \nIsraeli company) . So its claim that Target copied  its tool\u2019s function , look and feel,  and \n\u201cselection, arrangement and coordination \u201d of visual elements  fails for the reasons \nabove. Id. \u00b6 76. 6 Design with Friends also holds  copyrights  in its tool\u2019s graphics  and code . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25\u2013\n29; Exs. A\u2013D , D.I. 12 -1 to -4.  It argues that Target copied these graphics.  Yet its own \nside-by-side pictures show that its tool and Target\u2019s are visually distinct.  D.I. 12 \n\u00b6\u00b6 38\u201353. See, e.g., D.I. 12  \u00b6\u00b6 43\u201344 (Design with Friends\u2019 paints selected from \ncolumns, but Target\u2019s paints selected from a grid; sheets designed and presented \ndifferently). This \u201cvisual comparison of the works\u201d is appropriate at the motion -to-\ndismiss stage.  Tanksley v. Daniels, 902 F.3d 165, 172 (3d Cir. 2018) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) So this claim fa ils too. \nBut Design with Friends has plausibly alleged c opying  of its computer code . \nCopyright infringement can be proven by access and similarity. Id.  at 173. Design \nwith Friends recorded Target repeatedly using  its software -development applications \nto access and stress -test Design with Friends\u2019 tool. D.I. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 55\u201361. And Design with \nFriends alleges extensive similarities in the tools \u2019 mechanics . Although these \nmechanics are functional, even such non- protectable elements can still be compared \nfor evidence of actual copying.  See Tanksley , 902 F.3d at 173.  \nTarget wants us to discount this circumstantial evidence.  It says that  Design with \nFriends should have just gone to Target \u2019s website , viewed the tool\u2019s source code, and \ncompared it to Design with Friends \u2019 own  code. Reply  Br., D.I. 18 at 9, n.25.  But Target \nadmits that only \u201c at least some \u201d of the  tool\u2019s code is available this way . Id. at 9. And \nit has not shown that the relevant  portions of the code are so easily accessible.  \nSo Design with Friends has done enough . I will let  its copyright -infringement \nclaim go forward on a theory of code copying.  7 IV. THE BREACH -OF-CONTRACT  CLAIM ALSO FAILS \nDesign with Friends has browsewrap terms of use that bar copying or reverse  \nengineering its tool. D.I. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 64\u201371; Ex. E, D.I. 12 -5. It says that Target knew or \nshould have known about these terms when its employees used the website. D.I. 12 \n\u00b6\u00b6 64\u201371. Thus, argues Design with Friends, Target  formed a contract not to copy the \ntool and then breached that contract.  \nTarget objects that this  copying claim is preempted by copyright law.  D.I. 16 at \n18\u201319. But I need not reach that question. Even if  the claim is not preempted, Design \nwith Friends has not plausibly alleged that it formed a contract with Target . \nDesign with Friends offers two theories of  contract formation. Both fail. First, it \nalleges that Target employees clicked through the browsewrap link and viewed the terms of use. D.I. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 64\u201372. But it offers no specific facts to support this. \nElsewhere, by contrast, Design with Friends l ists particular instances when Target \nemployees were recorded using its tool. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 55\u201361. The bare assertion that Target  \nemployees saw the terms, without similarly specific support, does not meet the \nplausibility threshold. Nor can we infer that Target e mployees knew that the terms \nwere there: Design with Friends has not alleged that the link to its terms was conspicuous enough to satisfy the high standard for browsewrap terms . See Nguyen \nv. Barnes & Noble Inc. , 763 F.3d 1171, 1175 \u201379 (9th Cir. 2014).  \nSecond, Design with Friends argues that Target employees had  constructive \nnotice of the website\u2019s terms  of use . After all, they are tech -savvy and work for a \ncompany with its own website  and its own terms of use. D.I. 12 \u00b6 69. But it is common \nknowledge that websites have terms of use. That does not mean a person manifests 8 assent to be bound by them every time he uses a website. 1 Timothy Murray, Corbin \non Contracts  \u00a7 2.12[2] (2022) (\u201cUnless the [user] actually knows or is put on inquiry \nnotice of the hyper link and manifests assent to the terms of use \u2026  they are \nunenforceable.\u201d). \n* * * * * \nTarget might have copied Design with Friends\u2019 tool. But copying alone is not a \nproblem. Design with Friends has not plausibly allege d that Target copied \nprotectable aspects of its tool . Nor has it plausibly alleged that Target contractually \nagreed not to copy the tool . Yet it has stated a plausible claim that Target copied its \ncomputer code. So the case can proceed on that claim  alone . And I will grant Design \nwith Friends leave to amend.  "}
