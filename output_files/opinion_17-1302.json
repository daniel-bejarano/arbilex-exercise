BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Backgrou nd\nPlaintiff is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Olean, New \nYork.  (D.I. 23 at \u00b6 2)  Defendant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Mateo, California.  ( Id. at \u00b6 3)  At the time of the filing of this case, both parties sold \ndevices ( sometimes referred to herein as \u201c video rigs \u201d or \u201crigs\u201d ) that hold cameras meant to \ncapture full 360 degree spherical images .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 21) 2 At issue in the case is Plaintiff\u2019s Uni ted States Patent No. 9,152,019 (the \u201c '019 patent\u201d).  \nThe '019 patent, entitled \u201c360 Degree Camera Mount and Related Photographic and Video \nSystem,\u201d relates to systems and methods for releasably retaining a plurality of cameras in predetermined orientations, to allow for capturing of 360 degree composite images or 360 degree by 180 degree full spherical images.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; see also  D.I. 1, ex. 1)\n1  Michael Kintner, \nPlaintiff\u2019s founder and Chief Executive Officer, is the named inventor on the patent.  (D.I. 23 at \u00b6 16; '019 patent at 1)   \nIn 2013, Plain tiff began marketing and selling its own video rigs that are alleged to read \non the claims of the '019 patent .  (D.I. 224, ex. 1)  In 2016, Plaintiff re-branded its rigs as \u201c360 \nRIZE. \u201d  (D.I. 226, ex. 53 at \u00b6 10)  \nIn this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant\u2019s Omni device, Abyss device and Odyssey \ndevice ( together, the \u201caccused products,\u201d the \u201caccused rigs\u201d or the \u201caccused video rigs\u201d)\u2014\ndevices that hold configurations of a number of cameras in particular orientations to capture full spherical/360 degree video images\u2014infringe the '019 patent.  (D.I. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6  22-32)  The Omni rig  \nis depicted below: \n1T he patent -in-suit was attached as Exhibit 1 to the original Complaint in the case.  \nFurther citations will simply be to the \u201c '019 patent.\u201d 3 (Id. \nat \u00b6 22)  The Abyss rig  is depicted below: \n(Id.\n at \u00b6 25)  And the Odyssey rig  is depicted below:  \n4 (Id.\n at \u00b6 28)  \nDefendant began offering the Omni rig for sale in April 2016, first began shipping the \nproduct in August 2016 and discontinued sales in 2017.  (D.I. 225, ex. 23 at \u00b6 23; id ., ex. 25; id ., \nex. 29; id ., ex. 30 at ex. A at 24)  It began selling the Abyss rig in April 2015 and discontinued \nsales in 2017.  ( Id., ex. 30 at ex. A at 25, 27; D.I. 226, ex. 31)  And it began selling  the Odyssey \nrig in September 2015, first began shipping it in May 2016 and discontinued production of the \nrig as of 2017.  (D.I. 225, ex. 18 at 79-80; id ., ex. 19; id ., ex. 22; id ., ex. 23 at \u00b6 22, ex. 30 at ex. \nA at 24 )   \nThe '019 patent includes 37 claims, with claims 1, 15, 22 and 30 being independent \nclaims.  ('019 patent)  Claim s 15-21 are method claims and every other claim in the patent is an \napparatus claim.  ( Id.)  The four independent claims r ead as follows : \n1.A holding assembly configured to releasably retain a\nplurality of photographic cameras in a predetermined\norientation, said holding assembly comprising:\na\n support including a support body having a plurality of \nsupport arms extending outwardly and radially f rom the \nsupport body; and  \n5 e\nach of the support arms including a receptacle disposed \nthereon and in which a plurality of the receptacles are disposed \nradially about the exterior of said support body, each of said receptacles defining an open -ended enclosur e having at least \none latching feature for enabling a photographic camera to be releasably retained within the defined enclosure wherein the receptacles are oriented about said support such that each \nretained camera provides an overlapping field of view, t he \ncameras being disposed on the support to create either a 360 degree by 180 degree full spherical composite image or a 360 degree composite image.  \n15.A\n method for manufacture of a holding assembly that\nenables capture of 360 degree photographic or video images ofa scene of interest, said method comprising:\npr\noviding a support for said holding assembly comprising a \ncenter support body having a plurality of outwardly extending support arms, including a corresponding plurality of receptacles arranged on each extending support arm, each said receptacle defining an open -ended enclosure that is sized for \nreleasably receiving at least one photographic camera body and in which each said receptacle is disposed in a specific angular or spherical orientation relative to each other to enable a 360 degree by 180 degree full spherical composite image or a 360 degree composite image to be created by the retained photographic cameras; and  \nco\nnfiguring each receptacle with a latching feature to enable a \nphotographic camera body to be releasably secured within the support without requiring tools. \n22\n. A system for creating 360 degree images of a scene of\ninterest, the system comprising:\na\n holding assembly configured to releasably retain a plurality \nof cameras in a predetermined orientation, the holding assembly comprising;  \na\n supporting frame defined by a center support and a plurality \nof support arms outwardly extending from the center support;  \na\n plurality of receptacles disposed about the exterior of the \nsupporting frame, each of said receptacles provided on a 6 corresponding support arm and defining a receiving cavity \nsized to accommodate a camera and including a latching feature for releasably and individually retaining a photographic camera within the receptacle and wherein the receptacles are oriented about said supporti ng frame such that each camera, \nwhen loaded into the receptacles provides an overlapping field of view, the cameras being disposed to create a 360 degree by 180 degree full spherical composite image or a 360 degree composite image . \n30. A\n holding fixture configured to retain a plurality of\nphotographic cameras in a predetermined orientation, theholding fixture comprising:\na\n support including a center support body and a plurality of \nsupport arms outwardly and radially extending from the support body; and  \na\n plurality of receptacles disposed about the exterior of the \nsupport and at the extending ends of each support arm, each of the receptacles defining an open end enclosure sized for retaining a photographic camera and in which the receptacles are oriented about the support such that each retained photographic camera provides an overlapping field of view, the cameras being disposed such that a centerline of the lens barrel of each retained camera is configured to intersect at a common center apex to enable either a 360 degree by 180 degree full spherical composite image or a 360 degree composite image to be created.  \n(\n'019 patent, col. 22:24-41; id ., col. 23:15-32; id ., cols. 23:50-24:4; id., col. 24:23-40) \nIn this litigation, it appears that Plaintiff is still asserting  claims 1 -5, 8, 11-12, 15-16, 18-\n20, 22-25 and 30-37.  (D.I. 237, ex. F at 4)  It asserts that Defendant began infringing the patent \non October 6, 2015.  (D.I. 226, ex. 53 at ex. A  at \u00b6 61)   \nFurther additional relevant facts will be referenced as needed in Section II.  \nB. Procedural Background7 Plaintiff commenced th is action on September 13, 2017.  (D.I. 1)2  The Court was \nthereafter referred the case to hear and resolve all pre-trial matters, up to and including the \nresolution of case dispositive motions, by Judge Leonard P. Stark, who was the United States District Judge  then assigned to the case.  (D.I. 5)\n3   \nThe Motion was filed on August 6, 2021, (D.I. 217), and it was fully briefed as of \nSeptember 15 , 2021, (D.I. 242).   The Court held oral argument on the Motion and other-since-\nresolved related motions on September 29, 2021.  (D.I. 256, hereinafter \u201cTr.\u201d)    \nII. DISCUSSIONA. GoPro\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment\nT\nhe Court first addresses the portion of the Motion that seeks summary judgment of non-\ninfringement ( referred to herein  as the \u201cMSJ\u201d) .  Below, the Court will first set out the relevant \nlegal standards  for this inquiry.  Therea fter, it will address each of the summary judgment issues \nraised by Defendant.     \n1. Legal Standards\na. Summary Judgment\n2In April 2016, Defendant  f iled a trademark and copyright infringement suit \nagainst Plaintiff  in the Unit ed States District Court for the Northern District of California (the \n\u201cCalifornia Court\u201d).  (D.I. 226, ex. 35 at 1)  Plaintiff later filed a counterclaim for patent \ninfringement of the '019 patent in that action .  (Id.)  The California Court eventually ruled that \nPlaintiff did not then have standing to sue under the '019 patent and dismissed the infringement claim from the suit.  (D.I. 223 at 1)  Plaintiff later re -filed its patent infringement allegations as \nto the '019 patent (with some alterations) against Defendant in the instant case.  \n3T he case has recently been reassigned to visiting United States District Judge \nMatthew F. Kennelly of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  (Docket Entry, Feb. 1, 2022)  8  A grant of summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585 n.10 (1986).  If the moving party meets this burden, the nonmovant must then \u201ccome forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial .\u201d  Id.  at 587 (emphasis \nin original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  If the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 \nU.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  During this process, the Court will \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).   \nHowever, in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \n\u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586.  The \u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine  issue of material  fact.\u201d  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986) (emphasis in original).  Facts that could alter the outcome are \u201cmaterial,\u201d and a factual dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only where \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d  Id.  at 248.  \u201cIf the evidence is merely \ncolorable . . . or is not significantly probative . . . summary judgment may be granted.\u201d  Id . at \n249-50 (internal citations omitted).9 A party asserting that a fact cannot be\u2014or, alternatively, is \u2014genuinely disputed must \nsupport the assertion either by citing to \u201cparticular parts of materials in the record, including \ndepositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or \nother materials\u201d; or by \u201cshowing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).    \nb. Patent Infringement\nThe patent infringement analysis consists of two steps.  Markman v. Westview \nInstruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  First, the court must determine the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.  Id.   Claim construction is generally a \nquestion of law, although subsidiary fact finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, 326 (2015).  Second, the trier of fact must compare the properly construed claims to the allegedly infringing device.  Markman, 52 F.3d at 976.  This second step presents  a question of fact.  ActiveVideo Networks, Inc. v. Verizon Commc\u2019ns, Inc., \n694 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2012). \n\u201cLiteral infringement of a claim exists when every limitation recited in the claim is found \nin the accused device.\u201d  Kahn v. Gen. Motors Corp., 135 F.3d 1472, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  If \nany claim limitation is absent from the accused product, there is no literal infringement as a matter of law.  Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffman\u2013La Roche Ltd, 580 F.3d 1340, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  A product that does not literally infringe a patent claim may still infringe under the doctrine of equivalents if the differences between the claimed invention and the accused product are insubstantial, or if the accused product or method performs substantially the same function in 10 substantially the same way with substantially the same result as each claim limitation of the \npatented product or method (i.e., the \u201cfunction, way, result test\u201d).  See Virnetx, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 767 F.3d 1308, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ; AquaTex Indus., Inc. v. Techniche Sols ., 479 F.3d \n1320, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2007). \nThe patent owner has the burden of proving infringement, and must do so by a \npreponderance of the evidence .  SmithKline Diagnostics, Inc. v. Helena Labs. Corp., 859 F.2d \n878, 889 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  When an accused infr inger moves for summary judgment of non-\ninfringement, such relief is only appropriate if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the patentee, no reasonable jury could find that every limitation recited in the properly construed claim is found in  the accused device, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.  See \nChimie v. PPG Indus., Inc., 402 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2005); see also Bell Atl. Network Servs., Inc. v. Covad Commc\u2019ns Grp., Inc., 262 F.3d 1258, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \n2. D iscussion\nDefendant argues that summary judgment should be granted on four different grounds.  \nThe Court will address each ground in turn below. \na. \u201cSupport Arms \u201d Limitation\nAll of the asserted claims of the '019 patent  require a plurality of \u201csupport arms\u201d that :  (1) \neach extend outward from a support body/center support body/center support (collectively, a  \n\u201csupport body\u201d ) and (2) are each  in some way associated with a receptacle.  (D.I. 223 at 13)  The \nCalifornia Court construed \u201csupport\u201d to mean \u201cstructure that holds or positions something\u201d and construed \u201csupport arm(s)\u201d according to its plain and ordinary meaning.  (D.I. 226, ex. 35 at 7)\n4   \n4The California Court construed certain of the patent\u2019s claim terms during the \np\narties\u2019 litigation in that Court ; the parties thereafter agreed to adopt those constructions in this 11 Defendant \u2019s first MSJ argument is that none of the a ccused products\u2014the Omni rig, the \nAbyss rig or the Odyssey rig\u2014contain \u201csupport arms.\u201d  The Court will address this issue on a \nrig-by-rig basis. \ni. The Omni Rig\nWith regard to the Omni rig, Plaintiff\u2019s allegation is that certain \u201cprotrusions\u201d on the \ninner cube of the device amount to \u201csupport arms.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 14)  These protrusions are depicted in yellow in  the following picture of a portion of the Omni rig; the picture  was prepared  \nby Plaintiff\u2019s technical expert, Dr. Randall King : \n (\nD.I. 223 at 14; D.I. 226, ex. 37 at 10)  Defendant makes two different arguments as to why \nsummary judgment should be granted. \nFirst, Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted because the inner cube of \nthe Omni rig (which Dr. King colored in blue in the above picture) is in fact a single piece of  \nblack  plastic, and that the protrusions on the inner cube cannot be \u201csupport arms\u201d  because they \nare \u201csimply part of the inner cube itself.\u201d   (D.I. 223 at 14-15; D.I. 242 at 5; Defendant\u2019s Hearing \ncase.  (D.I. 223 at 12 & n.6)  The undersigned Judge also construed certain  of the claim s\u2019 terms \nin this case ; those constructions were later adopted by Judge Stark.  (D.I. 138; D.I. 139; D.I. 140; \nD.I. 144; D.I. 147; D.I. 148)\n12 Presentation, Slide 46; see also  D.I. 226, ex. 38 at 82)  In other words, Defendant is arguing that:  \n(1) pursuant to the claims, the \u201csupport arms \u201d must be an identifiably distinct element of  the\nclaimed rig ; but (2) the protrusions are not that, and instead are simply the same thing as (i.e., \nthey constitute the outer surface of) th e very  structure that is said to amount to the support body.  \n(D.I. 223 at 14-15; D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A at  \u00b6 45.b.; Tr. at 99-100; see also  D.I. 242 at 5 \n(Defendant arguing that the \u201cyellow- and blue-colored parts of the device [in Dr. King\u2019s \ndepiction shown on the previous page] are actually part of the same unitary structures and are not, as 360Heros contends, distinct parts of a more complex system.\u201d) )   \nThe Court agrees that, pursuant to the claims\u2019 language, the \u201csupport arms\u201d must be an  \nidentifiably distinct element of the invention, vis-\u00e0-vis the support body.  ( See, e.g., '019 patent, \ncol. 22:27-28 (\u201ca support including a support body having a plurality of support arms  extending \noutwardly and radially from the support body \u201d) (emphasis added) ; id., col. 23:55- 57 (\u201ca \nsupporting frame defined by a center support and a plurality of support arms  outwardly \nextending from the center support \u201d) (emphasis added) )  But in  the Court\u2019s view, there is a \ngenuine dispute of material fact here as to whether that is so  here.   \nIn his expert reports, Dr. King opines that the \u201cOmni has separate  protrusions performing \na different function [from the inner cube, which is the asserted  support body]:  spacing the \nreceptacle away from the support body.\u201d  (D.I. 237, ex. H at 11 (\u201cKing Reply Report\u201d) (emphasis added) ; Tr. at 114-15 (Plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserting that the protrusions are \u201c\u2018separate \nstructures\u2019 \u201d and that this is  in part because they \u201ccome up from the side\u201d of the inner cube) )  It \nseems undisputed that the protrusions and the inner cube of the Omni are all part of a single \u201cunitary\u201d physical structure \u2014in the sense that they are manufactured as a \u201cunitary piece.\u201d  (Tr. \nat 100; see also  id. at 115)  But as the Court noted during the Motion hearing, this  fact is not 13 necessarily dispositive ; after all, certain figures in the patent depict a \u201csupport arm\u201d and a \nsupport body that could well have been constructed from one unitary piece of material.  ( Tr. at \n100 (Defendant\u2019s counsel agreeing that this understanding of what the patent depicts is \n\u201creasonable\u201d); see al so '019 patent , FIGS. 1a & 1b)  Plaintiff\u2019s position is that even if the \nprotrusions are part of the same \u201cunitary body\u201d as the rest of the inner cube, they could still amount to a \u201cseparate\u201d claimed element , so long as they are distinguishable from the support \nbody\u2014in th e sense that they perform a \u201cseparate function[]\u201d from the rest of the inner cube.  (Tr. \nat 115)  The Court agrees.  Even if the protrusions are made of the same piece of plastic as the \nrest of the inner cube, so long as the protrusions/\u201csupport arms\u201d and the inner cube/ support body \nare separately identifiable elements/ components (as they could be viewed to be here), then the \nCourt cannot say that infringement is precluded.  T he jury  should be able to view the accused rig , \nhear the respective experts describe that rig  and make this infringement call for itself .\n5   \n5R elatedly, Defendant also argues that during an inter partes  review (\u201cIPR\u201d) \nproceeding between the parties involving the '019 patent, Plaintiff made certain statements about \nanother reference (the \u201cGeerds\u201d reference ) wherein Plaintiff \u201cexpressly disclaimed the position it \nnow takes [as to why the protrusions in the Omni can amount to \u2018support arms.\u2019]\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 15) In the IPR, Plaintiff argued that certain components of the Geerds device could not amountto \u201csupport arms\u201d because those components were simply \u201carbitrary sections of the single[support] body in Geerds\u201d and not \u201cdistinct\u201d \u201csupport arms.\u201d  (D.I. 226, ex. 36 at 28-29)\nT\nhe Court certai nly understands why Defendant made this argument, a s the issue is not \nfree from doubt.  However, and even assuming that P laintiff\u2019s IPR statements could have binding \neffect, ( see D.I. 234 at 24; Tr. at 103-05), the Court ultimately concludes that summary judgment \nis not warranted on this basis.  Defendant\u2019s disclaimer argument presumes that the structure at issue in Geerds is just like the structure at issue in the Omni.  Yet in his expert reports, Dr. King has asserted that there are material differences between those two structures ; he claims that \nunlike in Geerds, the Omni\u2019s protrusions do not amount to \u201carbitrary sections of\u201d the single support body therein.  (King Reply Report at 11)  Dr. King  explains that while \u201ct he [Geerds] \nplatform is a single part  performing a single purpose :  providing a platform base to attach the \nremaining scaffolding[,]\u201d the Omni  rig, in contrast, \u201c has separate  protrusions performing a \ndifferent function :  spacing the receptacle away from th e support body.\u201d ( Id.) (emphasis added) )  \nThe Court cannot say that Dr. King\u2019s take on the se differences is wrong.  In the end, Plaintiff\u2019s 14 Second, Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted here as to those claims \n(claims 1, 30 and their dependents) that require the rig to have \u201csupport arms\u201d extending \n\u201coutwardly and radially \u201d from the support body.  (D.I. 223 at 18-20; D.I. 242 at 4-5 & n.3; see \nalso Tr. at 89-90)  The Court construed \u201cextending outwardly and radially\u201d as meaning \u201cextending outwardly from the center .\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 12 (emphasis added) )  The dispute here is \nover whether the alleged \u201csupport arms\u201d on the Omni can be said to extend \u201cfrom the center\u201d of the support body.  Defendant  argues that in his reports, Dr. King \u201cignored\u201d the Court\u2019s  \nconstruction \u201centirely\u201d and provided no explanation for how the protrusions extend \u201cfrom the center\u201d of the inner cube.  (D.I. 223 at 19-20) \nWhen construing the \u201coutwardly and radially\u201d term during claim construction, the Court \nprovided some further guidance that is relevant to this  infringement dispute.  For example, the \nCourt pointed to the \u201csupport arms\u201d (516) in Figure 5c, which is depicted in the patent as follows: \nassertions  in the IPR about Geerds\u2014a piece of prior art that disclosed a different device from the \nOmni , and that had different features than the Omni \u2014does not amount to a \u201cclear and \nunmistakeable \u201d disclaimer of claim scope.  Aylus Networks, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 856 F.3d 1353, \n1361 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) .   15 ('019 pa\ntent, FIG. 5c ( cited in  D.I. 138 at 7))  The Court explained that the patent made clear that \nthese \u201csupport arms\u201d did emanate from the \u201c center \u201d of the support body, even though:  (1) the \narms may not have extended out from the centroid ( i.e., the arithmetic mean position of all of the \npoints in the figure) of th e body; an d (2) the centerlines of the various support arms depicted in \nFigure 5 did not meet at a precise common center apex .  (D.I. 138 at 7; see also  D.I. 226, ex. 38 \nat 49 (Dr. King noting that the \u201ccenter\u201d of the support body need not be a \u201cprecise mathematical \npoint\u201d); D.I. 242 at 5 (Defendant acknowledging that the \u201ccenter\u201d need not be \u201ca precise centroid\u201d) )  On the other hand, the Court explained that there must actually be limits to what is \n(and what is not) the \u201ccenter\u201d of a support body.  To that point, the Court referenced a figure that Plaintiff had provided: \n16  (\nD.I. 138 at 10)  The Court noted that in this  figure, the \u201csupport arms\u201d were arranged such that \nthey did not extend radially from the red, circular support body; instead they extended from the \nvery outer edges of that support body.  ( Id.; see also  Tr. at 112 (the Court and Plaintiff\u2019s counsel \nnoting that this example \u201cwould not qualify\u201d as extending from the center of a support body, because the \u201csupport arms were . . . like off of [the support body]\u201d or \u201cextending along each side of that\u201d body)) \nWith this background in mind, the Court turns back to the instant dispute .  The issue \npresents a close call.  Plaintiff did not help itself  much , in that it presented a somewhat limited \nrecord in support of its argument.  For example, i n his Opening Report on infringement, Dr. King \nprovides little  information about why  the \u201csupport arms\u201d at issue extend radially from the support \nbody.  (D.I. 237, ex. F (\u201cKing Opening Report\u201d) at 10, 50-51)  Then in his Reply Report on infringement, Dr. King seems to muddy the waters a bit, as he argues that the protrusions (i.e., the alleged \u201csupport arms\u201d) on the Omni can meet the \u201cradially\u201d extending requirement even \nthough they are \u201coffset from the center\u201d of the support body.  (King Reply Report at 10-11)  This is confusing, because it begs the question:  \u201cDoes something that is \u2018 offset from the center \u2019 of a \nsupport body still extend \u2018 from the center \u2019 of that body?\u201d  Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s briefing on this \n17 issue , (D.I. 234 at 3-8), and its discussion with the Court during the Motion hearing, (Tr. at 109-\n13), was not particularly elucidating. \nBut in the end, the Court concludes that there is just enough here for a reasonable juror to \nfind for Plaintiff , and thus to warrant denial of this portion of the MSJ.  When one examines the \npictures of the Omni closely, it appears that certain portions of th e protrusions extend out from a \npart of the cube\u2019s face that \u2014even though it is not in the exact centroid of the cube\u2014nevertheless \nalso seems fairly far removed from the very outer edges of the cube.  ( See supra  p. 11)  Dr. King \nwill opine that a person of skill in the art (\u201cPOSITA\u201d) would recognize such \u201csupport arms\u201d as \nextending outward from the \u201cc enter \u201d of t hat cube\u2014in the sense that they emerge from the inner \nportion of the cube (and not, for example, from the outermost edges of the cube).  (D.I. 226, ex. 38 at 45-47 (Dr. King asserting that the center region of a device is identifiable and that support arms can extend from the center of a cube if they are found in the \u201cinside\u201d portion of a \u201ccube[,] \u201d \nas opposed to the \u201crightmost . . . part of the \u201d cube) ; see also  King Reply Report at 10-11) )  This \nis enough to demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact on this infringement question.  \nii. The Abyss Rig\nThe Court next turns to the Abyss rig.  Here, Plaintiff asserts that a portion of certain \ndomes that are attached to the Abyss\u2019 metal cube -shaped structure are the \u201csupport arms\u201d in \nquestion.  Below is a picture of one such dome: 18  (D.I. 234 at 12; see also  King Opening Report at 97-98 (asserting that these domes amount to \n\u201csupport arms\u201d because t hey project from a larger structure (i.e., the cube-shaped structure))   \nDefendant  notes that Plaintiff is really only asserting that the  rear portion of the dome  \n(i.e., the black portion t hat can be attached to the camera and that is screwed into the metal cube-\nshaped structure of the Abyss ) is what amounts to a \u201csupport arm.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 16; Tr. at 93)  \nAnd Defendant argues that this black portion of the dome cannot be said to extend \u201coutwardly\u201d \nfrom the support body, since \u201c[t]o the extent [the domes] extend in any direction, they do so in a \ncurving manner in an inward direction (parallel with the face of the cube frame).\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 16); see also  D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A  at \u00b6 54.a.  (Defendant\u2019s expert Dr. John D. Pratt asserting \nthat \u201c[t]o the extent that the domes can be said to \u2018extend\u2019 in any direction from the support body, their largest component of extension would be inward (parallel with the face of the cube frame) toward the center of the circular aperture.\u201d); Tr. at 92-93 (Defendant\u2019 s counsel arguing \nthat \u201cthe portion [of the dome] that actually holds the camera \u201d and that \u201cis in back \u201d is what is \n19 asserted to be the \u201csupport arm,\u201d and asserting that this cannot be a \u201csupport arm\u201d because it \n\u201cextends parallel to the . . . face of the outer cube\u201d))   \nTo be sure, the portion of the dome at issue here is very different looking than some of \nthe \u201csupport arms\u201d depicted in the patent.  And it may not look like what one typically thinks of \nas an \u201carm.\u201d  ( See D.I. 242 at 10 (\u201cThe Abyss is nothing like the disclosed or claimed \ninvention.\u201d) )  But the key question is simply whether this structure can meet the claims\u2019 \nrequirements for a \u201csupport arm.\u201d  On that score, Defendant\u2019s argument (which took up l ess than \na page of its opening brief) was not well-developed.  (D.I. 223 at 16- 17)  It was also not helped \nby the fact that the Court does not have the benefit (as the jury presumably would) of being able to see and hold the accused device in question.  From looking at pictures of this portion of the Abyss, it is not clear to the Court that the black portion of the dome extends  only inwardly (an d \ndoes not in any way extend outwardly ) from the cube-shaped structure.  Indeed, Dr. King says \nthe opposite:  he asserts that it is \u201cobvious\u201d that the \u201cdome structures . . . do in fact extend outwardly\u201d and he  notes that whether \u201cthe arms also extend inwardly\u201d is \u201c irrelevant  [as the] \nclaim language as construed does not exclude such a construction.\u201d  (King Reply Report at 15-16)   \nViewing the (relatively sparse) evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty, the Court finds that the images of  the Abyss, combined with Dr. King\u2019s expert opinion, are \ntogether sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to  this question.      \niii. The Odyssey Rig\nThe Court lastly turns to the Odyssey rig.  Here, Plaintiff argues that orange levers in the \nOdyssey, either alone or together with orange backpack pieces, are \u201csupport arms.\u201d  (D.I. 234 at 14-15)  The orange levers and orange backpack pieces are depicted below:20 (\nD.I. 234 at 15; see also  King Opening Report at 65-66 (asserting that these orange levers and \norange backpack pieces amount to \u201csupport arms\u201d because they project from a larger structure \n(i.e., the black frame or base plate of the Odyssey)) \nIn asserting that the Odyssey does not contain \u201csupport arms ,\u201d Defendant makes t wo \nmain arguments, which the Court will address in turn.  \nFirst, Defendant argues that the Odyssey cannot have \u201csupport arms\u201d because \u201ci[t] has a \nsingle, unitary base plate, a single cover lid with all of the 16 cameras entirely contained within the confines of those two parts [,]\u201d (D.I. 223 at 17 (citing D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A at \u00b6\u00b6 61 -62 & \nn.7)), and because Plaintiff\u2019s attempt \u201cto carve up the base plate and point to arbitrary sections asmeeting this limitation\u201d is \u201cdirectly contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s admission during IPR that a unitary structure cannot be arbitrarily divided into sections to meet these elements.\u201d   (Id. (citing  D.I. 226, \nex. 36 at 28-29, 37))  Here Defendant  is referring (again) to Plaintiff \u2019s comments in the IPR \nabout the Geerd s reference.  See supra n.5.  Yet as the Court has earlier explained, it does not \n21 view Plaintiff\u2019s statements about Geerds as a necessary barrier to its infringement position here.  \n(Id.)  Nor is it clear to the Court that the orange levers and orange backpacks at issue are , in fact,  \npart of one single, unitary structure.    \nSecond, Defendant argues that the levers or levers/backpack pieces  cannot constitute \n\u201csupport arms\u201d because they do not extend outwardly and radially from any support body (i.e. , \nfrom the black portion of the Odyssey frame /base plate).  Instead, Defendant asserts that the \nlevers/backpack pieces are \u201cdisposed on top of a portion of the support body\u201d and \u201c are contained \nentirely within the support body and within the outer wall of the [] rig\u2019s holding assembly.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 18 (citing  D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A  at \u00b6 61.a); D.I. 242 at 12; Tr. at 87-89)  Put differently, \nin Defendant\u2019s view, the lever/backpack pieces cannot extend \u201coutwardly\u201d from the support body because they are \u201cwithin the support body\u201d or \u201cinside the support body\u201d (in the sense that the outermost edge of the lever/backpack pieces do not extend beyond the outermost perimeter  of \nthe frame/base plate).  (Tr. at 88-89) \nAgain, the Court does not have the actual rig in question before it, so it can only assess \nthe accused device from pictures that the parties have supplied.  But in doing so, it seems that it \ncould be said that the levers /backpack pieces do extend \u201coutward ly\u201d from the frame/base plate\u2014\nat least in the sense that they are located on top of the frame/base plate and they extend upwards (i.e., towards the ceiling ) from that structure .  Of course, this  is not the kind of \u201coutward\u201d \nextension that is being depicted, for example, in Figure 5 of the patent (where the outward extension of the \u201csupport arms\u201d goes past the perimeter of the support body in the direction of the subject that is to be captured by the camera).  Yet the Court does not see why this  type of \n\u201ctoward the ceiling\u201d extension cannot be a form of \u201coutward\u201d extension.  (King Reply Report at 17 (\u201cThe claims are not limited as Dr. Pratt suggests to exclude structures where the position of 22 the support arms is inside the perimeter of the support body.\u201d); Tr. at 87 (the Court noting that \nthe asserted \u201csupport arm\u201d in question \u201cextends at the top\u201d and asking Defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cHow come extending outwardly can\u2019t mean extending outwardly atop the support body?\u201d))  Indeed, it seems as if it could . \niv. Conclusion\nIn sum, the Court recommends that Defendant\u2019s MSJ be DENIED  with regard to the \n\u201csupport arms\u201d limitation in its entirety.  \nb. \u201cReceptacles\u201d Limitation\nAll of the asserted claims of the '019 patent  require \u201creceptacles\u201d that are disposed on or \nabout, arranged on, or provided on a corresponding support arm.  (D.I. 223 at 20)  The claims also require that each \u201creceptacle\u201d must releasably retain or receive a camera.  ( Id.)  The \nCalifornia Court construed \u201c receptacle(s) \u201d to mean \u201cstructure(s) to receive and hold a camera in \nplace.\u201d  (D.I. 226, ex. 35 at 9-10)   \nIn its next set of MSJ arguments , Defendant  assert s that none of the a ccused products \ncontain \u201c receptacles .\u201d  Again, the Court will address these arguments on a rig-by-rig basis. \ni. The Omni Rig\nWith regard to the Omni rig , Plaintiff contends that the rig\u2019s HEROPorts \u2019 \u201cmale ends\u201d \nsatisfy this element, or that the HEROPorts, in conjunction with the \u201couter panel\u201d or \u201couter covers\u201d of the rig , meet this claim element.  The purported HEROPort \u201creceptacles\u201d are depicted \nbelow: 23 (\nD.I. 234 at 16)  \nIn pressing its MSJ on this issue, Defendant  first argues that a HEROPort cannot amount \nto a \u201creceptacle\u201d because it \u201cis like the end of a standard USB stick \u2014while it may be inserted \ninto a camera, it does not \u2018hold\u2019 a camera in place.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 21; Tr. at 96-97)  In furtherance \nof this argument, Defendant states that its expert, Dr. Pratt , \u201cshowed that a camera connected to \nthe Omni rig via only the HEROPort will droop, move, and ultimately, become disconnected \nwith very little movement of the rig.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 21 (citing  D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A  at \u00b6 46.c ))   \nBut there is also contrary evidence in the record .  In his Opening Report, Dr. King cites to \nphoto of the HEROPorts \u2019 \u201cmale ends [,]\u201d and notes that they \u201c fit inside the GoP ro Hero4 cameras \nsufficiently securely to prevent the cameras from detaching with normal activity[.]\u201d  (King Opening Report at 14- 15)  He also cites to a portion of the Omni\u2019s user manual that \u201cinstruct[s] \nusers to connect  a camera to the \u2018HEROBus connector\u2019 on the inner cube[;]\u201d this type of \n\u201cconnect [ion]\u201d sounds like a type of attachment that might suffice to hold a camera in place.  ( Id. \nat 15 (citing GP (360) 200000078) (emphasis added) )  Thus, with substantive evidence on both \nsides of the ledger, summary judgment is not warranted on this ground.  (Tr. at 96-97) \n24 Defendant \u2019s second argument is that the HEROPorts cannot be \u201c receptacles \u201d because \nthey are not located on the alleged support arms of the Omni, namely \u201c(a) the [protrusions on] \nthe outer surface of the center cube or (b) the metal rods that extend from that structure.\u201d   (D.I. 242 at 1; see also D.I. 223 at 21; Tr. at 96)  Because the HEROPorts \u201cbegin within  the inner cube \nand extend slightly through openings on the cube\u2019s outer surface[,]\u201d Defendant  asserts, they \ncannot be \u201cdisposed\u201d on/\u201cprovided\u201d on/\u201carranged\u201d on the support arms as is required by the claims.  (D.I. 223 at 21 (emphasis in original) (citing D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A  at \u00b6 4 6.b); see also  \n'019 patent, col. 22:30-31; id ., col. 23:21; id . col. 23:58; id ., col. 24:29; D.I. 138 at 14 (the Court \nconstruing \u201cdisposed thereon\u201d and \u201cdisposed on\u201d to mean \u201clocated thereon\u201d/ \u201clocated on\u201d ))  In \nthis regard, Dr. Pratt notes that \u201cthe [HEROPort] connectors are attached to a circuit board by a ribbon cable, [and so they] are mostly situated within the confines of the inner cube , and are \nreceived through openings in the outer surfaces of the inner cube[.]\u201d   (D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A  at \n\u00b6 46.b (emphasis added) )   \nPlaintiff, however, disagrees with Defendant\u2019s conclusion.  (D.I. 234 at 17)  In his \nOpening Report, Dr. King asserts that \u201c[a]t the end of each protrusion [i.e., a portion of the Omni that Plaintiff asserts can be a \u201csupport arm\u201d] is a \u2018HeroPort,\u2019 which receives and holds GoPro Hero4 cameras as shown  [in the photo included above on page 23].\u201d  (King Opening Report at \n14 (emphasis added) )  And in his Reply Report, Dr. King asserts that \u201cthe claims do not require \nthat every part of the receptacles / HeroPorts are attached to the support arms\u201d and that \u201c[n]othing in the claim language or specification suggests that the receptacle cannot be connected in part  to the support body\u201d; in light of this, he concludes that there is infringement, in \nthat t he HEROPorts \u201c extend through and are included in the support arms[.]\u201d  (King Reply \nReport at 11-12 (emphasis added) )   25 As to this dispute, there seems to be general agreement that  the Omni\u2019s HEROPorts (the \nalleged \u201creceptacles\u201d) touch  and extend through the protrusions (the alleged \u201csupport arms\u201d) \nfound on the Omni\u2019s inner cube (the alleged \u201csupport body\u201d)\u2014even though the HEROPorts are \nmostly situated within the confines of the inner cube.  Defendant\u2019s contention seems to be that if a component extends \u201cthrough\u201d a support arm, then it cannot be \u201cdisposed\u201d on/\u201cprovided\u201d on/\u201carranged\u201d on a support arm.  (D.I. 242 at 2-3)  But the Court does not agree that this is necessarily so .  In that scenario, a t least a  portion of the \u201creceptacle\u201d/HEROPort would be \nlocated on the \u201csupport arm\u201d/protrusion (in the sense that it is touching/affixed to/emanating from  the \u201csupport arm\u201d/protrusion).\n6  And it seems like a factfinder could reasonably conclude \nthat this meets the claims\u2019 \u201cdisposed\u201d on/\u201cprovided\u201d on/\u201carranged\u201d on claim requirements.7    \n6D efendan t may be suggesting that in order for a \u201creceptacle\u201d to be \u201cdisposed\u201d on \nor \u201cprovided\u201d on or \u201carranged\u201d on a support arm, the entirety  of the \u201creceptacle\u201d needs to be \nhoused on the outside or exterior of  the support arm.  (D.I. 242 at 2- 3 (Defendant assert ing that \n\u201c\u2018[t]hrough\u2019 however does not mean the same as \u2018on\u2019\u201d and that the \u201cclaim does not allow only a \n\u2018portion\u2019 or \u2018part\u2019 of a receptacle to be on the support arm\u201d); id . at 3 -4 (\u201cThe Omni rig schematic \nshows that the HEROPort extends through\u2014but is not on\u2014an opening in the purported support arm.\u201d))   But the Court does not see how that is required by any of the claim constructions that \nhave been issued in the case.  Nor is it clear that it is otherwise required by the relevant claim \nlanguage.  If Defendant wished to pursue this point as a claim construction issue , it should have \nsaid so i n its opening brief, proposed a construction for a relevant term, and mustered evidence to \ndemonstrate why that construction was correct.  It did none of those things. \n7D efendant makes a third summary judgment argument regarding \u201creceptacles\u201d \nand the Omni.  It is not well set out in Defendant\u2019s opening brief, and so it is somewhat confusing to follow.  (D.I. 223 at 21-22; see also  D.I. 234 at 17 (Plaintiff noting that in its \nopening brief, Defendant \u201cdoes not even introduce what [this alternative theory] is to the Court\u201d))  Defendant\u2019s position here has to do with an alternative argument that Dr. King made about how the \u201couter covers\u201d of the Omni \u201ccombined with the HeroPorts\u201d can amount to \n\u201creceptacles.\u201d  (King Opening Report at 15 -18; see also  D.I. 234 at 17-19)  In the end, however, \nDefendant acknowledges that this third argument for dismissal \u201crises and falls\u201d with its second argument (set out above):  that there can be no infringement as to the Omni because the Omni\u2019s  \nalleged \u201creceptacles\u201d are not sufficiently located on  the protrusions/\u201csupport arms.\u201d  (D.I. 242 at \n3) Having already rejected Defendant\u2019s second argument on that score, the Court similarly do es\nso again here as to Defendant\u2019s third argument.26 ii. The Abyss Rig\nWith regard to the Abyss rig, Plaintiff\u2019s position is that, in the picture s below :  (1) the \nsupport body of the Abyss is the \u201cinner cube frame [,]\u201d and the \u201creceptacles\u201d are \u201cformed by the \nfour metal bolts, the plate, and the central hold that together hold a camera  in place[.]\u201d  (King \nOpening Report at 101- 02; see also  Tr. at 92 (Defendant\u2019s counsel noting that, according to \nPlaintiff, the \u201calleged receptacle is the portion that retains the camera against the back of the \ndome\u201d) )  \n27 D\nefendant \u2019s summary judgment argument as to the Abyss begins with the fact that \nindependent claim s 1, 22 and 30 require the \u201creceptacles\u201d to be \u201cdisposed . . . about the exterior  \nof the\u201d support body.  ( '019 patent, col. 22:31-32 (emphasis added); id ., col. 23:58-59 (emphasis \nadded); id., col. 24:29-30 (emphasis added) )  It then argues that the plain meaning of \u201c disposed . \n. . about the exterior \u201d refers to something that is \u201cexternal or located outside relative to another \nobject\u201d; thus, it asserts that there can be no infringement of the se claims , because the alleged \n\u201creceptacles \u201d are instead located  entirely  inside  or interior to the alleged support body/inner \ncube (as depicted above) .  (D.I. 223 at 22-23; D.I. 242 at 9; Tr. at 92; see also  D.I. 225, ex. 26 at \nex. A at \u00b6 55(e) (Dr. Pratt asserting that this is so , as a POSITA would understand that the plain \nand ordinary meaning of \u201cabout the exterior\u201d is  \u201coutside the perimeter defining the support \nbody.\u201d ))  The Court finds this argument to be persuasive.    \nPlaintiff  tries to counter Defendant\u2019s position by citing to Dr. King\u2019s opinion, in which \nDr. King states that :  (1) \u201cabout\u201d means \u201c\u2018near\u2019  or \u2018in the vicinity of[,]\u2019\u201d and the alleged \n\u201creceptacles\u201d are at least located \u201c near\u201d the exterior of the support body; and (2) these \n\u201creceptacles\u201d are exterior to the support body in the sense that \u201cthey are not part of the interior of \nthe support body[.]\u201d  (King Opening Report at 101-02 ( cited in  D.I. 234 at 20); King Reply \n28 Report at 16 ( cited in D.I. 234 at 20))  With regard to  Dr. King\u2019s first assertion , it is clearly  off \nbase.  Th e claim term at issue here is not simply \u201cabout\u201d \u2014it is \u201cabout the exterior .\u201d  Being \n\u201cnear\u201d to the exterior is clearly not the same thing as being \u201cabout the exterior [,]\u201d which \nconnotes being on the exterior  of an item.   (D.I. 223 at 23 (noting that Dr. King\u2019s interpretation \n\u201cwrites \u2018exterior\u2019 out of the claim language\u201d))  One can have one\u2019s nose pressed right up against \nthe interior side of a glass window pane, and in such a scenario, the person\u2019s nose would \ncertainly be \u201cnear\u201d the exterior of the window pane.  But it would not be \u201cabout the exterior\u201d of that pane of glass.  And Dr. King\u2019s second assertion also misses the mark.  His contention that \nthe \u201creceptacles\u201d infringe so long as they are \u201cnot part of the interior\u201d of the support body is wrong.  Pursuant to the claims at issue, the \u201creceptacles\u201d need to be disposed \u201cabout the exterior\u201d of that body; whether they are considered part of the \u201cinterior\u201d of the body does not speak to whether they are \u201cabout the exterior \u201d of that body.   \nUltimately, the Court agrees with Defendant that the plain and ordinary meaning of \n\u201cabout the exterior\u201d is \u201cexternal or located outside relative to another object.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 22)  At a minimum, this  construction would require that at  least some portion of the \u201creceptacle\u201d (if \nnot its entirety) is  actually located external to or outside of the support body.  And Plaintiff has \nnot demonstrated that any portion of the alleged \u201creceptacles\u201d in the Abyss are so situated.  Thus, summary judgment should be granted as to literal infringement regarding the Abyss rig and asserted claims 1, 22 and 30 (and all asserted claims depending therefrom).      \niii. The Odyssey Rig\nWith regard to the Odyssey, Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the \u201creceptacles\u201d are \u201cformed by \nthe plastic of the Odyssey frame together with the [orange] lever and [orange] backpack tha t 29 holds a camera in place[.]\u201d  (King Opening Report at 67-68 ( cited in  D.I. 234 at 21))  This is \ndepicted below: \n(Id. a\nt 68)  In other words, Plaintiff  is arguing that this combination of three elements together \ndoes what a \u201creceptacle\u201d does:  it \u201creceive[s]  and hold[s] a camera in place.\u201d  (King Reply \nReport at 17 ( cited in  D.I. 234 at 21) (internal quotation marks omitted)) \nThe problem here for Plaintiff is that it has already identified the Odyssey\u2019s frame as the \nclaimed support body and the orange lever and orange backpack (either individually or together) \nas the claimed support arms.  This matters because, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has explained in B ecton,  Dickinson  & Co. v. Tyco Healthcare Grp., LP , 616 F.3d \n1249 (Fed. Cir. 2010), \u201c[w]here a claim lists elements separately, the clear implication of the \nclaim language is that those elements are distinct components of the patented invention.\u201d  616 F.3d at 1254 (internal quotation marks, citation and brackets omitted).  Here the asserted claimsdo list, inter alia , a support arm and a \u201creceptacle\u201d as separate elements .  And so this creates a \npresumption that in order to infringe the claims , the accused product would have to have a \nseparate  portion or physical structure that amounts to a support arm and a \u201creceptacle,\u201d \nrespectively.  Indeed, as was the case in Becton , if the same exact portion or structure  of the \n30 Odyssey could serve both as the support arm on the one hand, and the \u201creceptacle\u201d on the other \nhand, it would render the claims \u201cnonsensical.\u201d  Id. at 1255.  As  was noted above, t he claims \nrequire the \u201creceptacles \u201d to be \u201cdisposed\u201d on/\u201cprovided\u201d on/\u201carranged\u201d on the support arms.  \nHow could a \u201creceptacle\u201d be disposed on a \u201csupport arm\u201d if the receptacle was the exact same structure  as the support arm?\n8  The answer seems clear:  it cannot be so.  For these reasons, \nPlaintiff\u2019s attempt to generate a dispute of material fact as to literal infringement regarding the relevant asserted claims must fai l.\n9 \niv. Conclusion\n  In light of the above, the Court recommends that Defendant\u2019s Motion be GRANTED-\nIN-PART  with regard to the \u201creceptacles\u201d limitation, in that:  (1) summary judgment be granted \nas to literal infringement regarding asserted claims 1, 22 and 30 (and those asserted claims \ndepending therefrom) as to the Abyss device; and (2) summary judgment be granted as to literal infringement regarding th e asserted claims as to the Odyssey device.   It recommends that \nDefendant\u2019s Motion in this regard otherwise be DENIED .   \nc. \u201cLatching Feature\u201d Limitation\n8The specification also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion here.  Nothing in the \ns\npecification indicates  that the \u201creceptacle\u201d can be the exact same structure as the support arm .  \nIndeed, in every embodiment listed in the specification, those terms refer to  distinct elements.  \n(See, e.g., '019 patent , cols. 6:55-7:54, 9:56-10:51; id ., FIGS. 1 a, 1e, 3e, 4e , 7e; Tr. at 120-21 \n(\u201cFor example, the embodiments that we have looked at in the '019 patent eac h have separate \nsupport arms, receptacles, and latching features.  They do not reuse the same structure for . . . \ndifferent purposes.\u201d) ); see also Becton , 616 F.3d at 1254-55.  \n9Having so concluded, the Court need not address Defendant\u2019s other argument s  for \nnon-infringement as to the Odyssey with regard to the \u201creceptacles\u201d limitation.   (D.I. 223 at 25) 31 Independent c laims 1, 15 and 22, as well as dependent claim 34,  all require  that the \nreceptacle have a \u201clatching feature\u201d for enabling a camera to be releasably secured or retained.  \n(D.I. 223 at 26)  The Court construed \u201clatching feature\u201d to mean a \u201cstructural element for \nsecurement and release.\u201d  (Id. at 12)   \nDefendant asserts that summary judgment is warranted because all three of the accused \nrigs do not have a \u201clatching feature.\u201d  The Court again addresses this argument on a rig-by- rig \nbasis.  \ni. The Omn i\nWith regard to the alleged \u201clatching feature\u201d of the Omni, Defendant \u2019s first argu ment is \nthat Plaintiff again has a Becton  problem.  More specifically, as was previously noted above, \nPlaintiff identifies the male ends of the HEROPort, either alone or in conjunction with the Omni\u2019s outer panels, as the receptacle (i.e., the structure that receives and holds a camera in place).  See supra  at p. 22; see also, e.g., (King Opening Report at 14-15; King Reply Report at \n13 (\u201cThe HeroPor t extending from the support arm is the receptacle as it is \u2018the structure to \nreceive and hold a camera in place\u2019 for the Omni\u2019\u201d) ).  But Plaintiff is also asserting that the \n\u201clatching feature\u201d amounts to :  (1) the \u201cend of the HeroPort that attaches to the camera using an \ninterference fit [,]\u201d since th at \u201cportion of the \u201cHeroPort\u201d purportedly \u201cprovides for \u2018securement \nand release\u2019\u201d; or (2) in the alternative, the end of the HEROPort together with Omni rig\u2019s outer panels.   (King Opening Report at 14-15, 24-25, 30-32, 42, 44, 55-57; King Reply Report at 13; \nsee also  D.I. 234 at 23)  In other words, Plaintiff is attempting to use the same structure(s) in the \nOmni rig to satisfy multiple claim elements \u2014to be both the receptacle and the \u201clatching feature.\u201d  \n(D.I. 223 at 26)   32 However, unlike with the dispute over the receptacles in the Odyssey, the Court is not \nconvinced that Becton  and its progeny dictate that summary judgment should be granted here.   \nTo be sure, Becton  explains that the general presumption is that when a claim lists two elements \nseparately,  those elements will be understood to be distinct components of the invention.  But th e \nFederal Circuit has also emphasized that a party can overcome this presumption.  See Powell v. \nHome Depot U.S.A., Inc ., 663 F.3d 1221, 1231 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  If, for example, a patent\u2019s \ndisclosures indicate that two separate claim elements could be satisfied by the same structure or component, the n there is no bar to the type of infringem ent argument that Plaintiff mak es here.  \nId. (concluding that the claims\u2019 \u201ccutting box\u201d and \u201cdust collection structure\u201d elements could be \nmet by the same component in an accused product, where the specification disclosed that the \u201ccutting box\u201d \u201c\u2018functions to contain the sawdust and woodchips generated as the blade cuts through the wood\u2019\u201d and thus that it could also serve as the \u201cdust collection structure\u201d) ; see also  \nSkedco, Inc. v. Strategic Operations, Inc., 685 F. App\u2019x 956, 960 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (concluding that the claimed \u201cpump\u201d and \u201cvalve\u201d could be satisfied by a \u201cpump\u201d that housed an internal \u201cvalve,\u201d such that the two structures were not physically separated,  since \u201cnothing in the agreed-\nupon constructions of \u2018pump\u2019 and \u2018valve\u2019 forbids a pump from housing an internal valve\u201d and because permitting such an infringement read would not render the claims \u201cnonsensical [,]\u201d as \nwas the case in Becton ).  Here in the relevant claims, the \u201clatching feature\u201d is not described as \nsomething that necessarily has to be an entirely separate structure from  the receptacles .  Instead, \nthe claims make clear that the \u201clatching feature\u201d is a feature of the receptacle itself.  ( See, e.g ., \n'019 patent, col. 22:30-36 ; id., col. 23:30-32; id., col. 23:58-64; id., col. 24:50-53)  In light of \nthis, it does not appear that the claims would be rendered \u201cnonsensical\u201d if all or a part of the 33 receptacle was also said to be the \u201clatching feature .\u201d  And Defendant did not really explain why \nthis would be so in its briefing.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 242 at 6)   \nDefendant\u2019s second argument is a prosecution disclaimer argument .  Here it asserts that, \nin light of a position that Plaintiff took during the IPR (regarding whether a POSITA would be \nmotivated to combine two pieces of prior art, \u201cKayanuma\u201d and \u201cQing\u201d), Plaintiff has previously disclaimed the claim scope that it now argues for.  (D.I. 223 at 26-27 (citing D.I. 226, ex. 36 at 44-45) )  Prosecution disclaimer requires a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d disavowal of claim scope,\nAylus Networks, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 856 F.3d 1353, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and the Court strongly doubts that this is what occurred in the IPR as to this issue.  But even if the Court is wrong on that score, there is another reason why this argument should fail:  Defendant did not sufficiently develop it in  its briefing.  Prosecution \ndisclaimer is a tenet of claim construction, and so in essence, what Defendant is really arguing is that the claim term \u201clatching feature\u201d \u2014a term that has already been construed  by the California \nCourt, (D.I. 226, ex. 35 at 7-9)\u2014should now be re -construed in order to account for the alleged \ndisavowal of ce rtain claim scope.   But if that is so,  then  Defendant should have proposed a new \nconstruction for this  term in its opening brief, and explained  why that new construction comports \nwith Defendant\u2019s assertions as to what actually occurred during the IPR.  Defendant did not do this here, which hindered the Court\u2019 s ability to assess the issue .  (D.I. 223 at 26-27)\n10  And  so the \nCourt will not further address Defendant\u2019s  position.  Cf. supra n.6.   \n10F or example, from  its briefing  it seems Defendant  could be suggesting that, in \nlight of the alleged disclaimer, the proper construction for \u201clatching feature\u201d is \u201cstructural \nelement for securement and release that can be used with any type of camera.\u201d  But the Court cannot be sure that this is what Defendant intends .  And Defendant\u2019s failure to be more specific \non this point resulted in a confused record.  34 Defendant\u2019s third and final argument relates to the fact  that, on the Omni rig, there are at \nleast six recessed screws  on two brackets that must be loosened in order to remove a camera \nfrom the rig; one way to do so (suggested by the manufacturer) is to use an Allen hex key to \nunscrew the screws.  (D.I. 225, ex. 26 at ex. A  at \u00b6 47.c. ( cited in  D.I. 223 at 27) ; Defendant\u2019 s \nHearing Presentation, Slide 42)  Defendant notes that during claim construction, when the California Court was explaining the reasons for its construction of \u201clatching feature,\u201d it stated  \nthat the \u201cprosecution history necessarily disclaims systems . . . that prevent the attachment or release of a camera without tools, screws , or similar[ .]\u201d  (D.I. 226, ex. 35 at 9)  Defendant goes \non to argue that, in light of the California Court\u2019s ration ale, the fact that one must loosen screws \nin order to eventually get access to a camera in the Omni means that the Omni cannot possibly read on the claims.  (D.I. 223 at 27) \nFor at least two reasons, the Court disagrees that summary judgment is warranted on this \nground.  For one thing, the Court is not even sure that this argument is really about the meaning of the claim term \u201clatching feature.\u201d  I f there is to be a dispute about whether the claims permit a \ncamera to be attached to a rig with screws , it seems that issue would more likely be relevant to \nthe construction of the claim terms \u201c releasably retained\u201d/ \u201creleasably secured \u201d/\u201creleasably and \nindividually retaining,\u201d (found either in claims 1, 15, 22 or 34) or to the claim term \u201cwithout requiring tools\u201d (found in claim 15, and a term that  the Court has already addressed via claim \nconstruction), (D.I. 139 at 1- 6).  And in order to make a f air presentment of th at issue , Defendant \nwould be required, at a minimum, to:  (1) identify the correct claim term at issue ; and (2) explain \nhow that term should be construed (or, in the case of \u201cwithout requiring tools,\u201d explain how the Court\u2019s prior construction necessarily dictates  the result).  But Defendant did not do so.   35 Additionally, in the Court\u2019s prior discussion of the \u201cwithout requiring tools\u201d term, it \nnoted that Plaintiff\u2019s statements during prosecution about a prior art reference (\u201cWeiss\u201d)  simply \ndisclaimed assemblies that absolutely  required  tools or fasteners in order to remove the cameras \nat issue.  (D.I. 139 at 5-6)  The Court also explained that if an accused device is \u201cconfigured in \nsuch a way that it does not require  the use of tools to releasably secure such cameras (and if \none\u2019s fingers can, for example, be used instead for this process), then such a scenario does not fall into the realm of what was disclaimed. \u201d  (Id. (emphasis in original))  And here, Dr. King has \nopined that the screws holding together the Omni need not be removed solely via use of a hex key tool ; instea d, they may be removed by \u201cfinger turning.\u201d  (King Reply Report at 13; see also  \nid. at 19 (\u201cThe screws holding together the Omni . . . may be finger tightened and loosened.\u201d); \nD.I. 242 at 8 (Defendant acknowledging Dr. King\u2019s statement in this regard, and not disputingthat it is accurate, but instead arguing that \u201c[t]hat is true for almost anything requiring screws, but it does not make the resulting item usable in the normal course\u201d))  Thus, even had this claim construction/infringement issue been properly presented, there would still be a genuine issue of material fact pre venting summary judgment.     \nii. The Abyss\nWith regard to  the Abyss , Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the \u201celastic band anchored to two \nof the metal protrusions [in the receptacle ]\u201d is the claimed \u201clatching feature\u201d\u2014and  this band \n\u201csecures and allows for release of the camera and enables the camera to be releasably retained within the defined enclosure[.]\u201d  (King Opening Report at 102; see also  Tr. at 91)  This elastic \nband is shown in the picture below: 36 (\nDefendant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 33)   \nIn seeking summary judgment here, Defendant argues that :  (1) in a preliminary response \nit filed during the IPR, Plaintiff clearly and unmistakably asserted that a rubber band just like the \nelastic band at issue above could not serve as a claimed \u201clatching  feature\u201d; and (2) this amounts \nto a clear and unmistakable disclaimer of claim scope that renders Plaintiff\u2019s infringement read toothless.  The Court agrees.  \nIn the IPR preliminary response, Plaintiff was attempting to explain why the Geerds \nreference di d not disclose or teach a \u201clatching feature,\u201d as that term is used in the patents .  In \ndoing so, Plaintiff noted that \u201cGeerds had to use what appears to be a rubber band around [ the \ncamera] to hold the camera in place\u201d\u2014i.e., the item that Defendant had ide ntified in the IPR as \nthe \u201clatching feature\u201d at issue.  (D.I. 226 at 27-28)  Below is a picture of the Geerds device, with the black rubber band visible at the top: \n37 (\nKing Reply Report at 17)  In its  IPR filing, Plaintiff then went on to explain why Defendant\u2019s \ninvalidity argument about Geerds could not be correct:  \u201cEven though the rubber band seems to \nfunction to retain the camera in place, it is not something that a POSITA would refer to as a \u2018latching feature.\u2019 . . .  Therefore, Geerds  fails to disclose such a structural element as required \nby the California Court claim construction, so Geerds cannot anticipate at least claims 1, 15 and 22 for these reasons.\u201d  (D.I. 226, ex. 36 at 30)   \nThis statement by Plaintiff  was clear and unmistakable.  It unambiguously conveyed  that \nan elastic or rubber band simply cannot amount to a \u201cstructural element for securement and \nrelease\u201d (i.e., a \u201clatching feature\u201d).\n11  In its briefing regarding the MSJ, Plaintiff suggests that \ndisclaimer did not occur, but in support it simply points to Dr. King\u2019s Reply Report; therein, Dr. King states only that \u201c[t]he elastic band Dr. Pratt mentioned with respect to the [preliminary response] was on the Geerds device which did not include the dome assembly [that is found in \n11Plaintiff does not suggest in its briefing (nor could it credibly) that there is any \nm\neaningful distinction between the \u201crubber\u201d band used in Geerds and the \u201celastic\u201d band used in \nthe Abyss.    \n38 the Abyss]\u201d and thus the \u201cstatement [in the preliminary response] does not apply to the Abyss.\u201d  \n(King Reply Report at 17 ( cited in  D.I. 234 at 26- 27))  But as Defendant notes, (D.I. 242 at 8-9), \nthe fact that the Abyss is a different  device than the Geerds structure  (of course it is), or the fact \nthat the Abyss contains a dome or certain  components that the Geerds device does not have (of \ncourse it does), is of no moment.  What matters is that in this case, Plaintiff has been pointing to \nthe elast ic band in the Abyss as the thing that amounts to a \u201clatching feature.\u201d  (King Opening \nReport at 102)  And  yet in the IPR, Plaintiff said that an elastic /rubber band cannot be a \u201clatching \nfeature.\u201d  (D.I. 242 at 8-9; Tr. at 91-92)  The whole point of the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer is that a party may not \u201cargue[ the claims] one way in order to maintain their patentability and in a different way against accused infringers.\u201d  Aylus , 856 F.3d at 1360 (internal \nquotation and citation omitted).  Here, Pl aintiff is trying to do just that, and its efforts should not \nbe countenanced.  See Midwest Athletics & Sports All. LLC v. Ricoh USA, Inc ., Case No. 2:19-\ncv-00514-JDW, 2021 WL 3722329, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 23, 2021).\nThe Court recommends that summary judgment be granted as to the Abyss on this \nground. \niii. The Odyssey\nAs for the Odyssey, Defendant again cites to Becton  and its progeny and argues that \nPlaintiff is impermissibly relying on the same structures (the orange levers) to be both the \u201clatching feature\u201d and the support arms in the rig.  (D.I. 223 at 28; D.I. 242 at 10)  Defendant is correct :  Plaintiff is in fact asserting that the orange levers are the \u201clatching feature\u201d and it is also \nasserting that the levers constitute support arms (or alternatively,  that the levers and the orange \nbackpacks together amount to support arms).  (D.I. 234 at 27; see, e.g ., King Opening Report at \n66, 69)   39 For the same reasons as were set out above in Section II.A. 2.b.iii. , the Court agrees with \nDefendant  that summary judgment is warranted .  As in the dispute regarding the \u201creceptacles\u201d \nlimitation, here :  (1) th e claims utilize separate terms for support arms and \u201clatching feature ,\u201d \nwhich leads to a presumption that the terms are to be embodied by separate structures in the \naccused products; and (2) more significantly, because a \u201clatching feature\u201d is a feature of a receptacle, and because a receptacle is disposed/arranged/provided on a support arm, it would \nnot make sense that the \u201clatching feature\u201d could be the exact same structure as all or part of the support arm on which the latching feature /receptacle  is supposed to be \ndisposed/arranged/provided.   \niv. Conclusion\nIn light of the above, t he Court recommends that Defendant\u2019s Motion be GRANTED- IN-\nPART  with regard to the \u201clatching feature\u201d limitation, in that:  (1) summary judgment be granted \nas to literal infringement regarding all relevant asserted claims  (i.e., claims 1, 15 and 22 and 34 \nand any asserted claims dependent therefrom) as to the Abyss rig; and (2) summary judgment be granted as to  literal infringement regarding  all relevant asserted claims as to the Odyssey rig .  It \nrecommends that Defendant\u2019s Motion in this regard otherwise be DENIED  regarding literal \ninfringement as to all relevant asserted claims in  the Omni rig .   \nd. Doctrine of Equivalents\nFinally, Defendant  seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff\u2019s infringement \narguments that rely on the doctrine of equivalents (\u201cDOE\u201d) .  (D.I. 223 at 28-32; see also  D.I. \n226, ex. 51 (listing Plaintiff\u2019s various DOE arguments))  It does so on two different bases . \nFirst, Defendant argues that Dr. King\u2019s opinions as to how the relevant components of the \naccused rigs satisfy the \u201cfunction, way, result\u201d test amount to \u201cunsupported conclusory 40 opinions[.]\u201d  (D.I. 242 at 13; see also  D.I. 223 at 29-30)  To be sure, Dr. King\u2019s articulation of \nhow the \u201cfunction, way, result\u201d test was met could have been more robust.  (D.I. 226, ex. 51)  It \nmay well not stand up to scrutiny at trial.  But in every instance that Defendant references where \nPlaintiff has attempted resort to the DOE, Dr.  King appears to have done more than just utilize \nconclusory language.  In other words, Dr. King did not just  parrot back the relevant legal \nterminology associated with the \u201cfunction, way, result\u201d test and then add in a f ew buzzwords \nfrom the relevant accused products.  Instead, as to each element  of the test, Dr. King at least \noffer ed a brief articulation of why it is  that this element was met  (and in doing so, he made \nreference to what the claim requires , and why the assertedly equivalent component was, in fact, \nequivalent).  ( Id.; Tr. at 118-19) ; see also Cooper Notification, Inc. v. Twitter, Inc ., 867 F. Supp. \n2d 485, 496 (D. Del. 2012) (requiring that, in order to withstand summary judgment, a patentee\u2019s DOE claim must include a \u201cmeaningful explanation of why or how Defendants\u2019 accused systems are equivalent to the asserted claims w ith respect to the [relevant claim requirement]\u201d) .  In sum, \nthe Court cannot recommend a grant of summary judgment on this basis.   \nDefendant\u2019s second argument is that prosecution history estoppel\n12 bars Plaintiff from \nregaining certain subject matter it relinquished during the IPR when it added the support arm and latching feature limitations.  (D.I. 223 at 30- 31)  This argument relates to the fact that, during \nprosecution, a third party submitted printouts from two websites\u2014including what the parties \n12P rosecution disclaimer applies to the determination of literal infringement by \nexcluding from a claim construction any claim scope that was clearly and unmistakably \ndisavowed during prosecution; similarly, prosecution history estoppel prevents a party from using the DOE to recapture subject matter clearly and unmistakably surrendered from the literal scope of a claim during prosecution.  Trading Techs. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Open E Cry, LLC , 728 F.3d \n1309, 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Omega En g\u2019g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1326 n.1 \n(Fed. Cir. 2003). 41 refer to as the \u201cChegado printout\u201d\u2014to the Examiner; the Examiner rejected the pending claims \nin view of the cube-shaped camera rig shown in the Chegado printout (and depicted below): \n (\nD.I. 223 at 31)  Plaintiff responded by amending the independent claims of the patent.  In doing \nso, it distinguished the Chegado printout by arguing that the printout failed to teach the amended claim\u2019s requirements of a \u201csupport body having a plurality of outwardly and radially extending support arms and in which an open-ended receptacle having a latching feature is provided on each of the support arms\u201d because it appears to define a \u201ccubically shaped housing that fully retains and supports photographic apparatus within the confines of the housing.\u201d  ( Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted))  Defendant argues that :  (1) these comments disclaimed \nrigs that have components that \u201cretain[] and support[] cameras within the confines of the housing[;]\u201d and (2) P laintiff cannot now assert that the three accused rigs infringe, since it is \nclear that  all of  the relevant components in all three rigs are clearly internal to the rigs\u2019 housing.  \n(Id. at 31-32 (emphasis added) )   \nThe Court, however, is not comfortable granting summary judgment on this basis either .  \nFor one thing, at times it appears that Plaintiff is identifying items as support arms/receptacles/latching features  that are a part of the exterior  of the rigs\u2019 housing.  Are those \ninstances where the accused elements are entirely \u201cwithin the confines of the housing\u201d of the rig?  \n42 It is not clear that they are.  Moreover, the Court wishes that Defendant took more time with this \nargument.  It would have been better had Defendant laid out, in a detailed fashion , why every \nasserted support arm/receptacle/ latching feature as to all three accused rigs could not meet the \nstandard that the Plaintiff allegedly set when describing the Chegado printout.  In  the absence of \nthat type of detailed argument, the Court simply does not have enough to go on to recommend grant of summary judgment.   \nFor these reasons, the Court will recommend that the MSJ be DENIED  as to its efforts to \nseek dismissal of Plaintiff\u2019 s DOE arguments.   \nB. Daubert -Related Issues\nThe remainder of the Motion relates to  Defendant\u2019s  Daubert  challenges  (hereinafter \nreferred to as the \u201cDaubert  motions\u201d).  The disputes raised in the se Daubert motions regard:  (1) \ncertain opinions provided by Plaintiff\u2019s damages expert, Scott A. Bayley, in his opening expert report  on damages , (D.I. 237, ex. E (hereinafter, \u201cBayley Opening Report\u201d)), and his reply expert \nreport  on damages , (D.I. 237, ex. D (h ereinafter, \u201cBayley Reply Report\u201d)) ; and (2) certain \nopinions provided by Plaintiff\u2019s technical expert, Dr. King, in the King Opening Report, in Dr.  \nKing \u2019s rebuttal expert report  on validity, (D.I. 237, ex. G (hereinafter, \u201cKing Rebuttal Report\u201d)), \nand in the King Reply Report.   \nWith its Motion, Defendant asserts that all of Mr. Bayley\u2019s and portions of Dr. King\u2019s \nopinions and testimony regarding lost profits should be excluded\u2014and that, as a result, summary judgment should be granted to it as to Plaintiff\u2019s claim for lost profits.   (D.I. 223 at 2-3, 32-45)  \nDefendant also argues that portions of Mr. Bayley\u2019s opinions and testimony regarding a 43 reasonable royalty should be excluded\u2014and that, as a result, summary judgment should be \ngranted as to Plaintiff\u2019s claim for a reasonable royalty.  ( Id. at 2, 45-49)13   \nBelow, the Court will first set out the relevant legal standards for a Daubert  challenge.  \nThereafter, it will address Defendant\u2019s arguments  on the merits .   \n1. Daubert  Motions\nR\nule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of qualified expert \ntestimony, providing that a witness may testify if:  \u201c(a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand t he evidence or to determine a fact \nin issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles or methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\u201d  Fed. R. Evid. 702.  Rule 702\u2019s requirements were examined in detail in \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) (\u201c Daubert \u201d), and have been said to \nembody \u201cthree distinct substantive restrictions on the admission of expert testimony:  qualifications, reliability, and fit.\u201d  Elcock v. Kmart Corp., 233 F.3d 734, 741 (3d Cir. 2000); see also B. Braun Melsungen AG v. Terumo Med. Corp., 749 F. Supp. 2d 210, 222 (D. Del. 2010).\n14      \nWith regard to the qualification s requirement, a n expert is qualified if \u201cthe witness \npossess[es] specialized expertise.\u201d  Schneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried , 320 F.3d 396, \n404 (3d Cir. 2003). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit interprets this requirement liberally, and has observed that \u201ca broad range of knowledge, skills, and training \n13So far as the Court can tell, Defendant never specifies which particular paragraphs \nof\n the relevant expert reports should be stricken. \n14In applying Rule 702 to a patent action, the Court will look to the law of the \nr\negional circuit.   Info -Hold , Inc. v. Muzak LLC , 783 F.3d 1365, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  44 qualify an expert as such.\u201d  In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 741 (3d Cir. 1994); \nsee also Schneider , 320 F.3d at 404.  \nAs to the reliability requirement, Rule 702 mandates that the relevant expert testimony \n\u201cmust be supported by appropriate validation\u2014i.e. , \u2018good grounds,\u2019 based on what is known.\u201d  \nDaubert , 509 U.S. at 590; see also Schneider , 320 F.3d at 406.  Such testimony should amount to \n\u201cmore than subjective belief or unsupported speculation[]\u201d and a court\u2019s focus in examining this factor must be on \u201cprinciples and methodology\u201d rather than on the expert\u2019s conclusions.  Daubert , 509 U.S. at 590, 595; see also  Daddio v. Nemours Found., 399 F. App\u2019x 711, 713 (3d \nCir. 2010).  The grounds for the expert\u2019s opinion \u201cmerely have to be good, they do not have to be perfect\u201d; thus, the standard for reliability is \u201cnot that high.\u201d  Paoli , 35 F.3d. at 744-45. \nWith regard to the \u201cfit\u201d requirement, it \u201c goes primarily to relevance[,]\u201d as the testimony \nmust \u201c assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\u201d and have \n\u201ca valid . . . connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\u201d  Daubert , 509 \nU.S. at 591- 92 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Schneider , 320 F.3d at \n404. The standard for fit, however, is not a high one; it is met \u201c when there is a clear \u2018fit\u2019\nconnecting the issue in the case with the expert\u2019 s opinion that will aid the jury in determining an \nissue in the case. \u201d  Meadows v. Anchor Longwall & Rebuild, Inc., 306 F. App\u2019x 781, 790 (3d \nCir. 2009) (citations omitted). \nOverall, \u201cRule 702 embodies a \u2018liberal policy of admissibility.\u2019\u201d  B. Braun Melsungen \nAG, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 222 (quoting Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir. \n2008)).  Nonetheless, the burden is placed on the party offering expert testimony to show that it meets each of the standards for admissibility.  Id.  (citing Daubert , 509 U.S. at 592 n.10). \n2. Lost Profits45 The Court first addresses Defendant\u2019s challenge to Mr. Bayley \u2019s and Dr. King\u2019s relevant \nlost profits -related opinions.   \nGenerally, there are two alternative types of compensatory damages15 that may be \nrecovered in a patent case:  (1) the patentee\u2019s lost profits; or (2) the \u201creasonable royalty [the \npatentee] would have received through arms-length bargaining.\u201d  Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  With  regard to the first of these\u2014an award of lost \nprofits damages\u2014it is a legal question as to whether such damages are available in a given case.  DePuy Spine, Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc ., 567 F.3d 1314, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2009). \nThe goal of awarding lost profits damages is to \u201c place the patentee in the same position it \nwould have occupied had there been no infringement.\u201d  Mentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA, Inc., 851 F.3d 1275, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  \u201cTo recover lost profits as opposed to royalties, a \npatent owner must prove a causal relation between the infringement and its loss of profits.\u201d  BIC Leisure Prods., Inc. v. Windsurfing Int\u2019l, Inc., 1 F.3d 1214, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  The burden rests on the patent owner to \u201cshow a reasonable probability that, \u2018but for\u2019 the infringement, it would have made the sales that were made by the infringer. \u201d  Rite -Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co. , 56 \nF.3d 1538, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc).  The \u201cbut for\u201d inquiry requires a reconstruction ofthe market as it would have developed absent the infringing product, to determine what the patentee would have made.  Grain Processing Corp. v. Am. Maize-Prods. Co., 185 F.3d 1341, \n15T he purpose of compensatory damages in patent cases is \u201cnot to punish the \ninfringer, but to make the patentee whole.\u201d  Pall Corp. v. Micron Separations, Inc., 66 F.3d \n1211, 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  To that end, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 (\u201cSection 284\u201d), damages awarded for patent infringement \u201cmust reflect the value attributable to the infringing features of the product, and no more.\u201d  Commonwealth Sci. & Indus. Research Organisation v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 809 F.3d 1295, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   46 1350 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ; see also Mentor Graphics , 851 F.3d at 1285 (\u201c [T]he fact finder\u2019s job is to \ndetermine what would the patent holder have made (what would his profits have been) if the \ninfringer had not infringed.\u201d ).  While this is a hypothetical enterprise , in that it requires the \npatent ee to project economic results that did not occur, the Federal Circuit has explained that it \nnevertheless \u201crequires sound economic proof of the nature of the market and likely outcomes \nwith infringement factored out of the economic picture.\u201d  Grain Processing, 185 F.3d at 1350.  While such damages may not be based on speculation, they also need not be proved with unerring precision either.  Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Johnson & Johnson Orthopaedics, Inc., 976 F.2d 1559, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1992).   \nThe Panduit test, set out in Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc., 575 F.2d \n1152 (6th Cir. 1978), establishes an acceptable (though non- exclusive) framework for a patentee \nto show the required \u201cbut for\u201d causation.  Rite -Hite, 56 F.3d at 1545.  Under this  test, the \npatentee must make a showing of:  (1) demand for the patented product; (2) absence of acceptable non -infringing alternatives; (3) manufacturing and marketing capability to exploit the \ndemand; and (4) the amount of profit it would have made.  Panduit , 575 F.2d at 1156.  If the \npatentee establishes each of the Pa nduit  factors, the court may reasonably infer that the claimed \nlost profits were caused by the infringing sales, thus establishing a patentee\u2019 s prima facie case \nwith respect to \u201cbut for\u201d causation.  Rite -Hite, 56 F.3d at 1545.  The burden then shifts to the \nalleged infringer to show that the inference is unreasonable for some or all of the lost sales.  Id.    \nWith the relevant law now set out, below the Court will assess Defendant\u2019s challenge to \nMr. Ba yley\u2019s and Dr. King\u2019s lost profits opinions in order.  \na. Mr. Bayley \u2019s Lost Profits Opinion s47 Defendant requests that the Court exclude the entirety of Mr. Bayley \u2019s lost profits \nopinions on the grounds of unreliability  and lack of fit, arguing that there are defects in his \nanalysis relating to the Panduit  factors.   (D.I. 223 at 32-35, 37-41; Tr. at 8-9; D.I. 242 at 14-23)  \nWere the Court to do so, it argues that Plaintiff\u2019 s claim to lost profits damages would then be \nunsupported and should thus be dismissed.   \ni. First Panduit  Factor\nThe first Panduit  factor \u201csimply asks whether demand existed for the \u2018patented product,\u2019 \ni.e., a product that is \u2018covered by the patent in suit\u2019 or that \u2018directly competes with the infringing\ndevice.\u2019\u201d  DePuy Spine, Inc., 567 F.3d at  1330 (quoting Rite-Hite Corp., 56 F.3d at  1548-49).  In \nother words, this factor \u201c presupposes that demand for the infringer\u2019s and patent owner\u2019s products \nis interchangeable.\u201d  BIC Leisure Prod s., Inc., 1 F.3d at 1218.  The focus as to this factor is not \non particular product features corresponding to individual claim limitations, or on whether those \nindividual features/limitations drove demand  for the product; instead, the question to be \nanswered is simply whether the patented product as a whole was in demand.  DePuy Spine , 567 \nF.3d at 1330.\nAlthough Defendant made an argument in its opening brief as to this factor, (D.I. 223 at \n38), by the time of its reply brief and at oral argument, it no longer was contesting the factor, (D.I. 242 at 15-23, Tr. at 9).  Moreover, in his reports, M r. Bayley  certainly did cite  to evidence \nindicating that there was demand for rigs like  Plaintiff\u2019s rigs (which are alleged to read on the \nrelevant claims of the patent -in-suit) throughout the relevant damages period.  (Bayley Opening \nReport at \u00b6 43 (noting that in 2013-15, Plaintiff\u2019s total income (driven by sales of its rigs) was nearly $4 million, that Defendant had significant sales of its ac cused products in 2015-2017, and 48 that 360 degree mounts continued to be sold as of the time of his report));16 see Gyromat Corp. v. \nChampion Spark Plug Co., 735 F.2d 549, 552 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (\u201cThe substantial number of sales \n[] of infringing products containing the patented features itself is compelling evidence of the demand for the [patented] product.\u201d) ; see also  BIC Leisure Prod s., Inc., 1 F.3d at 1218-19.   \nTherefore, the Court moves on to the second Panduit  factor.   \nii. Second Panduit  Factor\nThe second Panduit factor requires th at the  patentee demonstrate the absence of \ncommercially acceptable, non- infringing alternatives.  This factor exists \u201c because, if the \ncustomer might have purchased a different, non-infringing product, the patentee cannot establish entitlement to lost profits for  that particular sale.\u201d  Sonos, Inc. v. D & M Holdings Inc., 297 F. \nSupp. 3d 501, 517 (D. Del. 2017).  T he \u201c[m]ere existence of a competing device does not make \nthat device an acceptable substitute.\u201d  TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 789 F.2d 895, 901 (Fed. Cir. 1986).  And a \u201cpatentee need not negate every possibility that the purchaser might not have \npurchased a product other than its own, absent the infringement.\u201d  Rite -Hite, 56 F.3d at 1545.  \nRather, a patentee \u201cneed only show that there was a reasonable pro bability that the sales would \nhave been made \u2018but for\u2019 the infringement.\u201d  Id.    \nUltimately, while the first Panduit  factor considered demand for the patented product as a \nwhole, this factor \u201cconsiders demand for particular limitations or features of the c laimed \ninvention.\u201d  Mentor Graphics , 851 F.3d at  1285.  For example, \u201cif purchasers are motivated to \n16T he particular sales figures that Mr. Bayley cites for Defendant are problematic in \nanother respect, however, in that they do not simply relate to revenue for video rigs and instead \nalso include revenue for (unclaimed) cameras  sold by Defendant.  ( See Bayley Opening Report \nat \u00b6 43; id . at 16 (Table 2); id . at 36 (Table 16))  The Court will address this issue further in \nSection II. B.3.a. 49 purchase because of particular features available only from the patented product, [then] products \nwithout such features\u2014even if otherwise competing in the marketplace\u2014would not be acceptable noninfringing substitutes.\u201d  Cohesive Techs., Inc. v. Waters Corp., 543 F.3d 1351, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  Thus, to prove that there are no acceptable noninfringing substitutes, the patent owner must show either that \u201c(1) the purchasers in the marketplace generally were willing to buy the patented product for its advantages [that were not available in a proposed substitute product], or (2) the specific purchasers of the infringing product purchased on that basis.\u201d  Id .  \u201c[I]f there is a noninfringing alternative which any given \npurchaser would have found acceptable and bought, then the patentee cannot obtain lost profits for that particular sale .\u201d  Mentor Graphics , 851 F.3d at  1286.  S uch a determination is \u201cmade on \na made on a customer -by-customer basis .\u201d  Id. \nIn his reports, Mr. Bayley lists 21 potential substitutes (\u201cpotential substitutes\u201d)  for the \npatented product.\n17  But as Defendant notes, Mr. Bayley does not actually  perform his own \nanalysis to explain why each of the products are non-infringing, or why they are not commercially acceptable.  (D.I.  223 at 33)  Instead, he relies for th ese purposes on:  (1) his \nconversations with Dr. King; and (2) his conversations with Mr. Kintner .  (D.I. 223 at 33-35, 38-\n39; Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6\u00b6 44, 45)   \nWith regard to the referenced conclusions about w hether the potential substitutes are non-\ninfringing, it is pretty clear that there, Mr. Bayley  is relying on Dr. King \u2019s input.  (Bayley Reply \nReport at \u00b6\u00b6 18 -19 (Mr. Bayley stating that he is relying on Dr. King\u2019s opinion in this regard) ; \n17T hese are listed , inter alia , in Table 1 of the Bayley Opening Report.  (D.I. 223 at \n33 (citing Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 45 & Table 1) ) 50 D.I. 226, ex. 55 at 41-42)18  Dr. King is a technical expert in the relevant subject matter , and\nDefendant does not argue that Dr. King is unqualified to opine on whether a particular product \ninfringes the patent- in-suit (nor that Mr. Bayley cannot, in turn, rely on that opinion).   \nIn his Opening Report, Dr. King did  not engage in any analysis of these potential \nsubstitutes from an infringement/non-infringement perspective.  (See King Opening Report at \n141) But in his Reply Report, Dr. King did do that type of analysis.  Therein, he concludes that15 of the 21 potential substitutes are non-infringing, while 6 others do infringe the patent.  (King Reply Report at 2-9; Bayley Reply Report at \u00b6 18 & Table 1)\n19  \nThat brings us to Mr. Bayley\u2019s opinion that none of the potential substitutes  (including all \n15 purportedly non-infringing substitutes) would have been commercially acceptable alternatives  to the patented product.  Here, the record clearly indicates that Mr. Bayley is relying \nsolely on evidentiary input provided by Mr. Kintner\u2014and no one else.\n20   \n18Mr. Bayley\u2019s opening report could be read to suggest that he is also relying on \nM\nr. Kintner\u2019s input on this subject.  (Bayley Opening Report a t \u00b6 44 & n.41)  But the Court \ndeclines to read Mr. Bayley\u2019s report in this way, since it is clear that doing so would be \nproblematic.  Put differently, Mr. Bayley could not rely on Mr. Kintner\u2019s opinions regarding non-infringement because:  (1) this would amount to expert testimony, and Mr. Kintner is not qualified to provide expert opinion on this subject , cf. Webasto Thermo & Comfort N. Am. Inc. v. \nBesTop, Inc ., Case No. 16- cv-13456, 2019 WL 3334563, at *6 (E.D. Mich. July 25, 2019); and \n(2)Mr. Kintner never conducted his own independent analysis on the subject, nor did he share\nthe substance of any such analysis in discovery.  (D.I. 226, ex. 56 at 200-07; D.I. 237, ex. A at193-208; D.I. 243, ex. 4 at 2; Tr. at 14-15, 56-57)  That said, bec ause Mr. Bayley can instead rely\non Dr. King\u2019s opinions as to  this issue, the Court\u2019s conclusion here should not have a material\nimpact on the viability of  this aspect of  Mr. Bayley\u2019s analysis of lost profits damages.\n19Defendant argues that Dr. King\u2019s analysis of non-infringing alternatives in his \nR\neply Report should be stricken as untimely.  (D.I. 223 at 41-42)  The Court will address that \nissue below in Section II. B.2.b, where in it concludes that Defendant\u2019s request is not well- taken .   \n20In his reports, Mr. Bayley states that he obtained information about what was a \nco\nmmercially acceptable alternative from both Mr. Kintner and Dr. King, (Bayley Opening \nReport at \u00b6\u00b6 44-45; Bayley Reply Report at \u00b6 18; D.I. 226, ex. 55 at 25-26) ; Mr. Bayley did not 51 Now, t here is nothing wrong with a lay witness like Mr. Kintner providing certain \nfoundational facts about the 360- video rig market to a damages expert \u2014so long as those facts \nare drawn from the lay witness\u2019 own personal experience in the field.  An expert could then take \nsuch facts into account in forming his or her opinion on a subject ( as long as the expert was \nqualified to do so).  (D.I. 242 at 20; Tr. at 52) ; Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc., No. C 10-03561 \nWHA, 2011 WL 5914033, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2011) (\u201cE xpert reliance on foundational \nfacts supplied by [lay witnesses]  can be proper so long as they testify to the foundational facts \nwith firsthand knowledge.\u201d); see also ART+COM Innovationpool GmbH v. Google Inc ., 155 F. \nSupp. 3d 489, 510-11 (D. Del. 2016).     \nBut here, Mr. Bayley is not just taking foundational facts obtained from Mr. Kintner and \nusing them to form his own, independent opinion about whether the 21 potential substitutes  (or \nthe 15 purportedly non-infringing potential substitutes) at issue would have been commercially acceptable alternatives .  Mr. Bayley is a damages expert  and he do es not have any stand- alone \nopinion on commercial acceptability.  Instead, he is entirely relying upon Mr. Kintner\u2019s opinion \nin this  regard.   \nAnd this is where Defendant\u2019s objections come into play.  Defendant asserts that Mr. \nBayley\u2019s analysis as to comm ercial acceptab ility is objectionable for two primary reasons.  F irst, \nDefendant argues that if Mr. Bayley wanted to rely on Mr. Kintner\u2019s opinions on the question of \nconduct his own analysis of the market in this regard, (D.I. 226, ex. 55 at 31-32, 41, 75, 99).  Yet \nalthough Dr. King does include opinion in his Opening Report and his Reply Report about \nwhether  certain of the potential substitutes are  commercially acceptable alternatives, ( D.I. 226, \nex. 39 at 141; see also id ., ex. 37 at 2-9), it is clear that on that score, Dr. King was in turn \nwholly relying on the input he received from Mr. Kintner, ( id., ex. 39 at 141; id ., ex. 37 at 2-3; \nTr. at 41, 46-48).   So in the end, the underlying evidence here all derives from Mr. Kintner, not \nDr. King.    52 commercial acceptability, then Plaintiff should have designated Mr. Kintner as an expert witness  \non that score (pursuant to Rule 26(a)(2)(A) ), and should have had him provide a summary of his \nexpected testimony during the expert discovery period (pursuant to Rule 26(a)(2)(C)).  (D.I. 242 \nat 19; see also  D.I. 223 at 39-40)  It asserts this is so because Mr. Kintner\u2019s testimony about \ncommercial acceptability is based on specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702\u2014and is not the type of lay witness opinion testimony permitted by Federal Rule of Evidence 701.  (D.I. 242 at 18-19)  Second, even if Mr. Kintner \u2019s testimony in this regard is not expert \ntestimony, Defendant asserts that Mr. Kintner simply did not have a firm factual foundation on which to base that lay opinion, since Mr. Kintner \u201ctestified that he had not conducted any \nanalysis of the market for 360-video capture devices\u201d nor had he \u201creviewed, relied upon or commissioned anyone else to conduct such an analysis.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 39)   \nThe Court need only address Defendant\u2019s first argument here.   In the Court\u2019s  view , Mr. \nKintner\u2019s opinions\n21 about whether consumers would have considered any of these 21 other \nvideo rig products to be commercially acceptable alternatives to the patented product amounts to the utilization of \u201cother specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702\u201d\u2014such that it \n21It should be noted that the actual bases for Mr. Kintner\u2019s opinions about \nc\nommercial acceptability are not well set out in the record.  In his expert reports, Mr. Bayley \nnever explains why  it is that Mr. Kintner thinks that any of these 21 potential substitutes would \nnot be commercially acceptable al ternatives.  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 45; Bayley Reply \nReport at \u00b6 18)  And so far as the Court is aware, Mr. Kintner never discussed that subject during \na deposition in the case.  Presumably, the reasons behind Mr. Kintner\u2019s conclusions in this regard are the ones set out by Dr. King in his Reply Report (i.e., the portions of that report where Dr. King discusses commercial acceptability of the  potential substitutes ).  (King Reply Report at 2- 9)  \nYet the Court\u2019s point is that there is no other portion of the record where Mr. Kintner himself  \nexplains, on a product-by-product basis, how he  came to these conclusions.  That is problematic, \nsince Mr. Kintner is the source of this information ; Defendant has never had the opportunity to \nsee Mr. Kintner\u2019s analysis set out in one place, nor to depose Mr. Kintner about the substanc e of \nthat analysis.  53 cannot serve as lay opinion testimony pursuant to Rule 701.  Fed. R. Evid. 701.  After all, the \nbuying habits and preferences of purchasers of the se video rigs is not the type of information that \nis within the ken of the average citizen.  And it appears that in order to have a sufficiently deep understanding of this  subject matter , Mr. Kintner would have needed  to do more than simply rely \non his firsthand knowledge of the inner- workings of his own business.  Cf.  Fed. R. Evid. 701 \nadvisory committee\u2019s note to 2000 amendments (noting that a business owner could provide lay opinion testimony as to the value or projected profits of her business, because the business owner would have had personal knowledge of those financial matters by virtue of her own position in that business).  Instead, Mr. Kintner would surely have been required to have surveyed the view points of a broad array of stakeholders in this  advanced technologic al field , so that he could \nspeak with authority on those stakeholders\u2019 wants and needs.  See Minerva Marine, Inc. v. Spiliotes , Civ. No. 02-2517 (WHW), 2006 WL 8457427, at *4-6 (D.N.J. Mar. 13, 2006) \n(concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed lay opinion witness was in fact an expert witness pursuant to Rule 702, where the witness, a port captain, was being offered to provide testimony \u201cbased on his own personal knowledge and experience\u201d about the services provided by a por t \ncaptain, since the testimony required \u201cspecialized knowledge \u201d about subject matter that went \nbeyond events that the witness had \u201cperceived firsthand\u201d) ; cf. (D.I. 226, ex. 56 at 64 (Mr. Kintner \nexplaining that with regard to a market share analysis as to all of the players in the 360 video rig industry, he was aware of \u201csome stuff\u201d that had been produced on that topic, but he had never reviewed or commissioned that type of an analysis )). \nIndeed, in this very case, when offering testimony about whether certain third -party rigs \nwould have been commercially acceptable alternatives in the relevant time period, Defendant did so through an expert (Ryan Thomas), whom it designated as such pursuant to Rule 702.  54 360Heros, Inc. v. GoPro, Inc ., \u2014 F. Supp. 3d. \u2014, 2021 WL 5050879, at *2-3 (D. Del. Nov. 1, \n2021).  Mr. Thomas submitted an expert report, and he was deposed extensively about his \nopinions during expert discovery.  Id . at *1 -3.  And ironically, earlier in this matter , Plaintiff \nactually challenged Mr. Thomas\u2019 testimony on the ground that his knowledge of this subject matter was not specialized enough.  Id .   \nCase law from the patent realm also supports the Court\u2019s conclusion here.  For example, \nin Webasto Thermo & Comfort N. Am. Inc. v. BesTop, Inc ., Case No. 16- cv-13456, 2019 WL \n3334563 (E.D. Mich. July 25, 2019), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan concluded that testimony from the defendant\u2019s damages expert (Mr. Robinson) \nregarding the availability of non- infringing alternatives should be excluded on the ground of \nunreliability .  2019 WL 3334563, at *6-7.  Mr. Robinson\u2019s opinion on this front was based \nentirely on discussions he had with the defendant\u2019s Director of Engineering (Mr. Smith).  Id . at \n*4.  T he Webasto Court concluded that Mr. Robinson could not rely on Mr. Smith for evidence\nregarding non-infringing alternatives.  In doing so, it explained that \u201cany opinion that the proposed design would provide a ll the same benefits of the [patent -in-suit] and would be an \nacceptable alternative to consumers would involve explaining to a jury what consumers valued in the [patent -in-suit] and why and how the alleged proposed alternative design-around satisfied \ncustomer preferences and demands [.]\u201d  Id. at 6.  The Webasto Court noted that Mr. Smith did not \nhave percipient knowledge of this  subject matter , and that this was one reason why his testimony \nat issue could not be relied upon.  Id .  But the Court also explained that even if Mr. Smith  did \nhave such knowledge, he still could not have testified at trial about this subject, since he would \nonly have been able to provide testimony \u201cin the form of lay opinion[.]\u201d  Id .  In other words, \nalthough the Webasto Court did not explicitly state that this type of testimony required 55 \u201cspecialized knowledge\u201d that must be provided by an expert witness pursuant to Rule 702, that is \nclearly the import of what the Court was conveying with its  decision. \nSimilarly, in Good Tech. Corp. v. Mobileiron, Inc ., Case No. 5:12- cv-05826-PSG, 2015 \nWL 4090431 (N.D. Cal. July 5, 2015), the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof California concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s technical expert\u2019s opinions about the commercial acceptability of non-infringing alternatives should be excluded pursuant to Rule 702.  2015 WL 4090431, at *8.  The Good Tech. Court explained that the expert\u2019s \u201cproffered testimony on customer expectations and preferences in the enterprise mobility management market [was] not based in any market research or particular expertise in the area[,] \u201d and that while the expert was \n\u201cmore than qualified technically, experience with the technology does not give an individual expertise in consumer demand related to those non-infringing alternatives.\u201d  Id.   Implicit in the \nGood Tech. Court\u2019s ruling was that \u201cexpertise in consumer demand related to . . . non-infringing alternatives\u201d is the kind of thing that amounts to \u201cspecialized knowledge\u201d about a subject matter that falls within the scope of Rule 702.   \nHere, t here is no dispute that Plaintiff did not de signate Mr. Kintner as an expert witness \npursuant to Rule 26(a)(2)(A) earlier in this  case.  N or did it provide a summary of his expected \ntestimony during the expert discovery period, pursuant to Rule 26(a)(2)(C).  In light of this, the Court treats this p ortion of Defend ant\u2019s Motion as one seeking to strike any such now-proffered \ntestimony as being violative of Rule 26.  It  grants that request.  See Minerva Marine, Inc., 2006 \nWL 8457427, at *6-7 (finding that because a proposed lay witness was in fact promoting expert testimony, and because the witness had not been properly identified as an expert witness, his \ntestimony should be stricken).  In the absence of reliance on such testimony, Mr. Bayley cannot \npoint to evidence that could satisfy this second Panduit  factor .  Therefore , Mr. Bayley\u2019s lost 56 profits methodology is unsound and does not fit the facts of the case; it must be rejected under \nDaubert .     \niii. Third Panduit  Factor\nThe third Panduit  factor relates to whether a patentee can show that it had  the \nmanufacturing and marketing capability to exploit the demand for the patented product.  Past business practices and relationships are probative of the ability to meet demand.  TEK Glob., S.R.L. v. Sealant Sys. Int\u2019l, Inc., 920 F.3d 777, 790 (Fed. Cir. 2019) ; Yarway Corp. v. Eur-\nControl USA, Inc., 775 F.2d 268, 276-77 (Fed. Cir. 1985).   \nIn the relevant section of his Opening Report and Reply Report, Mr. Bayley includes \ninformation on this topic, largely drawn from his discussions with Mr. Kintner.  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6\u00b6 46-49; Bayley Reply Report at \u00b6\u00b6 20- 27)  In  these portions of his reports, \nMr. Bayley largely focuses on manufacturing capabilities, and notes that :  (1) Plaintiff\u2019s video \nrigs were manufactured by different companies during the years in question (including 3DSystems and The Sexton Corporation) ; (2) th ose companies had the capacity to meet any \ngrowth in demand that Plaintiff might have experienced during those years; and (3) Plaintiff had also developed new supply chain routes with Chinese manufacturers and had purchased excess inventory during this time, in order to help it meet any expected demand.  ( Id.)  \nIn asserting that Mr. Bayley  failed to point to s ufficient  evidence as to this factor, \nDefendan t makes three arguments.  (D.I. 223 at 35, 40)  For the reasons set forth below, none of \nthem are availing . \nFirst, Defendant notes that Plaintiff was \u201cengaged in litigation with Manfrotto \u2014the \nexclusive reseller of its products \u2014wherein [Plaintiff]  claimed that Manfrotto failed to meet its \nobligations to properly market 360Heros\u2019 products [in the 2017 to early 2018 time period] .\u201d  57 (D.I. 223 at 35 (citing D.I. 226, ex. 47, at 4-17) )  But whether Plaintiff\u2019s  troubles with its \nmarketing firm would really have caused it to be unable to meet a need for increased demand in \n2017 or early 2018 (and whether Mr. Bayley sufficiently considered those facts in his analysis ) is \na challenge that goes to the weight and cre dibility of his assessment, not its admissibility.  See \nAlarm.com, Inc. v. SecureNet Techs. LLC , No. CV 15-807-RGA, 2019 WL 133228, at *2 (D. \nDel. Jan. 8, 2019) ; Biomedical Enters., Inc. v. Solana Surgical, LLC , CIVIL NO.  A-14- CV-\n0095-LY, 2016 WL 4198304, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 26, 2016).   \nSecond, Defendant argues that \u201cMr. Bayley relies only on [Mr.] Kintner for \n[manufacturing and marketing] information[,] without having engaged in any independent verification through [Plaintiff\u2019s] manufacturers or sub-manufacturers.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 40)  As an initial matter, there is no reason why Mr. Bayley could not rely on Mr. Kintner to provide factual information about Plaintiff\u2019s manufacturing or marketing partnerships.  360Heros is Mr. Kintner\u2019s company, after all, and Mr. Kintner surely would have first-person foundational \nknowledge about that subject  matter .  (Tr. at 24 (Defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledging that Mr. \nKintner could, in fact, provide such testimony))  Nor is i t correct to say that Mr. Bayley  only  \nreferences conversations with Mr. Kintner regarding this subject matter.  For example, in other portions of his reports, Mr. Bayley cites to data suggesting that Plaintiff\u2019s  ability to market its \nproduct to producers of video content grew more robust in the relevant timeframe \u2014evidence Mr. \nBayley offers to suggest that, had it needed to do so, Plaintiff could have successfull y marketed \nits product to the customers that Defendant serviced during these periods.  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6\u00b6 61 -62 (citing data indicating that the number of Plaintiff contacts with such \nproducers rose dramatically between 2015 and 2017) ; see also D.I. 247, ex. C at 57-58; Tr. at 58-\n60)If Defendant thinks Mr. Bayley should have also done additional \u201cverification\u201d of certain of58 these facts by contacting third -party entities, that would be a matter it could follow up on via \ncross -examination.  \nThird, Defendant asserts that \u201ccorrespondence between [Plaintiff] and its manufacturers \nover the years highlights significant shortcomings in manufacturing capacity.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 40; \nsee also id . at 35)  Here, Defendant is referring primarily to two e -mails in the record.  These e-\nmails indicate that in February 2015 and March 2016, respectively, Plaintiff was having difficulties with  one of its rig manufacturers  (3DSystems ), which in turn were causing Plaintiff \nto struggle to meet demand.\n22  Again, these are very helpful documents for Defendant.  They will \nmake for good cross-examination of Mr. Bayley.  But Mr. Bayley\u2019s methodology is not subject to exclusion under Daubert  for unreliab ility just because, in his reports, he does not refer to \nevery  e-mail that Defendant thinks he should.  Nor is it subject to exclusion because there are \nsome documents of record that might be said to contradict his testimony.  See Am. Cruise Lines, Inc. v. HMS Am. Queen Steamboat Co. LLC, No. 13- cv-324 (RGA), 2017 WL 3528606, at *6 \n(D. Del. Aug. 16, 2017) (\u201cDefendant also attempts to challenge [an expert\u2019s] testimony by citing \n22In  one of the e- mails  from February 2015, Mr. Kintner tells a representative of \n3DSystems that he needs the company to \u201cstep up to the plate and start meeting the demands that \nwe are faced with every day\u201d and that while he needs \u201ct o have 50 to 60 units per week if not \nmore\u201d 3DSystems was \u201cpresently providing [him with] 10 to 12.\u201d  (D.I. 226, ex. 58 at 360Heros_DE_01049)  According to Mr. Kintner, this left his team facing \u201ceveryday [] issues of not being able to meet the demand of the productions [;]\u201d he threatened  that if 3DSystems \u201ccan\u2019t \nmeet these demands then I will be forced to source other manufacturing alternatives[.]\u201d  ( Id.)  In \nthe second e- mail, from December 2016, Mr. Kintner complains to a representative of Stratasys \nDirect Manufacturing (or \u201cStratasys,\u201d which apparently  is a related entity to 3DSystems), (D.I. \n237, ex.

This attempt also fails.  Contradiction is proper fodder for cross-\nexamination.\u201d).     \niv. Fourth Panduit  Factor\nThe fourth Panduit factor is \u201ca showing of a reasonable approximation of the patentee\u2019 s \nlost profits.\u201d  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Amoco Chems. Corp., 915 F. Supp. 1333, 1352 (D. Del. 1994).  Defendant  claims that Mr. Bayley\u2019s lost profits calculation under the fourth Panduit  factor  is \nmethodologically unsound for a number of reasons.  The Court need only address two of the primary reasons that Defendant cites .  (Tr. at 29)   \nFirst, Defendant argues that Mr. Bayley \u2019s calculations are not based on actual sales made \nby GoPro, and instead on \u201ca made-up number of forecasted sales\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 35; see also id . at \n40-41)  More specifically, Defendant notes that when Mr. Bayley estimated lost profits in the2016-2020 time period, he did not start his analysis with a focus on the number of sales of accused products that  GoPro  made to its customers  in that timeframe.  Instead, Mr. Bayley:  (1) \nfocus ed on a database of videographers or producers (\u201cproducers\u201d)  that 360Heros  had contacted \nin 2012 through 2015; (2) used data regarding the amount of growth seen in that 360Heros  \nproducer database, along with data about 360Heros\u2019 actual income, in order to project  out what \n360Heros\u2019 \u201cbut- for-total income\u201d should have been during the infringement period; and  (3) t ook \n360Heros\u2019  projected income figures and used them to calculate its  purported lost profits in th e \nyears in question (by reducing those income figures in light of various projected costs and expenses) .  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6\u00b6 58-66; see also  D.I. 226, ex. 55 at 56 -58)  After doing \nthese calculations, Mr. Bayley asserts that Plaintiff\u2019s lost profits for the damages period would have been $9,415,702.  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 66 & Table 7)  This was all methodologically unsound, Defendant argues,  because Mr. Bayley has made no  \u201ccorrelation 60 between [360Heros producer list data or income ] and GoPro\u2019s  actual allegedly infringing sales .\u201d  \n(Tr. at 2 5 (emphasis added) ; see also  D.I. 242 at 22 ( Defendant noting that Mr. Bayley \u201cdoes not \ndescribe how the \u2018producers\u2019 are relevant to sales or present any evidence to show that any of \nthese \u2018producers\u2019 actually purchased accused  products from GoPro or that any of GoPro\u2019s \ncustomer [s] would have purchased 360Heros\u2019 rigs\u201d) )   \nDefendant is correct.  The lost profits calculation is one that typically must have, at its \nfoundation, a focus on the sales of the accused products that the accused infringer actually sold during the relevant damages period.  After all, courts have articulated the goal of the lost profits analysis  as attempting to determine how many of those sales  the patentee would have made \u201cbut \nfor\u201d infringement  (and how much profit the patentee lost as a result of not having made sales of \nits own product to those very same customers ).  See Rite -Hite, 56 F.3d at 1545 (\u201cTo recover lost \nprofits damages, the patentee must show a reasonable probability that, \u2018but for\u2019 infringe ment, it \nwould have made the sales that were made  by the infringer .\u201d) (emphasis added).  But Mr. \nBayley\u2019s analysis was not about correlating Defendant\u2019s actual sales with the amount of lost profit s that Plaintiff should have received.  I nstead, as Plaintiff acknowledges, Mr. Bayley  \n\u201ccorrelated 360Heros [\u2019] actual profits to actual producers contacted[.]\u201d  (D.I. 234 at 45 \n(emphasis added))   This type of analysis contradicts relevant legal precedent on lost profits \ndamages and is thus methodologically unsound.\n23   \n23Plaintiff\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  For example, Plaintiff asserts \nt\nhat Mr. Bayley used a methodology that is little differe nt than the one blessed by the Federal \nCircuit in Versata Software, Inc. v. SAP Am. Inc ., 717 F.3d 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  But as \nDefendant notes, (D.I. 242 at 21- 22), even a cursory review of that case demonstrates that it does \nnot help Plaintiff\u2019s argument\u2014it hurts it.  In Versata , the first step that the plaintiff\u2019s damages \nexpert took in calculating the plaintiff\u2019s lost profits was that he \u201cidentified a pool of potential \ncustomers:  Tier 1 customers who had purchased [the accused infringer] SAP\u2019s softwa re.\u201d  717 \nF.3d at 1266.  And from there, the expert\u2019s goal was to \u201cdetermine[] how many of those 43561 Second, Defendant argues that Mr. Bayley\u2019s calculations are unreliable because he \ncalculates lost profits through 2020, wh ile GoPro stopped selling the allegedly infringing rigs in \n2017.  (D.I. 223 at 35, 40-41; see also  Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 53 & Table 2 (showing that \nDefendant did not sell accused products in 2018, 2019 or 2020); id . at \u00b6 66 & Table 7 (Mr. \nBayley asserting lost profits damages in 2018, 2019 and 2020); Tr. at 27- 28)  Again, the Court \nagrees that  this amounts to the use of an unreliable methodology.   \nIn a lost profits analysis , the patentee cannot argue that in a given year, but for \ninfringement, it would have made the sales that were made by the infringer\u2014if in that very year, \nthe infringer did not make any actual sales .  (Cf. D.I. 234 at 30 (Plaintiff asserting that its lost \nprofit s analysis intends to establish that \u201c\u2018but for\u2019 GoPro\u2019s infringement, it reasonably would \nhave made additional profits enjoyed by GoPro.\u201d) (emphasis added))   And m ore generally , it \nwould certainly be unusual for a patentee to be able to obtain lost profits  damages for a time \ncustomers [who had purchased the accused infringer\u2019s software ] [the plaintiff] would have won \nbut for SAP\u2019s infringement.\u201d  Id.   This is exactly what Mr. Bayley did not do here.  Instead of \nstarting with the number of Defendant\u2019s customers who purchased the accused products in the \ndamages window and attempting to figure out how many of those sales Plaintiff would have won in a \u201cbut for\u201d world, Mr. Bayley started with a focus on the amount of sales Plaintiff actually made in this time period and on how many producers Plaintiff contacted during that period. \nA\ndditionally Plaintiff argue s\u2014citing to paragraph 63 and Table 6 of Mr. Bayley\u2019s \nOpening Report\u2014that Mr. Bayley  did, in fact, \u201cconsider GoPro\u2019s actual sales [.]\u201d  (D.I. 234 at 46 \n(citing Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 6 3 & Table 6))  But this statement is misleading.   In the \nportion of his report at issue, Mr. Bayley is simply saying that the total amount of income from Defendant\u2019s accused product sales in 2016 and 2017 is greater than the total amount of lost profits that Mr. Bayley claims that Plaintiff lost in those years.  Yet the reality is that when it came to calculating what those lo st profits should be, Mr. Bayley did not start with the amount of \naccused product sales that Defendant made in those years , and then work to determine how many \nof those sales Plaintiff would have made (and, relatedly, how much profit Plaintiff would have \nreaped from those sales).  Instead, as can be clearly seen in, inter alia , Table 7 of Mr. Bayley\u2019s \nOpening Report, Mr. Bayley\u2019s starting point in his lost profits analysis wa s the projected  amount \nof total income that he calculates that Plaintiff should have earned in those years.  That is error.   62 period in which its adversary did not make any accused product s ales.  If such a scenario is even \npossible, then surely Plaintiff must at least  put forward evidence specifying the particular (non-\nDefendant) sales that it believes it would have made in this  \u201cbut for\u201d world, explain what entity \nactually made those sales, and s omehow credibly link its failure to make those sales to \nDefendant\u2019s infringing conduct.  Cf. Br ooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc ., 977 F.2d \n1555, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ; Rosco, Inc. v. Mirror Lite Co., 506 F. Supp. 2d 137, 150 (E.D.N.Y. \n2007).  Mr. Bayley does none of that type of analysis here. \nBecause Mr. Bayley has not pointed to reliable evidence that could satisfy the fourth  \nPanduit  factor, this is another reason why his lost profits methodology is unsound and must be \nrejected under Daubert .     \nb. Dr. King\u2019s Lost Profits Opinion s\nWith regard to  its request to exclude portions of Dr. King\u2019s opinions relating to lost \nprofits, GoPro makes two ar guments.  The Court will address them in turn. \nFirst, as was noted above, see supra n.19, Defendant asserts that Dr. King \u201cfailed to \ninclude any analysis of non-infringing alternatives in his opening report\u201d; it argues that Dr. \nKing\u2019s efforts to correct this by explaining in his Reply Report why the potential substitutes do or do not infringe should be \u201cstruck in its entirety for being provided in an untimely manner.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 41-43; D.I. 242 at 15; Tr. at 21-22; see also  King Reply Report at 2-9)  However, \neven assuming that this information was not timely provided, an analysis of the Pennypack factors does not mi litate  in favor of exclusion.\n24   \n24In considering whether to exclude evidence relating to an untimely or otherwise \ni\nmproper disclosure, the Third Circuit has directed district courts to weigh certain factors, known \nas \u201cthe Pennypack  factors \u201d:  (1) the surprise or prejudice to the moving party; (2) the ability of \nthe moving party to cure any such prejudice; (3) the extent to which allowing the testimony 63 To be sure, the first Pennypack factor (regarding \u201csurprise or prejudice\u201d) goes \nDefendant\u2019 s way.  Defendant  was likely surprised to see an  infring ement analysis regarding the \npotential substitutes  show up in Dr. King\u2019s Reply Report (as opposed to his Opening Report).  \nAfter all, Mr. Bayley had cited those same 21 potential substitute products in his  Opening Report \nalong with a notations as to w hether each \u201cInfringes\u201d or were \u201cNon -Infringing[.]\u201d  (Bayley \nOpening Report at \u00b6 45 & Table 1; Tr. at  12, 52-53)  Since Dr. King is the only expert on \nPlaintiff\u2019s side who was actually qualified to provide an opinion on that score , it stand s to reason \nthat Defend ant would have expected Dr. King to also address this s ame s ubject matter in his \nOpening Report.  (Tr. at 12, 54-55)  And Dr. King\u2019s failure to do so may have caused Defendant \nsome prejudice, since \u201chad [ Defendant ] had [access to] that information starting in [Dr. King\u2019s] \nopening report,\u201d then it would have been able to address that  analysis in its own expert\u2019s rebuttal \nreport.   (Tr. 21)   \nBut the remainder of the Pennypack  factors go Plaintiff\u2019s way.  For example, as to the \nsecond factor (regarding the ability to cure any prejudice) and third factor  (regarding the impact \nof any cure on trial), a cure before trial is surely possible.  Defendant has had Dr. King\u2019s \nopinions now for many months, and  it has  had the opportunity to depose him on this subject \nmatter.  Moreover, Defendant\u2019s own expert would surely be given the opportunity to address Dr. \nwould disrupt the order and efficiency of trial; (4) bad faith or willfulness in fa iling to comply; \nand (5) the importance of the testimony sought to be excluded.  See Meyers v.  Pennypack Woods \nHome Ownership Ass\u2019n, 559 F.2d 894, 904-05 (3d Cir. 1977) ; see also  Konstantopoulos v. \nWestvaco Corp., 112 F.3d 710, 719 (3d Cir. 1997) .  Because \u201c[t]he exclusion of critical evidence \nis an extreme sanction,\u201d the Third Circuit has explained that it should be reserved for \ncircumstances amounting to \u201cwillful deception or flagrant disregard of a court order by the proponent of the evidence.\u201d  Paoli , 35 F.3d at 791-92 (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  64 King\u2019s opinions at the October 2022 trial.  And if Defendant feels the need to have its expert \nserve a pre -trial supplemental report ( limited to th is content) , there is certainly time before trial \nfor it to seek the District Judge\u2019s permission to do so.  (Tr. at 21)  As to  the fourth \u201cbad faith or \nwillfulness\u201d factor, the Court sees no evidence of bad faith here.   And with regard to the fifth \n\u201cimportance of the testimony\u201d factor, Dr. King\u2019s opinions on this front are certainly very \nimportant to Plaintiff\u2019s ability to make a lost profits argument.  Even Defendant conceded as much in its briefing.  (D.I. 223 at 43 (Defendant allowing that \u201cDr. King\u2019s belated opinions are extremely important to the damages calculation in this case\u201d  and could \u201cmean the difference \nbetween possible liability and no liability for lost profits in this case\u201d ); see also  Tr. at 21 -22)  In \nsum, Dr. King\u2019s opinions in his Reply Report about whether any of the potential alternatives are infringing or non-infringing should not be stricken (even if they were untimely). \nSecond, Defendant asserts that Dr. King\u2019s opinions on the commercial acceptability of \nthe potential substitutes should be excluded, in that they are outside the scope of Dr. King\u2019s  \nexpertise and are unreliable.  (D.I. 223 at 43-45; see also  King Opening Report at 141; King \nReply Report at 2- 9)  For the same reasons as were discussed above in Section  II.B.2.a.ii., the \nCourt agrees that :  (1) Dr. King\u2019s opinions in this regard are wholly reliant on Mr. Kintner\u2019s \ninput ; and (2) because Mr. Kintner was not properly offered as an expert witness on this subject, \nDr. King\u2019s opinions on the subject should be excluded.  (D.I. 234 at 47-48; D.I. 242 at 15-16, 18-21)    \n3. Reasonable Royalty\nLastly, Defendant challenges Mr. Bayley\u2019s reasonable royalty analysis.  (D.I. 223 at 45-\n49; D.I. 242 at 24-25; Def endant\u2019s Hearing Presentation, Slide 11)  The Court begins by setting \nout the relevant legal standards  relating to such an analysis. 65 Damages in a patent infringement action may be awarded based on a \u201creasonable \nroyalty\u201d for use of the patented invention.  See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284.  This requires that a royalty rate \nand a royalty base be assessed.  A reasonable royalty \u201cseeks to compensate the patentee not for lost sales caused by the infringement, but for its lost opportunity to obtain a reasonable royalty that the infringer would have been willing to pay if it had been barred from infringing.\u201d  AstraZeneca AB v. Apotex Corp., 782 F.3d 1324, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  \u201cA patentee is only \nentitled to a reasonable royalty attributable to the infringing features\u201d and therefore \u201c[t]he patentee \u2018must in every case give evidence tending to separate or apporti on the defendant\u2019s \nprofits and the patentee\u2019s damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features.\u2019\u201d  Power Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int\u2019l, Inc., 904 F.3d 965, 977 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Garretson v. Clark , 111 U.S. 120, 121 (1884)); see also  Elbit Sys. Land & C4I \nLtd. v. Hughes Network Sys., LLC , 927 F.3d 1292, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\u201c[T]he apportionment \nrequirement [dictates] that a royalty should reflect the value of patented technology.\u201d); Ericsson , \nInc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\u201cAs a substantive matter, it is the \u2018value of what was taken\u2019 that measures a \u2018reasonable royalty\u2019 under [Section] 284.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  This means that whe n it comes to ass essing the damages \nbase in a case where only certain elements of a multi-component product are accused of infringement, it is generally required that royalties be based \u201cnot on the entire product, but instead on the \u2018smallest salable patent -practicing unit.\u2019\u201d  LaserDynamics, Inc. v. Quanta \nComput., Inc., 694 F.3d 51, 67 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citation omitted) .   \nA narrow exception to the general rule requiring apportionment is the entire market value \nrule.  Id.  The entire market value rule \u201cpermits recovery of damages based on the value of a \npatentee\u2019s entire apparatus containing several features when the patent [-]related feature is the 66 basis for customer demand.\u201d  Rite -Hite, 56 F.3d at 1549 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted)  (applying the entire market value rule to lost profits damages analysis ); see also \nLaserDynamics , 694 F.3d at 67 (\u201cIn effect, the entire market value rule acts as a check to ensure \nthat [reasonable] royalty damages being sought under [Section] 284 are in fact \u2018reasonable\u2019 in \nlight of the technology at issue.\u201d).  In order to satisfy the entire market value rule, a patentee must \u201cpresent evidence showing that the [patented feature] drove demand for the [entire apparatus][;] [i]t is not enough to merely show that the [patented feature] is viewed as valuable, important, or even essential to the use of the [entire apparatus].\u201d  Id. at 68.    \nDefendant argues that  Mr. Bayley \u2019s reasonable royalty opinions are defective for two \nmain reasons.  (D.I. 223 at 45-49)  The Court will address these in turn.   \na. Apportionment and the Entire Market Value Rule\nFirst, Defendant asserts that Mr. Bayley failed to properly assess the royalty base by not \nidentifying the smallest salable patent- practicing unit ( or \u201cSSPPU\u201d), and that he erroneously \napplied the entire market value rule.  (D.I. 223 at 45-47)  To that end, when identifying the appropriate royalty base , Mr. Bayley  utilized worldwide gross revenue (dating from October 6, \n2015 through the expected date of trial), for the accused video rigs\u2014as well as for cameras and software that are sold in conjunction with those rigs.  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 121 & Table 16; D.I. 223 at 46)  He then applied a 4.4% royalty rate to this base, resulting in a proffered reasonable royalty of .  ( Id.)  Defendant argues that not only was it wrong for Mr. \nBayley to use total revenue for the accused video rigs as a base without any further apportionment, but it was doubly wrong to include revenues relating to Defendant\u2019s \u201ccameras and software sold with Accused Products [, in light of] the [] fact that the '019 patent does not \ncover cameras or software.\u201d  (D.I. 223 at 46-47)   \n67 With regard to the fact that Mr. Bayley utilized all of the sales revenue for  each accused \nvideo rig in his royalty base (as opposed to attempting to apportion by identifying a SSPPU that \namounts to something less than the entire rig), Plaintiff responds by stating that \u201cMr. Bayley\u2019s report provides that he ascribed 100% of the value of the infringing sales to the claims of the patent for each of the accused devices [,] as there were no improvements added by GoPro that \nresults in incremental benefit to users of the accused devices in calculating the royalty base.\u201d  (D.I. 234 at 48)  That may be so, but the Court cannot identify the portion of Mr. Bayley\u2019s reports in which he actually states this conclusion and explains the reasons behind it.  There is \none sentence in  his opening report where Mr. Bayley flatly asserts  \u201cI am not aware of any \nadditional features or improvements added by GoPro that resulted in an incremental benefit to the Omni, Abyss, and Odyssey users.\u201d  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 111; see also  D.I. 234 at 48)  \nYet as was noted above, in order to utilize the entire market value rule, Plaintiff must present  at \nleast some evidence showing that the patented features (here, certain claimed sub-components of \na video rig) drive demand for the entire rig.  Mr. Bayley does not marshal any actual facts  nor \nengage in any real analysis when attempting to make this showing.  Thus, his analysis on this point is  unreliable and does not fit the facts of the case.   \nAs for the fact that Mr. Bayley included camera sales revenue in his royalty base, \nPlaintiff asserts that this was appropriate, because although \u201cclaims 1-29 [of the '019 patent] do not claim a camera as a separate element\u201d when it comes to asserted independent claim 30,  \u201ca \ncamera is included as a claim element [.]\u201d  (D.I. 234 at 48 (emphasis added);  see also id . at 49)\n25  \n25I n making this argument in its briefing, Plaintiff cites  for support to a declaration \nsubmitted by Dr. King.  Defendant moved to strike this declaration as untimely, (D.I. 252), a \nmotion that the Court has denied, (D.I. 266).  That said, in his declaration, Mr. King makes no \nreal, non-conclusory argument as to why  the apparatus in claim 30 necessarily includes a camera.  68 However, as a matter of claim construction, the Court disagrees that claim 30 (and its dependent \nclaims) include such a camera element.  It does so for the following reasons: \n\u2022Claim 30 is an apparatus claim.  And more specifically, it is a\nclaim to a \u201cholding fixture\u201d with particular required sub-components.  ('019 patent, col. 24:23-40)  A \u201cholding fixture\u201dis not a camera.\n\u2022T\nhe holding fixture in claim 30 is one said to be \u201cconfigured to\nretain a plurality of photographic cameras  in a predetermined\norientation, the holding fixture comprising[. . .]\u201d  ( Id., col.\n24:23-25)  This further makes clear that what follows in theclaim is a description about how the holding fixture  is\nconfigur ed so that, when it is manufactured , it can hold\nmultiple cameras  in a certain configuration.  It would not make\nsense for an apparatus claim worded this way to include acamera itself  as a limitation .  Instead, it makes sense that what\nis further described are attributes of the claimed rig ( a rig t hat,\nin turn, can be used to hold cameras).\n\u2022C\nlaim 30 describes how the holding fixture includes a\n\u201cplurality of receptacles [.]\u201d  (Id ., col. 24:29)  It further states\nthat \u201ceach of the receptacles defining an open -end[ed]\nenclosure sized for retaining a photographic camera and inwhich the receptacles are oriented about the support such thateach retained photographic camera provides an overlappingfield of view, the cameras being disposed such that a centerlineof the lens barrel of each retained camera is configured tointersect [in a certain manner].\u201d  ( Id., col. 24:31- 40)  There is\nno question that this language is clunky.  But in the Court\u2019sview, what is being described here is the required structure andorientation  of the receptacles , nothing more.  (D.I. 242 at 25;\nTr. at 30)  To be sure, the contours of that requiredstructure /orientation  are described by reference to how cameras\nmust be disposed when they are placed into the receptacles , as\nwell as to the viewpoint of such cameras .  (Id. at 31)  But the\nclaim do es not require t hat a camera actually be inserted into a\n(D.I. 237, ex. K at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11; see also  D.I. 242 at 24 (Defendant noting that in his declaration, Dr. \nKing \u201cfails to explain where or how claims 30 to 37 recite a camera as a separate element , let \nalone why claims 1 to 29 supposedly do not.\u201d) )  He just says that it does.  So his declaration is \nnot helpful in this regard.  As the Court has noted, (D.I. 266), a decision on whether claim 30 does encompass a camera will be based  on an analysis of the relevant claim language.   69 receptacle for infringement to occur.  Instead, by the claim\u2019s \nown language, infringement occurs once a holding fixture (containing the required receptacles, and other features) is \nmade, used, offered for sale, or sold. \n\u2022E\nven Plaintiff acknowledges that claim 1 , which is also to an\napparatus (a \u201cholding assembly\u201d), does not require a camera.(D.I. 234 at 49; D.I. 237, ex. K at \u00b6 12 ; '019 patent, col. 22:24-\n41)Claim 1 similarly describes how certain receptacles are\nstructured  and oriented .  In doing so, like claim 30 , claim 1\nnotes the required orientation of the receptacles by makingreference to  the disposition and viewpoi nt of cameras that can\nbe placed into those receptacles.  ( '019 patent, col. 22:34-41)\nThus, c laim 1 is little different from claim 30 in this respect.\n26\nA\nnd so it makes little sense that claim 1 would not require a\ncamera as an element while claim 30  would.  (Tr. at 30, 66-68)\nI\nn light of this conclusion, Mr. Bayley\u2019s inclusion of camera revenue as part of his royalty base \namounts to the use of an unreliable methodology that does not fit the facts of t he case.   \nb. Consideration of Certain Licenses\nSecond, Defendant argues that Mr. Bayley \u2019s opinions should be excluded because he \nrelies on 10 purportedly comparable licenses in order to help him determine what a reasonable \nroyalty rate would be.  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 82 & Table 9 ; Bayley Reply Report at \u00b6 \n40)27  Defendant argues that this amounts to an unreliable methodology, since Mr. Bayley did no\nanalysis in order to establish that the licenses are, in fact, comparable.  (D.I. 223 at 47; Tr. 33-34)  \n26During oral argument, Plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggested that a material difference \nb\netween the two claims is that claim 1 claims receptacles that have a latching feature \u201cfor \nenabling a photographic camera to be releasably retained[,]\u201d ( '019 patent, col. 22:34-35), while \nclaim 30 claims receptacles that have an enclosure \u201csized for retaining a photographic camera[,]\u201d \n('019 patent, col. 24:31-32).  (Tr. at 68 -69)  But in the Court\u2019s view, this difference in claim \nlanguage does not make a difference.  In both cases, the respective claims are referencing \ncharacteristics of the receptacles themselves , and how they are configured or sized.   \n27M ore specifically, i n his reports Mr. Bayley explains why he believes that an \nappropriate royalty rate would be 4.4%\u2014the same rate established in a separate license agreement for the '019 patent that Plaintiff entered into with Yi Technologies, Inc. (\u201cYi\u201d).  70 There must be a basis in fact to associate the royalty rates used in prior licenses to the \nparticular hypothetical negotiation at issue, see Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 632 F.3d \n1292, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2011), and comparison of past patent licenses to the infringement must account for the technological and economic differences between them, see Wordtech Sys., Inc. v. Integrated Network Sols., Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  The testimony of a damages expert who relies on non-comparable licenses in reaching his royalty rate should be excluded.  DataQuill Ltd. v. High Tech Comp. Corp., 887 F. Supp. 2d 999, 1022 (S.D. Cal. 2011).   \nThe Court agrees that Mr. Bayley\u2019s testimony about these 10 licenses does not pass \nDaubert  muster .  This is because in order to be relevant to this case, as noted above, the licenses \nneed to be technologically comparable to the asserted claims /infringement.  Yet Mr. Bayley is \nnot qualified to opine on whether the li censes are technologically comparable.  And the one \nexpert on Plaintiff\u2019s side who is qualified to do so (Dr. King) was never shown these licenses and never commented on them.  (D.I. 223 at 48; D.I. 226, ex. 55 at 80-81)  Without a technical expert providing the necessary linkage here as to technological comparability, Mr. Bayley cannot show that the 10 licenses are relevant to the case.  See Spring Commc\u2019ns Co., L.P. v. Mediacom \nCommc\u2019ns Corp., Civil Action No. 17-1736- RGA, 2021 WL 982734, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 16, \n2021) ; GREE, Inc. v. Supercell Oy , Case No. 2:19- cv-00070- JRG-RSP, Case No. 2:19- cv-00071-\nJRG-RSP, 2020 WL 4057640, at *6 (E.D. Tex. July 20, 2020) ; Odyssey Wireless, Inc. v. Apple \n(Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6\u00b6 73, 78)  Mr. Bayley  then notes that the 10 other licenses at issue \nhere \u201cprovide for a royalty that ranges from 0.5% to 5.0%.\u201d  (Bayley Opening Report at \u00b6 84)  \nAnd Mr. Bayley goes on to use the royalty rate range provided by the se 10 licenses as a kind of a \ncheck on the reasonableness of the 4.4% rate drawn from the Yi license\u2014noting that the \u201c4.4% royalty rate compares well with the royalties identified in the\u201d 10 licenses.  ( Id. at \u00b6 74; see also  \nD.I. 226, ex. 55 at 83)71 Inc., Case No.: 15- cv-01735-H- RBB, Case No. 15 -cv-1738-H-RBB, Case No. 15- cv-1743-H-\nRBB, 2016 WL 7644790, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2016). \n4. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set out above, the Court ORDERS  that GoPro\u2019s Daubert  Motions be \nGRANTED- IN-PART  and DENIED -IN-PART .  More specifically, the Court ORDERS that the \nDaubert  Motions should be GRANTED in the following respects: \n\u2022Mr. Bayley\u2019s and Dr. King\u2019s opinions on the commercial\nacceptability of potential non-infringing substitutes should beexcluded.  In light of that, Plaintiff does not have sufficientevidence to meet it s burden as to the second Panduit  factor.\nAnd Mr. Bayley\u2019s opinions setting out a reasonableapproximation of the patentee\u2019s lost profits should be excludedon multiple grounds.  This means that Plaintiff also does nothave sufficient evidence to meet its  burden as to the fourth\nPanduit  factor.\n\u2022M\nr. Bayley\u2019s opinions regarding what is the appropriate\nroyalty base and about the 10 purportedly comparable licensesreferenced above should be excluded.\nT\nhe Court ORDERS that the Daubert  Motions be DENIED in all other respects. \nTo the extent that the portions of the Court\u2019s  orders here that  grant aspects of the Daubert  \nMotions go unchallenged or are affirmed by the District Judge, then this  will then leave open the \nquestion of whether Plaintiff should be given the chance to serve supplemental expert reports in \norder to try to remedy  these deficiencies .  The outcome of that decision, in turn, may inform \nwhether Plaintiff\u2019s claims for lost profits or reasonable roya lty damages should be entirely \ndismissed (as Defendant seeks).  (D.I. 223 at 32, 45)  The Court defers to the District Judge\u2019s judgment as to whether any such supplementation should be permitted prior to trial.    III. CONCLUSION72 For the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that GoPro\u2019s MSJ be GRANTED- IN-\nPART and DENIED -IN-PART, as set out above.  It also orders that GoPro\u2019s Daubert motions be \nGRANTED- IN-PART  and DENIED -IN-PART , as set out above.   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
