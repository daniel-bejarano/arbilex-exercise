No. 20-994-LPS\nKENT COUNTY LEVY COURT AND\nDEPARTMENT OF PLANNING\nSERVICES, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nEShed Alston and Pamela Alston, Dover, Delaware, Pro Se Plaintiffs.\n\nScott G. Wilcox, Esquire, Moore & Rutt, PA, Wilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Defendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nA, Circuit Judge:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiffs EShed Alston and Pamela Alston (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), who proceed pro se, commenced\nthis action on July 27, 2020. (D.I. 1) Before the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and\nPlaintiffs\u2019 request for immediate stay of proceedings. (D.I. 13, 31)\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Complaint alleges Defendants violated the First, Fourth Fifth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, as well as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986 and\n1988, and numerous state and federal criminal statutes. (D.I. 1, 3, 4) Named defendants include the\nKent County Levy Court and Department of Planning Services (\u201cKent County\u201d), Kent County Levy\nCourt President Brooks Banta (\u201cBanta\u201d), Sarah Keifer AICP (Keifer\u201d), Chief Code Administrator\nScott Tanner (\u201cTanner\u201d), and Code Enforcement Constable Robert Silvagni (\u201cSilvagni\u201d) (together,\n\u201cKent County Defendants\u201d).\n\nWhile difficult to discern, it appears Plaintiffs filed this action in response to an inspection of\ntheir property by Silvagni, who found several Kent County ordinance violations. (See D.I. 1-1 at 5-6)\nThe inspection notice, dated July 16, 2020, advised Plaintiffs that the \u201cviolations must be corrected\nimmediately\u201d and provided deadlines for doing so. (Id.) The notice warned Plaintiffs that \u201cfailure to\ncomply with Kent Count requirements promptly will result in legal action by this Department.\u201d (Id)\nPlaintiffs commenced this action on July 27, 2020. They seek $42 million dollars in compensatory\ndamages.\n\nDefendants seek dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state\nclaims upon which relief can be granted. (D.I. 13) Plaintiffs oppose. Plaintiffs also move for\n\nimmediate stay of two proceedings apparently filed in this court. (D.I. 31)\nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the\nCourt to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill \u00bb. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223\n(3d Cir. 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is\nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410,\n1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a motion to\ndismiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them\nin the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d Mato v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d\n472, 481-82 3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. See Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Ath Corp. \u00bb. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A plaintiff\nmust plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of\nShelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect statements of\nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id at 10. \u201cIn evaluating a motion to dismiss,\u201d the\ncourt \u201cmay consider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint . . . matters\nincorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, matters of public\nrecord, orders, [and] items appearing in the record of the case.\u201d Back v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist., 452\nF.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018raise a right to telief\nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if\ndoubtful in fact).\u201d\u201d Victaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550\nUSS. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\n\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d\n2\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. At bottom, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff's claim.\nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nThe Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions,\u201d Morse \u00bb. Lower Merion Sch. Dist.,\n132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201cunsupported conclusions and\nunwarranted inferences,\u201d Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Power \u00a2\u00bb Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,\n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \u201cself-evidently false,\u201d Nami v. Fanver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 3d\nCir. 1996). Because Plaintiffs proceed pro se, their pleading is liberally construed and their\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal\npleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Criminal Charges\n\nThe Comphint mostly alleges violations of state and federal criminal statutes. (D.I. 1 at 1, 2,\n4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13) To the extent Plaintiffs seek to impose criminal liability on Defendants, they\nlack standing to proceed. See Allen v. Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, 270 F. App\u2019x 149, 150\n(3d Cir. 2008); United States v. Friedland, 83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996) (\u201c[T]he United States\nAttorney is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases within his or her district.\u201d). The\ndecision of whether to prosecute, and what criminal charges to bring, generally rests with the\nprosecutor. See United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124 (1979). Accordingly, the motion to\n\ndismiss these claims will be granted.\nB. Deficient Pleadings\n\nThe Complaint also alleges \u201cunconstitutional misconduct in circumvention of the First,\nFourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments,\u201d race discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, and violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988. (D.I. 1 at 1, 2, 3, 10, 12,\n14) A complaint will not suffice if it \u201coffers [merely] \u2018labels and conclusions\u201d or \u201c\u201c\u2018naked\nassertion[s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual enhancement.\u201d Igbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550\nUSS. at 555, 557). Merely reciting an element of a cause of action or making a bare conclusory\nstatement is insufficient to state a claim. See Igbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims are deficiently pled. For example the Complaint does not allege\ndiscrimination based on a contract or a property transaction, as required to state a claim under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The Complaint makes passing references to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988\nwithout adequately alleging how Defendants violated the statutes. Because the foregoing claims do\nnot meet the pleading requirements of Igbal and Twombly, the Court will grant Moving Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss these claim. While it appears unlikely that Plaintiffs will be able to cure the\npleading defects, they will be given leave to amend the claims they attempted to raise under 42\nUSS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1985, 1986, and 1988.\n\nFinally, the Court will deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an immediate stay. (D.I. 31) Plaintiffs\nrefer to a medical emergency, but do not identify it. They wish to stop the judicial proceedings\nwithout a real explanation. Therefore, the motion will be denied.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 13);\n\n(2) give Plaintiffs leave to amend claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988; and\n\n(3) deny Plaintiffs motion for immediate stay (D.I. 31). An appropriate order will be entered.\n4\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nESHED ALSTON and PAMELA ALSTON, :\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civ. No. 20-994-LPS\nKENT COUNTY LEVY COURT AND\nDEPARTMENT OF PLANNING\nSERVICES, et al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\nAt Wilmington this 28th day of March, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum Opinion\nissued this date, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1: Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is GRANTED. (D.I. 13)\n2. Plaintiffs are given leave to amend the claims raised under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983,\n1985, 1986, and 1988 on or before May 6, 2022. The case will be dismissed should Plaintiffs fail to\n\ntimely amend the claims.\n\n3: Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for immediate stay is DENIED. (D.I. 31).\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n"}
