(D.I. \n43; see also  D.I. 46)   Defendant United States Department of Justice (\u201cDefendant\u201d) opposes the \nMotion.  For the reasons that follow, the Court  GRANTS -IN-PART and DENIES -IN-PART the \nMotion in the manner set out below.    \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background  \nNear the end of World War II, U.S. servicemen stationed in occupied Germany stole \njewels belonging to the Royal Family of Hesse  (the \u201cjewels\u201d or the \u201cHesse jewels\u201d).   (D.I. 43, \nex. C at  \u00b6 3)  Federal, state and local American officials made efforts to recover those jewels \nthereafter, but they were not fully successful in doing so.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 3 -4) \nOn September 1, 1961, a plane departing from Malmstrom Air Force Base i n Montana \ncrashed in the western part of that state .  (D.I. 43 at 1; id ., ex. C at \u00b6 5)  The  airplane was \nsearched after the crash; in it were remnants of the Hesse jewels, which were recovered by the \nU.S. government.  (D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 5)     2 \n Plaintiff  is an investigative journalist and a published author whose career spans over 29 \nyears .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 1 -2)  On approximately October 25, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Freedom of \nInformation Act (\u201c FOIA \u201d) request with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) for, inter \nalia, records relating to the investigation of the theft of the Hesse jewels.  (D.I. 45, ex. A at 6- 12, \n17)1  Plaintiff planned to write a book using the requested information; the book was to be about \nthe theft of the jewels, the U.S. government\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to recover the jewels, the \npossible laundering of the jewels on the black market  and the Montana plane crash .  (D.I. 43, ex. \nC at \u00b6 6)   \nIn November 2017, the FBI notified Plaintiff that his FOIA request relating to the Hesse \njewels had been designated as FOIPA Request No. 1388114- 000 (the \u201coriginal FOIA request\u201d) , \nand that a search for related documents had  yielded \u201capproximately 7,250 pages of records \npotentially responsive to the subject of [ his] reques t.\u201d  (D.I. 43, ex. I)  In a later phone \nconversation with Plaintiff and in subsequent e -mails, an FBI FOIA representative explained that \nin light of the amount of potentially responsive records at issue regarding Plaintiff\u2019s \u201clarge  track\u201d \nrequest , and in l ight of the FBI\u2019s  \u201ccurrent workload and staffing levels ,\u201d there could be over a \ntwo-year delay before Plaintiff would receive any records.   (D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 \u00b6 11-12; D.I. 45, \nex. A at 25)  The FBI further stated that it would complete a review of all relevant files before \nreleasing them to Plaintiff, rather than releasing documents  on a piecemeal basis.  (D.I. 43, ex. C \nat \u00b6 13)   \nThe FBI FOIA representative told P laintiff that he \u201cmay accelerate the processing and \nallow for a more timely receipt of the information\u201d by breaking up his request into multiple \n \n1  With regard to citations to D.I. 45, ex. A, the Court will cite to ECF -generated \npage numbers found at the top of the document.  3 \n requests  of no more than 950 pages of records each.  ( D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 14; D.I. 45, ex. A at 25)  \nThis would mean that the FBI would consider each 950- page block as a \u201cmedium  track\u201d request  \n(not a \u201clarge track\u201d request) , which would in turn purportedly speed up the processing time .  \n(D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 \u00b6 14-15)  That said, the \u201ccatch\u201d was that if Plaintiff chose this type of review \nprocess, it would mean that the FBI would only address one 950- page block at a time (such that \nonly when review of one block was completed could another begin) .  (Id.)  The FBI FOIA \nrepresen tative also informed Plaintiff that \u201c\u2018 [i]t may take a couple of months to get assigned\u2019 \u201d \nfor medium track review.  ( Id. at \u00b6 16)  Plaintiff agreed to this type of medium  track review  \nprocess.  ( Id. at \u00b6  17)    \nThereafter, Plaintiff would periodically check the status of his request on the FBI\u2019s FOIA \nstatus website, in order to see whether his request had been assigned for medium  track \nprocessing.  ( Id. at \u00b6 19)  However, t he status of Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request continued to be listed \nas \u201cawaits assignment [.]\u201d  (Id.)  And the FBI FOIA r epresentative had now stopped re sponding \nto Plaintiff\u2019s e -mail queries about the request.  ( Id.)   \nIn February 2018, a different FBI FOIA representative told Plaintiff that his  request was \nstill \u201c\u2018 waiting to  be assigned [,]\u2019\u201d but that th e request should be delivered in its entirety by \nNovember 2018.  ( Id. at \u00b6 20; D.I. 45, ex. A at 26)  By May 2018, the request  still remained \nunassigned and the estimated date of completion was pushed back to December 2018.  (D.I. 45, \nex. A at 26- 27; see also  D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6\u00b6 25 -28)  Thereafter, Plaintiff retained counsel and \ninstituted the instant suit, which is further described below . \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn July 3, 2018, Plaintiff filed this suit pursuant to FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552; his Complaint \nsought injunctive relief , the disclosure of the requested records  and a grant of attorney\u2019s fees  and 4 \n costs .  (D.I. 1)  On July 11, 2018, the case was referred to the Court for handling through case -\ndispositive motions; later, on September 5, 2018, the parties consented to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nto conduct all proceedings in the case, (D.I. 8).   \nOn August 23, 2018, the parties advised the Court that Defendant had agreed to begin \nprocessing Plaintiff\u2019s requested records on a monthly basis, and that the parties were requesting that the case be stayed to permit this processing of records to continue.  (D.I. 7)  Thereafter, t he \nparties jointly sought to continue the stay a number of times , so that :  (1) Defendant could focus \nits efforts on producing records to Plaintiff ; or (2) the parties could attempt to resolve disputes \nover certain proposed redactions to the produced docum ents; or (3) the parties could deal with \ndelays exacerbated by the COVID -19 crisis .  (D.I. 10; D.I. 11; D.I. 14; D.I. 16; D.I. 18; D.I. 20; \nD.I. 22)  The first batch of processed records was released in October 2018, and eventually the \nFBI produced 5,297 pages of documents t o Plaintiff in response to his original Complaint.  ( D.I. \n7; D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 32)   These documents were produced on a rolling basis, in batches of \napproximately 500 pages per month.  ( D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 31)  \nOn August 3, 2020, the stay of the case was lifted, (D.I. 23), and on August 14, 2020, \nPlaintiff filed a  Supplemental C omplaint , (D.I. 26) .  The Supplemental  Complaint included three \nnew FOIA claims that related, respectively, to three additional FOIA requ ests that Plaintiff had \nmade in the past regarding the Hesse jewels or other matters ( FOIPA Request Nos. 1442999- 000, \n1454046- 000 and 1388088- 000) (the \u201cadditional FOIA requests\u201d) .  (D.I. 26 at \u00b6\u00b6 13- 24)  \nThereafter, Defendant agreed to begin processing records related to the se additional FOIA \nrequests , and so the parties agreed to an additional stay of the case  to give Defendant time to \ncomply.  (D.I. 30; D.I. 32 )   An additional 2,482 pages of documents were thereafter produced to \nPlaintiff by the FBI in response to the Supplemental  Complaint.  (D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 32)   These 5 \n documents were also produced on a rolling basis, in batches of approximately 500 pages per \nmonth.  ( Id. at \u00b6 31)2 \nOnce all documents were produced, the parties sought and obtained a further stay of the \ncase to permit them to negotiate a resolution over the issue of attorney\u2019s fees  and costs.  (D.I. 34; \nD.I. 36; D.I. 38; D.I. 40)   When it became clear that the parties could not come to an agreement \nas to th at issue, the stay was lifted, and a briefing schedule was set.   (D.I. 42)  \nOn December 14, 2021, Plaintiff filed the instant M otion.  (D.I. 43)   Briefing was \ncompleted as of February 22, 2022.  (D.I. 46)  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nWith its Motion, Plaintiff seeks an award of $ 60,732.84 in attorney\u2019s fees  and costs , \nrelating to the work of his attorneys at Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP (\u201cTroutman \nPepper\u201d) and Goldstein Law Partners, LLC  (\u201cGoldstein Law Partners\u201d) .  (D.I. 46 at  10)3  Below, \nthe Court will first address the relevant legal standards relating to the Motion; thereafter , it will \naddress the parties\u2019 arguments on the merits. \nA. Legal Standards  \nPursuant to the FOIA, a \u201ccourt may assess against the United States reasonable attorney  \nfees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any [FOIA case] in which the complainant  \n \n2  Eventually, Plaintiff completed a draft of his book regarding the theft of the Hesse \njewels ; he used materials obtained purs uant to this litigation to inform his research for the draft .  \n(D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6\u00b6 3- 8)  Plaintiff  plans to publish the book with a trade press publisher in the \nfuture.  ( Id. at \u00b6 8)  \n \n3  This amount  includes a request for litigation costs of $509.56; the remainder of \nthe amount is for attorney\u2019s fees.  (D.I. 43 at 19; id ., ex. B)   Since the request at issue is \npredominantly for attorney\u2019s fees, at times below the Court may refer to it in shorthand as  an \n\u201cattorney\u2019s fees request\u201d or a \u201crequest for attorney\u2019s fees\u201d or the like.  But it should be \nunderstood that the request also seeks reimbursement of these costs too.  6 \n has substantially prevailed.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i).4  This statutory language divides the \nattorney\u2019s fees  inquiry into two prongs, described as fee \u201celigibility\u201d and fee \u201centitlement.\u201d  \nBrayton v. Office of the U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2011) ; Matlack, Inc. v. \nU.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency , 868 F. Supp. 627, 630 (D. Del. 1994).    \nThe eligibility prong asks whether a plaintiff has \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d and thus \n\u201cmay\u201d receive fees.  Brayton , 641 F.3d at  524 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); \nsee also  Matlack. , 868 F. Supp. at  630.  Here, this prong is not at issue, as Defendant does not \ndispute Plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for a fee award.  (D.I. 45 at 1, 6- 7; D.I. 46 at 2)   \nIf a plaintiff is eligible to receive fees, then the court proceeds to the entitlement prong , \nwhereby it conside rs a variety of factors in order to determine whether the plaintiff should \nreceive fees.  Brayton, 641 F.3d at  524;  Matlack , 868 F. Supp. at  630.  The determination of a \nplaintiff\u2019s entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees  is guided by the Court\u2019s analysis of four non- exhaustive \nfactors:  (1) the public benefit derived from the case; (2) the commercial benefit to the plaintiff; \n(3) the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the records sought; and (4) whether the government\u2019 s \nwithholding had a reasonable basis in law.  McKinley v. F ed. Hous. Fin. Agency , 739 F.3d 707, \n711 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Matlack , 868 F. Supp. at 630.  No one single factor is dispositive.  Davy v. \nC.I.A ., 550 F.3d 1155, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  Ultimately, the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees  \n \n4  This provision is intended \u201cto encourage [FOIA] suits that benefit the public \ninterest\u201d  and to provide a party with \u201ccompensation for enduring an agency\u2019s unreasonable \nobduracy in refusing to comply with the [FOIA\u2019s] requirements.\u201d   LaSalle Extension Univ. v. \nF.T.C., 627 F.2d 481, 484 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ; see also  Nationwide Bldg. Maint., Inc. v. \nSampson, 559 F.2d 704, 711 (D.C. Cir. 1977)  (noting that the FOIA\u2019s purpose was to \u201cremove \nthe incentive for a dministrative  resistance to disclosure requests based not on the merits of \nexemption claims, but on the knowledge t hat many FOIA plain tiffs do not have the financial \nresources or economic incentives to pursue their requests through expensive litigation\u201d ).    \n 7 \n is subject to the Court\u2019s equitable discretion.  McKinley, 739 F.3d at 711; Matlack , 868 F. Supp. \nat 63 0.   \nIn addition to demonstrating that he is entitled to attorne y\u2019s fees  and costs, Plaintiff also \nhas the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the fees requested; he  must do so both for \nthe number of hours at issue and for the relevant hourly rate charged .  Role Models Am., Inc. v. \nBrownlee , 353 F.3d 962, 970 (D.C. Cir. 2004); Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland \nSec., 218 F. Supp. 3d 27, 38- 39, 47 (D.D.C. 2016).  The plaintiff must provide supporting \ndocumentation of sufficient detail and probative value so as to enable the court  to determine, \nwith a high degree of certainty, that such hours were actually and reasonably expended.  Role \nModels Am., Inc., 353 F.3d at 970; Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at  38.  Thereafter, the \nburden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of reasonableness with specific evidence.  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at  47.    \nB. Is Plaintiff \u201cEntitled\u201d to Recover Attorney\u2019s Fees  and Costs? \nSince there is no dispute t hat Plaintiff is \u201celigible\u201d to obtain attorney\u2019s fees  and costs \nhere, the Court will begin with the question of whether Plaintiff is \u201centitled\u201d to recover such monies .  In assessing this issue, the Court will utilize the four above -listed factors .    \n1. The Public Benefit Derived f rom the Case  \n \nFirst, the Court must consider the benefit to the public stemming from the FOIA \ndisclosure.  The public benefit factor is meant to assess the \u201c degree of dissemination and likely \npublic impact that might be expected from a particular disclosure[,]\u201d since the central purpose of the FOIA is to \u201cassist our citizenry in making the informed choices so vital to \u2018 the maintenance \nof a popular form of government .\u2019\u201d  Blue v. Bureau of Prisons , 570 F.2d 529, 533 (5th Cir. 1978) \n(quoting S.Rep. No. 854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1974)) ; see also  Matlack , 868 F. Supp. at 631-8 \n 32.  As a result, the \u201cpublic benefit\u201d factor \u201cdoes not particularly favor attorneys \u2019 fees where the \naward would merely subsidize a matter of private concern [;]\u201d instead, it \u201cspeaks for an award \nwhere the complainant\u2019s victory is likely to add to the fund of information tha t citizens may use \nin making vital political choices.\u201d  Blue , 570 F.2d at  533- 34.  It is in the public interest to \ndisclose information to those in the media or to private parties who  \u201cseek to shed light on the \nactions of the government and the underlying circumstances of newsworthy events .\u201d  Miller  v. \nU.S. Dep\u2019 t of State , 779 F.2d 1378, 1389- 90 (8th Cir. 1985) .  Similarly, when the disclosure \nflowing from a FOIA request has \u201chistorica l significance,\u201d the request is  often deemed to benefit \nthe public.  McDonnel l v. U.S., 870 F. Supp. 576, 585 (D.N.J. 1994) (citations omitted) . \nIn assessing this factor, the Court must consider  \u201cthe potential public value of the \ninformation sought  . . . not the public value of the information received .\u201d  Morley v. C.I.A., 810 \nF.3d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 2016) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added) .  \nA request has potential public value if there is \u201cat least a modest probability of generating useful \nnew information about a matter of public concern.\u201d  Id.  \nPlaintiff argues that the first factor weighs in favor of an award because the requested \ndocuments \u201cshed further light on an international crime committed by military personnel of the \nU.S. government, the subsequent difficulty that the federal government had in retrieving and \ntracking down the remainder of the stolen jewels, and ongoing laundering of  the jewels within \nmilitary ranks, even more than a decade after the original prosecution.\u201d  (D.I. 43 at 11 (citing id ., \nex. C at \u00b6\u00b6 4 -6))  Defendant responds by noting that while the subject matter of the requests is \n\u201cvery interesting,\u201d the records relate to \u201cjewels stolen from German royalty by U.S. servicemen nearly 8 0 years ago [;]\u201d it asserts that \u201cthere is no indication that the records uncovered any high \nprofile or high level crimes or cover -ups, agency or law enforcement incompetence, or individual 9 \n or institutional inadequacies \u2014the kind of information the public would want and need in order to \nmake \u2018vital political choices.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 8)   \nIn arguing about this factor, neither of the parties provided the C ourt with ( nor cited to)  \nany of the actua l records that Plaintiff obtained via his requests.  So, the Court has less \ninformation tha n it otherwise might wish for in order to assess th e issue.  But in a declaration \nsubmitted along with his reply brief, Plaintiff shared a dditional detail about :  (1) the public \nimport of the Hesse jewel theft; and (2) the substance of the FOIA documents that he obtained \nhere.  In that regard, Plaintiff states : \n\u2022 The theft of the Hesse jewels was a \u201cworldwide sensation\u201d in \nthat \u201c [t]hree U.S. Army officers stole the je wels from a \nGerman castle . . . as World War II was ending and smuggled most of them into the United States.\u201d   Nearly all of the jewels \nwere sold to underworld figures in Chicago, and for more than seven decades, that is all that has been known about the j ewels.    \n \n\u2022 The U.S. Army gained enough evidence to convict the officers \nwho stole the jewels, but probed no further.  The FBI subsequently investigated the jewel theft for two years, and its investigatory efforts have not been made public until now. \n \n\u2022 Some of the records that Plaintiff obtained provide \u201cnew\u201d information about the jewel theft and its aftermath.  For example, \u201c[f]or the first time ever,\u201d the record s show that the \njewels \u201cwere quickly resold, most likely recut and scattered across the coun try.\u201d  The records also shed new light on the \nChicago -based \u201cfence\u201d to whom one of the Army officers sold \nthe jewels .  They \u201creveal the existence of a nationwide \norganized crime network of jewel thieves and \u2018fences\u2019\u201d and \u201cdisclose the existence of a highly placed FBI informant who was close to the No. 1 fence[.]\u201d  They  also reveal possible \nanswers to the question of the informant\u2019s motivation for coming forward.  And they \u201cdetailed insight into post -war FBI \nmethods  and tactics, and the challenges of investigating \nproperty crimes when the goods are so easily made untraceable.\u201d  \n 10 \n \u2022 The above information \u201cform [s] the backbone of a lengthy and \ncritical chapter of\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s forthcoming book on the jewel \ntheft.   \n (D.I. 4 6, ex. B at \u00b6\u00b6 6- 17) \n \nIn light of this, the Court concludes that the  first factor militates in favor of an award of \nfees and costs.  There s eems to be no dispute that the Hesse jewel  theft  was a significant \nhistorical event.  Thus, th is subject matter is surely not simply of \u201cprivate concern.\u201d   And \nalthough the Court need only assess the potential  public value of the information Plaintiff sought  \nvia the FOIA, here the information he actually received  seems as if it will be of real public \nbenefit.  Those materials will help shed new light  (thanks to Plaintiff\u2019s forthcoming book)  on, \ninter alia , how the FBI investigated a very high- profile theft event .  This will in turn inform the \npublic about:  (1) the investigatory steps the FBI  did (and did not) take ; (2) the methods the FBI \nused to gather information; and (3) whether or not the FBI\u2019s efforts were ultimately successful \n(and why).  Courts have found that t here is a meaningful benefit to the public in learning about \nthe performance of a governmental agency such as the FBI , especially when the agency is \ninvestigat ing a significant matter like this one .  See Rosenfeld v. U.S. Dep\u2019 t of Justice , 904 F. \nSupp. 2d 988, 998 (N.D. Cal. 2012) ( concluding that this first factor favored an award of fees \nand costs, where the records at issue related to the FBI\u2019s involvement in furthering the political aspirations of former President Reagan);  Rosenfeld v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just ice, 903 F. Supp. 2d 859, \n869 (N.D. Cal. 2012)  (concluding the same, where t he FOIA request was made by an \ninvestigative reporter and his efforts were undertaken \u201cfor the express purpose of disseminating information about FBI activities during the Cold War\u201d); McDonnell , 870 F. Supp. at 578, 585 \n(finding the public would benefit from disclosure of documents to authors who were writing a book about a 1934 fire aboard the Morro Castle Luxury Liner , in that the documents at issue 11 \n related to the FBI\u2019s \u201cinvestigative directions, decisions and omission\u201d and served a  public \ninterest in \u201cdiscovering governmental practices and actions in connection with the [fire] and its \nsubsequent investigation,\u201d  especi ally in light of the \u201c mystery which continues to surround [the] \nincident 60 years later\u201d)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ; Weisberg v.

If the ma tter is one of significant public interest, then FOIA requests that enable \nthe public to better understand those events \u2014and the  government\u2019s investigation thereof \u2014\nprovide a measurable public benefit , even if the events are not of recent vintage .  See Davy, 550 \nF.3d at 1159, 1162 n.3 ( concluding that a plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request was of public benefit , where \nthe request resulted in obtaining documents about President Kennedy\u2019s assassination and the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s involvement therein, since  the documents, \u201cwhile arguably not of \nimmediate public interest, nevertheless enable[d] further research ultimately of great value and interest, such as here  the public understanding of a [long- ago] Presidential assassination\u201d) ; see \nalso McDonnell , 870 F. Supp. at 578, 585; Weisberg , 1987 WL 11984, at *7.  This makes sense, \nas the public\u2019s view of a governmental agency\u2019s performance can be impacted by that agency\u2019s \nlong- term track record, especially as to how the agency  acquitted itself in very prominent  (if \nolder ) cases.   Cf. Piper v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice , 339 F. Supp. 2d 13, 20- 21 (D.D.C. 2004) 12 \n (finding that the \u201c public benefit \u201d factor was satisfied , where the FOIA request sought  evidence \nregarding potential \u201c [g]overnment misconduct relating to evidence tampering in a criminal trial\u201d  \nrelating to a 1972 kidnapping, as \u201c[t]he FBI is a vital part of this nation\u2019s law enforcement \nstructure\u201d and \u201c[d]isclosure of this information will assist the citizenry in making informed judgments and opinions about  the FBI and how it is operating\u201d).  \nFor th e above reasons, P laintiff\u2019s FOIA requests had potential public value (and indeed, \nwill likely have actual public value).  Accordingly, the public benefit factor favors an award of attorney\u2019s fees  and costs .  \n2. The Commercial Benefit to the Plaintiff  and the Nature of the \nPlaintiff\u2019s Interest  \n \nNext, the Court must determine  whether  the second factor  (the commercial benefit to the \nplaintiff ) and the third factor  (the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s interest  in the records) weigh in favor \nof a fee award.  Factors two and three are closely related and are often considered together.  \nMcKinley, 739 F.3d at 712.  When  a litigant seeks disclosure  primarily or exclusively  for a \ncommercial benefit or out of other personal motives, an award of attorney\u2019s fees is generally inappropriate.  See i d.  This is in part because an award of fees and costs in such circumstances is \nnot needed in order to uphold the purpose of FOIA , as th is type of plaintiff  has \u201csufficient private \nincentive to pursue his FOIA request even without the prospect of obtaining attorney[ \u2019s] fees.\u201d  \nId. at  711 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); s ee Matl ack, 868 F. Supp. at 632.  Yet \nif the plaintiff is motivated by scholarly, journalistic, or public interest  in seeking the records, \nthen his request is more likely to be seen as furthering the purposes of FOIA.  See Miller , 779 \nF.2d at 1390; Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at 45 .   \nIn this case , Plaintiff is a career investigative reporter  who planned on writing a book \nabout the Hesse jewel theft.  (D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6\u00b6 1 -3; D.I. 45, ex. D )  On the one hand, Plaintiff\u2019s 13 \n interest in the book is clearly motivated by his longstanding scholarly and journalistic pursuits .  \nThe subject matter of the book relates to misconduct by persons in the U.S. military.  And \nPlaintiff  has worked for decades as a write r for publications that cover the U.S. military ; his prior \nbook was abo ut the U.S. Navy\u2019s Tailhook scandal.  ( D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 1 ; D.I. 45, ex. D ; D.I. 46, \nex. B at \u00b6\u00b6 2 -3)  On the other hand, both parties acknowledge that Plaintiff did have an indirect \ncommercial interest in the FOIA material at issue \u2014in that the material was expected to inform \nthe book\u2019s content, and the book is going to be sold for profit.  T hough the book has not yet been \npublished ( such that it is hard to say for sure how much commercial benefit it will actually bring \nPlaintiff ), here neither side disputes that Plaintiff will likely earn some money from future sales .  \n(D.I. 43 at 12; D.I. 45 at 9-10)   \nIn the Court\u2019s view, factors two and three should favor Plaintiff\u2019s request for fees and \ncosts, at least to some degree.  In this regard, Davy v. C.I.A ., 550 F.3d 1155 (D.C. Cir. 2008) is \ninstructive.  In  Davy, the plaintiff sought documents through the  FOIA in relation to his research \nof a later -published book about President Kennedy\u2019s assassination.  550 F.3d at 1160.  The \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained that simply because a FOIA requester may use the requested material to help publish a book, that  does not \nmean \u201cthat the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s interest is \u2018purely commercial\u2019\u201d ( or that these factors \nshould necessarily weigh against a fee award).  Id.  The Davy Court explained that if the \nrequester\u2019s interest in the materials was to further scholarly research about a topic of important public interest  (as was the case in Davy ), then that interest should \u201cat most\u201d be deemed \u201cquasi -\ncommercial [.]\u201d  Id . at 1161 (int ernal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Davy Court \nnoted that \u201cCongress did not intend for scholars (or journalists and public interest groups) to forego compensation when acting within the scope of their professional roles [;]\u201d thus, factors 14 \n two and three favor ed the  plaintiff\u2019s request , since he had sought the material \u201cnot for its \nrepublication value standing alone  . . . but in relation to a larger work addressing an historical \nissue of national importance.\u201d  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Because the \nrecord provided \u201cno basis to doubt that [the plaintiff\u2019s] purpose in filing the FOIA request and \npursuing litigation was to increase the public fund of knowledge about a matter of public concern ,\u201d the Davy C ourt held that the district court had a bused its discretion in determining that \nthese two  factors weighed against the plaintiff.  Id . at 1162.\n5 \nHere, the record  (including the evidence of Pla intiff\u2019s lengthy his tory of reporting on this \ntype of subject matter)  suggests that the FOIA requests w ere primarily motivated by a scholarly \ninterest in uncovering facts of significant public interest\u2014and not by a desire for pecuniary gain.  As such, any financial interest that Plaintiff has in the future book should not dominate the \nCourt\u2019s consideration as to these two factors.  Therefore, the Court finds that the  second and \nthird factors at least  slightly favor Plaintiff\u2019s Motion.  Cf.  McDo nnell , 870 F. Supp. at 586 \n(concluding that these two factors weighed in favor of a grant of attorney\u2019s fees  and costs, even \nwhere the material would be incorporated into a book the plaintiff  intended to sell, because \u201c[a] \ngenuine  scholarly interest \u2013 no matter how specialized \u2013 clearly weighs in favor of a successful \nplaintiff\u2019s recovery of fees in a FOIA action \u201d and because the plaintiff\u2019s book was about a matter \nof public concern, such that \u201cthe prospect of substantial commercial gain, if even feasible, is secondary \u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ; see also  Kwoka v. I.R.S., 989 F.3d \n \n5  Admittedly, there were other factors at play in Davy that are not present here.  For \nexample, the Davy Court noted that the plaintiff\u2019s book had actually come out before the plaintiff \nreceived the relevant FOIA documents.  550 F.3d at 1161.  And there was some evidence in Davy indicating that the book had not made the plaintiff very much money.  Id .  Nevertheless, \nthe Davy Court\u2019s assessment, set out above, is instructive as to how the Court should weigh factors two and three in this case.  15 \n 1058, 1065 (D.C. Cir. 2021) ( holding that these two factors weighed in favor of the FOIA \nrequester, even though the requester was writing a book related to the information sought , \nbecause the requester had a long- standing scholarly interest in the relevant field  and her research \nwould be of benefit to the public and to the U.S. government ). \n3. The Government \u2019s Basis for Withholding Documents  \nLastly, the Court must assess whether the government had a reasonable or colorable basis \nin law for withholding the requested records.  This \u201creasonable- basis -in-law factor\u201d is \u201cintended \nto weed out those cases in which the government was recalci trant in its opposition to a valid \nclaim or otherwise engaged in obdurate behavior.\u201d  Tax Analysts  v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice , 965 \nF.2d 1092, 1097 (D.C. Cir. 1992)  (internal quotation marks and citation omit ted).  \u201cIf the \n[g]overnment\u2019s position is correct as a matter of law, that will be dispositive.  If the \n[g]overnment\u2019s position is founded on a colorable basis in law, that will be weighed along with \nother relevant considerations in the entitlement calculus.\u201d  Davy, 550 F.3d at 1162;  Wheeler v. \nI.R.S., 37 F. Supp. 2d 407, 414 (W.D. Pa. 1998) .  However, if the government  \u201chas engaged in \nobdurate behavior then an award of fees can be appropriate even if other factors weigh against it.\u201d  Matlack , 868 F. Supp. at 632.  Defendant has the burden of showing that their withholding \nof documents was reasonable.  Davy , 550 F.3d at 1162; Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at \n45-46.  \nIn this case, there is no record indicating that the FBI ultimately withheld  any of the \nrequested records on legal grounds  (such as via an argument that the documents were exempt \nfrom disclosure ).  Instead, Plaintiff asserts that after he filed his requests at issue, he \u201csuffered \ndelays  by the FBI in making an agency determination on his FOIA request\u201d \u2014and that it is th ese \ndelays tha t \u201cfavor a fee award under [this] factor.\u201d  (D.I. 43 at 13 (emphasis added) )   In 16 \n response, Defendant contends  that delays in producing documents are \u201csignificant only to the \nextent that evidence shows that the delay  resulted from a bad- faith refusal to cooperate .\u201d  (D.I. \n45 at 10 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)  (emphasis added) )  For this proposition, \nDefendant quotes from Miller v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State , 779 F.2d 1378 (8th Cir. 1985), a case that \nprovides a good starting point for the Court\u2019s analysis.  \nIn Miller , the United States Court of Appeals for the  Eighth Circuit r eviewed a  district \ncourt\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant (the United States Department of State) and \nthe district court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s request for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees .  779 F.2d at  \n1380- 81.  However, t he quotation from Mille r highlighted by Defendant did not come from the \nportion of that decision that assessed  the attorney\u2019s fees  issue; instead, it was a part of the Miller  \nCourt\u2019s analysis about whether summary judgment was properly granted.  Id. at 1386.  When it \ncame time to assess the fourth \u201creasonable -basis -in-law\u201d factor  regarding the fees issue , the \nMiller  Court explained that approximately 360 documents were eventually released as a result of \nthe lawsuit, and that as to those documents, the defendant was arguing that they \u201cwere not produced more quickly because of a combination of factors, including processing backlogs, confusi on, and administrative error.\u201d  Id . at 1390.  While it found the se reasons to be plausible, \nand that there was no evidence of \u201cbad faith\u201d on the defendant\u2019s part, the Miller  Court ultimately \nconsidered them to be \u201cpractical explanations, not reasonable leg al bases.\u201d  Id .  It noted that the \n\u201cFOIA does not contain a statutory exception for administrative inefficiency[,]\u201d and that when \u201ca private citizen is oblig ed to seek legal services in order to wrest from the government \ninformation which the government ha d no legal reason to withhold from him, he is entitled under \n[FOIA] to be reimbursed for the cost to which he has been put.\u201d  Id.  So, contrary to Defendant\u2019s 17 \n assertion, nothing in Miller  suggests that \u201cbad faith\u201d delay must have been at play in order for \nthis factor to favor Plaintiff.  \nThe FOIA statute states that after Plaintiff made his original request, the FBI was \nrequired to determine \u201cwithin 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays , and legal public \nholidays)\u201d whether it was going to comply with the request , and that if it intended to do so that it \nshould produce the documents \u201cpromptly[.]\u201d   5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)  & (c)(i); Reyes v. U.S. \nNat\u2019l Archives & Recs. Admin. , 356 F. Supp. 3d 155, 167 (D.D.C. 2018) .  The statute  also \nprovides  that in \u201cunusual circumstances [,]\u201d the time limits set out above for a determination may \nbe extended by written notice  to the  requester, and that the agency can further engage with the \nrequester to arrange an alternate time frame.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).  The FOIA statute also \nstates that if the matter proceeds to litigation and the government can show that \u201cexceptional \ncircumstances\u201d exist and that the agency is \u201cexercising due diligence in responding to the request,\u201d then the court can permit additional time for the agency to complete any  record review.  \nId. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i).  The statute  notes that \u201c\u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019\u201d do not \u201cinclude delay \nthat results from a predictable agency workload of requests under this section, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.\u201d   Id. \u00a7 \n552(a)(6)(C)(ii).   \nIn light of these statutory commands, here it is clear that \u2014at least with regard to \nPlaintiff\u2019s origina l FOIA request \u2014Plaintiff was the victim of significant delay.  Plaintiff made \nthat original request in October 2017.  Even assuming that the FBI timely made a determination that it would produce documents regarding that request, the FBI ultimately did not produce the documents \u201cpromptly.\u201d  See Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. Fed. Elect. \nComm\u2019n , 711 F. 3d 180, 188- 89 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (holding that for documents to be \u201cpromptly\u201d 18 \n produced under FOIA, they must typically be produced \u201cwithin  days or a few weeks\u201d of a \ndetermination, not \u201cmonths or years\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  As \nPlaintiff asserts, (D.I. 43 at 13- 14), and Defendant does not contest, (D.I. 4 5 at 10- 11), the FBI \nnever invoked either FOIA\u2019s \u201c unusual circumstances\u201d prong or its \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \nprong a s a defense to this delay .  Instead, the FBI  originally  simply  notified Plaintiff that, in light \nof the agency\u2019s \u201c current workload and staffing levels\u201d  it could take it more than two years to \ncomply with the  request.   (D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 \u00b6 11-12; D.I. 45, ex. A at 25)  After Plaintiff later \nagreed to break his original request up into 950- page blocks  (purportedly so that the processing \ntime would be lessened) , his request then remained unassigned for months.  ( D.I. 43, ex. C at \u00b6 \u00b6 \n20, 25- 28; D.I. 45, ex. A at 26- 27)  By July 2018, nine months had passed since Plaintiff\u2019s \noriginal FOIA request was made; at that time,  no documents had been produced, Plaintiff\u2019s \nrequest was still unassigned , and the FBI began to offer shifting deadlines as to when any part of \nthe request would actually b e fulfilled .  Facing an indeterminant and lengthy path to obtaining \nany records at all , Plaintiff then filed this suit.  Only after  suit was filed did the FBI agree to \nproduce responsive documents  (it began to do so in October 2018, a year after the original FOIA \nrequest was made) .  \nIn light of this record, the Court concludes that:  (1) Plain tiff was the victim of a lengthy \ndelay  in the processing of  his original FOIA request ; and (2) Defendant has not credibly invoked \nany statutory basis to justify that delay.6  Thus, the government ha s not met its burden to set out  \n \n6   In its briefing, Defendant suggested that \u201cit is not clear that Plaintiff suffered any \nsignificant delays\u201d in the processing of his FOIA requests, because Plaintiff  was \u201ctold before he \nfiled suit that he should expect to see the first release of his reques t \u2018in November 2018 at the \nearliest \u2019\u201d and Defendant mailed the first 500 pages of responsive records on October 31, 2018.  \n(D.I. 45 at 11 (citation omitted) )  This argument does not make any sense to the Court.  It \nsuggests that an agency  could avoid being deemed untimely  under FOIA by simply telling FOIA \nrequesters that their documents will be processed by a date extremely far into the future (perhaps 19 \n a reasonable or colorable basis in law for withholding the requested records  for as long as they \ndid.  See, e.g., Reyes , 356 F. Supp. 3d at  168 ( concluding that the purpose of the fourth factor, \nwhich is to \u201c \u2018incentiviz[e] the government to promptly turn over \u2014before litigation is required \u2014\nany documents that it ought not withhold\u2019 \u201d would not be served if it was \u201creasonable for \nagencies to withhold documents for indeterminant periods of time because they have too many \nFOIA requests and too few FOIA staff mem bers[,]\u201d and reasoning that the defendant\u2019s \u201c\u2018failure \nto produce documents  [over a four- month period between when the request was received to when \nlitigation was filed]  due to backlog or administrative issues does not constitute a reasonable basis \nin law\u2019\u201d ) (citations omitted) ; Am.

That cannot be the way the FOIA was intended to work.  \n \nNor could Defendant credibly argue that its production of documents was timely because , \nafter being sued, it agreed to a timetable for production and then largely met that timetable.  Courts have repeatedly noted that to countenance such an argument would run counter to the purpose of the FOIA, which is to incentivize timely production of documents without  the need  \nfor a requester  to resort to litigation.

The fourth  factor therefore weighs in favor of \nawarding Plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees  and costs .  \n4. Conclusion  \nIn sum , the Court finds that all four factors favor a n award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to \nat least some degree.  As a result,  it is clear that Plaintiff is \u201c entitled \u201d to such an award.  \nC. Reasonableness of  Plaintiff\u2019s Requested Attorney\u2019s F ees and Costs  \nHaving concluded that P laintiff is both eligible for and entitled to a n award of attorney\u2019s \nfees and costs , the Court must determine if Plaintiff has met his burden to demonstrate that the \nrequested fees  and costs  are reasonable.   \nThe FOIA allows the Court to award \u201creasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs \nreasonably incurred.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E)(i) .  The plaintiff  must provide contemporaneous \nrecords detailing time spent on legal tasks, the attorneys\u2019  rates, and descriptions of the attorneys \u2019 \nwork \u201cto enable the court to determine with a high degree of certainty that such hours were actually and reasonably expended.\u201d  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at 38 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ; see also  Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in \nWashington v. U.S. Dep\u2019 t of Justice , 142 F. Supp. 3d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2015).  Fees and costs should \nnot be awa rded for excessive, redundant or otherwise unnecessary work.  Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Washington, 142 F. Supp. 3d at  9-10.  With these principles in mind, a \ncourt reviews the provided billing records  and calculates reasonable attorney\u2019s fees ; the typical \nmethod for doing so is to multiply the hours reasonably expended in the litigation by a reasonabl e hourly fee, producing the \u201clodestar\u201d amount.  Am. Oversight v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just ice, 21 \n 375 F. Supp. 3d 50, 69 (D.D.C. 2019) ; Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at 47 .  The Court \nretains discretion to adjust the lodestar amount based on other relevant factors.  Elec. Priv. Info. \nCtr., 218 F. Supp. 3d at 47.   \nHere, Plaintiff has provided the Court with detailed billing records that describe the tasks \nperformed by each attorney, the date on which the task was performed and the amount of hours \nspent performing the task.  (D.I. 43, ex. A; id., ex. B ; D.I. 46, ex. A )  The records are well \norganized and sufficiently detailed , such that the Court is able to asses s the reasonableness \nquestion.   \nA reasonable hourly fee for each attorney is to be determined by the prevailing market \nrate in the relevant community, taking i nto account the attorney\u2019s skill and experience.  Elec. \nPriv. Info. Ctr. v . Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 72 F. Supp. 3d 338, 349 (D.D.C. 2014) .  \nPlaintiff\u2019s  hourly rates for each of its six attorney s in question are based on  the prevailing market  \nrates in the Philadelphia area for counsel with corresponding years of experience.  (D.I. 43, exs . \nD-G)7  Defendant has not objected to the se hourly rates.  Thus, the Court is satisfied that the  \nrates were appropriate.    \nThe Court has also reviewed the descriptions of the work performed by each of the \nattorneys at issue.  On an initial review, the records all appear  to demonstrate that the hours \nbilled were for work performed on this matter , and that the nature of that work was  reasonable \n \n7  Plaintiff\u2019s counsel have charged hourly rates that are consistent with those relied \nupon by Community Legal Services , a Philadelphia -based non -profit organization.  (D.I. 43, ex. \nD)  In the case of the Troutman Pepper attorneys, the se rates were less than what th ose attorneys \nwould normally charge in their everyday practice.  (D.I. 43, ex. G at \u00b6\u00b6 7 -10)  Community Legal \nServices\u2019 fee schedule has been held in the past to be a \u201cfair reflection of the prevailing market \nrates in Philadelphia.\u201d  Maldonado v. Houstoun, 256 F .3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2007)  (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted) . \n 22 \n for litigation of this type.8  According to Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 billing statements, Plaintiff\u2019s \nattorneys worked for a total of 148.48 hours, which, when multiplied by each attorney\u2019s \nrespective hourly rate (and i ncluding the request for costs of $509.56) , provides for the  total \namount of $60,732.84.  ( Id., ex. A;  id., ex. B;  D.I. 46, ex. A)    \nSince Plaintiff has met its burden to establish, as an initial matter, that the requested fees \nare reasonable, Defendant now ha s the burden to challenge and rebut the reasonableness of \nPlaintiff\u2019s request.  See Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v . N.S.A ., 87 F. Supp. 3d 223, 229 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(noting that a FOIA plaintiff meets its initial burden when it submits sufficient evidence regarding its attorney\u2019s billing practices, their skill, experience and reputation, and the prevailing market rates in the relevant community) .  Defendant attempted to do so by raising a few d ifferent \nissues.  (D.I. 45 at 11- 15)\n9  The Court addresses Defendant\u2019s objections  below .  \n1. \u201cStraightforward \u201d Nature of the Cas e \nThe DOJ  first argues that  the sheer volume of billing entries, when viewed as a whole, \nare unreasonable and excessive because \u201c[t]his was a straightforward  FOIA case in which \nPlaintiff filed a Complaint (and later a  Supplemental  Complaint), the FBI processed responsive \n \n8  By way of example, the vast majority of the attorney time entries relate to small \nperiods of time  (i.e., fractions of an hour) billed for work incl uding communicating with the \nclient, reviewing documents , and the like.  (D.I. 43, ex. A; id., ex. B; D.I. 46, ex. A)  The largest \nexpenditures of time were for the case events that one would expect:  the drafting, research and \nfiling of the relevant complaints and the legal briefing in the case.  ( Id.)  Even as to those more \nsignificant efforts, the amount of time expende d did not seem out sized  to the Court  at first \nglance.  ( Id.)  And the relatively minimal request for  $509.56 in costs, ( D.I. 43 , ex. B), is  surely \nreasonable.  \n \n9   Defendant also suggests that if the Court is to award any fees, th en it should \naward \u201cno more than $10,000 for the litigation[.]\u201d  ( D.I. 45 at 15)   Defendant does not explain \nhow it arrived at that figure.   The Court declines to place an \u201carbitrary cap\u201d on Plaintiff\u2019s award \nby blessing a  monetary  amount that Defendant appe ars to have picked \u201cout of thin air.\u201d  Office of \nFulton Cty. District Attorney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice , Case No. 1:18 -cv-5902- MLB,  2021 WL \n4205666, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 16, 2021).  23 \n records, and there was no briefing\u201d  and yet \u201cthere were approximately 342 billing entries by \nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel.\u201d   (Id. at 12-13; see also id . at 15)  In its answering brief, Defendant provides \na number of examples  of time expenditures that it believes were  excessive.  ( Id. at 13)  \nTo be sure, a  reduction of a fee award is warranted when time spent on the litigation is \nexcessive by way of inefficiency, waste, or duplication.  Rosenfeld , 904 F. Supp. 2d at  1008.  \nBelow, the Court addresses each of the different arguments regarding alleged i nefficiency  or \nwaste or duplication that were raised by Defendant : \n\u2022 Defendant argues that it was excessive for Plaintiff to bill 15.6 \nhours ($4,216) for drafting, reviewing, filing and serving the five-page initial Complaint, and 12.4 hours ($5,281.80) for \ndrafting, reviewing and filing the  eight -page Supplemental \nComplaint.  ( D.I. 45 at 13 )  It is true that these pleadings, \nparticularly the original Complaint, were not of great  length.  \nBut it does take some time to carefully research and dr aft \ncomplaints like th ese, and Plaintiff largely allocated this work \nto just one or two attorneys per pleading.  Additionally, pursuant to D. Del. LR 83.5, Plaintiff was required to associate \nwith Delaware counsel in this case; Delaware counsel is required  to file all papers and be familiar with the issues in the \ncase.  So , that will necessarily add some additional costs.  In \nlight of  all of this, and because the hours and fees at issue are \nin line with other awards deemed reasonable in similar cases, the Court does not see a concern here.  See Am. Oversight , 375 \nF. Supp. 3d at 70- 71 (finding an award of $5,324.30 to be \nreasonable for three at torneys\u2019 work on a \u201croutine FOIA \ncomplaint\u201d); Hall & Assocs. v . U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency , Civil \nAction No. 15- 286 (RBW), 2016 WL 10746643, at *6  (D.D.C. \n2016)  (finding reasonable an award of $6,430 for three \nattorneys\u2019 work on an eight -page FOIA complaint , \nencompassing at least 24 hours of work);  cf. Elec. Priv. Info. \nCtr. v . Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 80 F. Supp. 3d 149, 158 \n(D.D.C. 2015)  (reducing the amount of fees awarded for work \nby three attorneys on a \u201cstraightforward, nine -page\u201d FOIA \ncomplaint to $2,535, representing 9.5 hours of work).    \n \n\u2022 Defendant objects to approximate ly 100 time entries, totaling \n17.6 hours ($5,502) that \u201crelated primarily to internal correspondence between co-counsel or review of another \ncounsel\u2019s correspondence with Plaintiff.\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 13)   Most 24 \n substantial here are the entries for Goldstein Law Partners \nattorney  Britain Henry.  Mr. Henry had 5- 8 years of experience \nduring the time of this litigation ; he worked on this matter with \na more senior attorney at Goldstein Law Partners, Tuan \nSamahon, who had 18- 20 years of experience during the time \nof the litigation.  (D.I. 43, ex. A ; id., ex. E at \u00b6 4;  id., ex. F at \u00b6  \n4)  A con servative review of Mr. Henry\u2019s time entries shows \nthat as to  approximately 80 such entries, totaling over 15 hours  \nof attorney work, Mr. Henry billed time relating to  his own \ncommunications  with Mr. Sama hon ( communications that \nsometimes included other team members) , or time spent \nreviewing e -mails that Mr. Samahon wrote.  (Id., ex. A; D.I. \n46, ex. A)  Plaintiff rightly notes that involving a more junior attorney in the litigation can be helpful from a cost pe rspective, \nas it can permit \u201csenior attorneys with relatively higher rates to delegate tasks to relatively junior attorneys with comparatively lower rates[.]\u201d  (D.I. 46 at 8)  And clearly Mr. Henry played an important role in this case for Plaintiff , which should be taken \ninto account in the Court\u2019s calculus.  On the other hand, obviously all of th e time described above relates to \ncommunications that would not have been needed if only one attorney from the firm were performing the particular task at hand.  And so it seems likely that at least some of these charges could have been avoided, without any loss of efficiency, i f only \none attorney (not two) had been involved in the task.  Reyes , \n356 F. Supp. 3d at 170 (\u201cThe Court will reduce Plaintiff\u2019s fee award . . . because the presence of two attorneys resulted in the unnecessary duplication of efforts and fees.\u201d) ; cf. Bloomgarden \nv. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just ice, 253 F. Supp. 3d 166, 179 (D.D.C. \n2017) .  In an  attempt to account for the inefficiency related to \nsome of these charges, while also acknowledging the merits of \nPlaintiff\u2019s argument described above , the Court will reduc e the \namount requested by one -third of the  approximately 15 hours  \nat issue  (i.e., 5 hours) , utilizing the hourly rate that Mr. Henry \nmost often billed at dur ing the litigation ($280/hour).  \nTogether, this amounts to a reduction of $1,400.  \n \n\u2022 Defendant argues that it was unreasonable for Plaintiff\u2019s counsel to spend 9.2 hours ($3,207) on \u201c FOIA research \u201d \nbecause \u201coutside counsel was admitted to this case, presumably to provide FOIA expertise.\u201d  (D.I. 45 at 13)  The Court rejects the idea that si mply because certain attorneys associated with a \ncase are FOIA experts, that means they do not need to do legal research on the state of FOIA law.  The amount of such research here\u2014barely more than one eight -hour day\u2019s worth of \nresearch \u2014is not outsized.   25 \n  \n\u2022 Defendant asserts that it was unreasonable for Plaintiff to bill \n14.7 hours ( $5,316.50) for \u201creviewing releases\u201d (i.e., FOIA \ndocuments provided by Defendant in response to Plaintiff\u2019s requests).   (D.I. 45 at 13)  Generally, FOIA litigants \u201cshould \nnot recover fees for time spent reviewing responsive documents [.]\u201d  WP Co. LLC v. U.S. Small Bus. Admin., 514 F. \nSupp. 3d 267, 278 (D.D.C. 2021) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  However, courts often grant \u201csome fees where document review is necessary to evaluate the sufficiency of production or to challenge withholdings.\u201d  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted); see also  Elec. Priv. \nInfo. Ctr., 80 F. Supp. 3d at 159 ( noting that fees should not be \nawarded for reviewing documents to the extent that the time reviewing is for a purpose unrelated to the FOIA litigation, but fees should be awarded \u201cto the extent that the released documents are being reviewed to evaluate the sufficiency of the release or the propriety of a specific withholding so that the attorney can then challenge the release or withholding\u201d).  Therefore, the Court should award fee s for reviewing \ndocuments when the reviews are conducted with the purpose of determining whether Plaintiff should seek further court -ordered \nrelief, irrespective of whether Plaintiff subsequently challenges the sufficiency of the release.  Elec. Priv. Info . Ctr., 72 F. \nSupp. 3d at  351; see also  Reyes , 356 F. Supp. 3d at 172.  Here, \nPlaintiff \u2019s counsel  has asserted that the review of disclosed \ndocuments was necessary for them to know whether Defendant fully complied with their requests and whether further litigation was necessary.  (D.I. 46 at 9)  Indeed, some of Plaintiff\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s time entries show that counsel was assessing what redactions were contained in reviewed documents, and was  \ndiscussing those redactions with their client.  (D.I. 43, ex. A at \n3, 4, 8)  Defendant, who bears the burden to demonstrate that the fees at issue are unreasonable, did not  explain how or why \nthe reviews w ere unnecessary to the litigation.  Thus, the Court \nconcludes they are reasonable.  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v . U.S. \nDep\u2019t of Homeland Sec ., 999 F. Supp. 2d 61, 75 (D.D.C. 2013) \n(concluding the same).  \n \n\u2022 Lastly, Defendant suggests that, simply as a general matter , the \ntotal amount of  hours worked and total amount of fees \nrequested show that the request is unreasonable .  (D.I. 45 at 13-\n14 (\u201cThe sheer volume of billing on this simple FOIA case is evidence of the excessive nature of this fee petition .\u201d))  The \nCourt cannot agree .  In doing so, the Court again acknowledges \nthat this was not the most complicated FOIA case one will see.  26 \n The pleadings were not lengthy and Plaintiff did not have to \nresort to briefing in order to obtain the records at issue.  Despite this, however, a good deal of work was required of \nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel  in this case .  Four different sets of FOIA \nrequests were at issue, which resulted in production of nearly  \n7,800 pages of record s\u2014records that were produced in many  \ndifferent tranches .  And t he parties at time s sparred over \nwhether certain redactions to the produced documents were appropriate  (although those disputes never reached the Court) .  \nThese fact s, along with complications that arose due to the \npandemic, meant that the litigation lasted f or over four years.  \nDefendant cites to Auto All . Int\u2019l, Inc. v. U.S. Customs Serv., \n155 F. App\u2019x 226 (6th Cir. 2005) as an example of a case where fees were reduced where \u201cthe prevailing party did not exercise sound billing judgment.\u201d   (D.I. 45 at 12)  Bu t in Auto \nAlliance , the Court reduced the fee request by 25% in a \n\u201crelatively unexceptional FOIA case\u201d where the plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted a request for 510.25 hours worked, which the Court categorized as a \u201chigh\u201d number.  155 F. App\u2019x at 228.  Here, in contrast, Plaintif f seeks reimbursement for  only \n148.48 hours of work \u2014nearly a third of the hours at issue in \nAuto Alliance .   \n \n2. \u201cFees on Fees \u201d \nDefendant also argues that \u201cif the Court reduces the fee award, it should reduce [any \naward for] fees on fees  accordingly.\u201d   (D.I. 45 at 15)  It is well established that a FOIA plaintiff \nmay be compensated for \u201c[h]ours reasonably devoted to a request for fees [.]\u201d  Reyes , 356 F. \nSupp. 3d at 173 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ; see also  Am. Oversight , 375 F. \nSupp. 3d at 72 .   \nHere, Plaintiff prevailed in th e litigation .  It was entitled to seek reimbursement for the \nfees expended in pursuing this Motion.  And Defendant makes no specific argument as to why \nany of the \u201cfees on fees\u201d- related expenses tha t Plaintiff seeks are excessive or unwarranted.  (D.I. \n45 at 15)  For all of these reasons, then, the Court declines to reduce the requested award on this \nbasis.   \nIII. CONCLUSION 27 \n For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiff\u2019s Motion is GRANTED-\nIN-PART and DENIED -IN-PART .  The Court also ORDERS that Plaintiff  shall receive  \n$58,823.28 in attorney\u2019s fees (i.e., the entirety of the amount of fees requested, minus $1,400 for \nthe reasons set out in Section II.C.1) and costs in the amount of $509.56.  This amounts to a total \naward of $59,332.84.   \n Dated:  September 30 , 2022   ____________________________________ \n      Christopher J. Burke           UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n \n \n"}
