INTRODUCTION\nPresently before the court in this civil action alleging violations of Section 2 of the\nSherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, is the motion for leave to amend the first amended\ncomplaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), filed by plaintiffs NRT\nTechnology Corp. and NRT Technologies, Inc. (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d or \u201cNRT\u201d)). (D.I. 223) For the\nfollowing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend is DENIED.\nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs filed this action against defendants Everi Holdings Inc. and Everi Payments Inc.\n(\u201cDefendants\u201d or \u201cEveri\u201d) on April 30, 2019, alleging violations of Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct. (D.I. 1) Before a responsive pleading was filed, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on\nJuly 15, 2019. (D.I. 7; D.I. 18, Ex. B) The amended complaint includes Walker Process and\nsham litigation antitrust claims relating to prior patent litigation between the parties. (D.I. 7 at {{\n\n50-60) The Walker Process claim alleges that Defendants violated the Sherman Act by asserting\n\n! The briefing and related filings associated with the pending motion are found at D.I. 239, D.I.\n240, D.I. 256, and D.I. 257.\nUnited States Patent No. 6,081,792 (\u2018the \u2019792 patent\u201d)? despite knowing that it was acquired\nthrough fraud. (/d. at J] 50-56) The sham litigation claim alleges that Defendants violated the\nSherman Act by instituting sham litigation against Plaintiffs and others. (/d. at 57-60) Both\ncounts are premised on Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Defendants knew the \u2019792 patent was invalid\ndue to the prior public use of a kiosk that practiced the claimed method by Global Cash Access,\nInc. (\u201cGCA\u201d). (Id. at J] 20-49)\n\nFollowing a motion practice on the amended complaint, Defendants answered the\namended pleading on October 23, 2020. (D.I. 55) The deadline to amend the pleadings expired\non October 30, 2020. (D.I. 39 at \u00a7 2) Plaintiffs served their first set of requests for production of\ndocuments in November 2020, and Defendants produced documents on a rolling basis beginning\nin March 2021. (D.I. 257 at \u00a73) Plaintiffs served responses to Defendants\u2019 interrogatories and\nsupplements thereto in January, April, June, July, and October of 2021. (Id. at ] 4) On July 26,\n2021, Plaintiffs deposed witnesses Thomas D. McCarley and Jerry L. McCarley, who testified\nregarding the background and development of the technology found in GCA terminals. (Id. at J\n6) The depositions of Keith Boucher and Steven Johnson in September 2021 covered similar\ninformation. (/d. at F{ 8, 10)\n\nPlaintiffs filed the pending motion for leave to amend on September 15, 2021, nearly a\nyear after the expiration of the deadline to amend pleadings, and two weeks before the close of\nfact discovery on October 1, 2021. (D.I. 223; D.I. 168) By way of their motion for leave to\n\namend, Plaintiffs seek to add allegations regarding four prior art systems, i.e., casino cash\n\n? The \u2019792 patent generally describes and claims methods of providing money to an account\nholder at a terminal. Defendant Everi Payments Inc. is the current assignee of the \u2019792 patent.\n3 Plaintiffs and Defendants are sellers of gaming kiosks, similar to ATMs, used by gambling\ncasino patrons to access their funds. (D.I. 223, Ex. B at \u00a2 14)\nadvance systems alleged to be in public use more than one year prior to the January 15, 2018\napplication for the 792 patent, and the inventors\u2019 knowledge and awareness of them. (D.I. 223\nat J 2; Ex. B at ff 21-41) Plaintiffs allege that these factual allegations were not discovered until\nafter the first amended complaint was filed in July 2019. (/d.)\n\nIll. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that after a responsive\npleading has been filed, a party may amend its pleading \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written\nconsent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d and \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies within the discretion\nof the court. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs.\nLitig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to\nthe amendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Arco, 921 F.2d 484, 487 (3d Cir. 1990). In the absence\nof undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the amendment\nshould be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non-moving party. See\nFoman, 371 U.S. at 182; In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1434.\n\nIfa party seeks leave to amend after a deadline imposed by the scheduling order, the\ncourt must apply Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See WebXchange Inc. v. Dell\nInc., C.A. No. 08-132-JJF, 2010 WL 256547, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 20, 2010). A court-ordered\nschedule \u201cmay be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n16(b)(4). \u201cThe good cause element requires the movant to demonstrate that, despite diligence,\nthe proposed claims could not have been reasonably sought in a timely manner.\u201d Venetec Int\u2019l v.\nNexus Med., 541 F. Supp. 2d 612, 618 (D. Del. 2010). The focus of the good cause inquiry is on\n\ndiligence of the moving party, rather than on prejudice, futility, bad faith, or any of the other\nRule 15 factors. See Glaxosmithkline LLC v. Glenmark Pharms. Inc., C.A. No. 14-877-LPS-\nCJB, 2016 WL 7319670, at *1 (D. Del. Dec. 15, 2016). Only after having found the requisite\nshowing of good cause will the court consider whether the proposed amended pleading meets the\nRule 15(a) standard. See E. Minerals & Chems. Co. v. Mahan, 225 F.3d 330, 340 (3d Cir. 2000).\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to amend the first amended complaint is denied. As the\nmovants, Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that they exercised diligence in seeking the\nproposed amendment under Rule 16(b)(4).* See Cordance Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 255\nF.R.D. 366, 371 (D. Del. 2009) (\u201cThe good cause element requires the movant to demonstrate\nthat, despite diligence, the proposed claims could not have been reasonably sought in a timely\nmanner.\u201d). But Plaintiffs\u2019 motion does not address the applicable good cause standard for\nmotions to amend filed after the deadline to amend the pleadings in the scheduling order has\npassed. (D.I. 39 at { 2; D.I. 223; D.I. 239 at 1; D.I. 256 at 1) Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments under the\nRule 15(a)(2) standard do not apply unless and until good cause has been shown under Rule\n16(b)(4) where, as here, the deadline for amended pleadings has expired. See E. Minerals &\nChems., 225 F.3d at 340.\n\nIn addition, the record before the court does not support a finding that Plaintiffs exercised\ndiligence in seeking the proposed amendments. Plaintiffs represent that the proposed\n\namendments are based on \u201crecent discovery\u201d that \u201cincludes [Plaintiffs\u2019] supplemental answers to\n\n\u2018In their reply brief, Plaintiffs suggest that it was Defendants\u2019 responsibility to inform Plaintiffs\nof the proper legal standard during the meet and confer process prior to filing the motion. (D.I.\n256 at 1n.1, 8) It is not the job of counsel to provide legal advice to an opposing party. Rather,\nit is expected that practicing attorneys should be familiar with the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. See Okagbue-Ojekwe v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 2010 WL 3947528, at *3 n.3\n(D.N.J. Oct. 7, 2010).\n[Defendants\u2019] first set of interrogatories served on June 6, 2021, July 1, 2021, and July 20, 2021\nand those documents, including documents produced by [Defendants], referenced therein.\u201d (D.I.\n223 at {3 n.1) In their motion, Plaintiffs do not specify when they first obtained access to the\ndocuments cited in their own interrogatory responses. (/d.) The record indicates that the Everi\ndocuments cited in Plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatory responses were produced in March 2021. (D.I. 240\nat J 16; D.I. 257 at 3) The balance of the documents cited in Plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatory responses\nwere produced by Plaintiffs themselves, and many were from publicly available sources. (See,\ne.g., D.I. 240, Ex. B at 7-35; Exs. D-H) Plaintiffs undercut any suggestion that they acted with\ndiligence in seeking leave to amend based on the production of these documents by\nacknowledging that they \u201cvoluntarily disclosed\u201d these \u201cvery same details . . . in supplemental\nresponses to Everi\u2019s interrogatories\u201d served in June and July 2021, and that \u201cEveri was apprised\nof these systems and NRT\u2019s theory throughout discovery.\u201d (D.I. 256 at 9)\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 arguments regarding the timing of the deposition discovery on the inventors\u2019\nknowledge of the prior art systems are also unpersuasive. Plaintiffs unequivocally represent that\n\u201cEveri was apprised of the[] systems and NRT\u2019s theory throughout discovery\u201d as a result of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 amended responses to Defendants\u2019 interrogatories. (D.J. 256 at 9) These\nsupplemental interrogatory responses were all served before any of the relevant depositions were\ntaken, establishing that the substance of Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amendments was fully developed\nand articulable prior to the deposition discovery. (Compare D.I. 240, Exs. A-C with DJ. 257 at\n491 6, 8-10)\n\nIn their reply brief, Plaintiffs argue that \u201c(t]he proposed SAC could not have reasonably\nbeen presented by the October 30, 2020\u201d deadline because Defendants did not begin producing\n\ndiscovery until March 2021. (D.I. 256 at 3) This argument misconstrues the Rule 16(b)(4)\nstandard by suggesting that an inability to timely amend a pleading within the scheduling order\ndeadline excuses a party from exercising diligence in seeking leave to amend outside of the\ndeadline. Plaintiffs offer no explanation for the delay between Defendants\u2019 production of\ndocuments in March 2021 and Plaintiffs\u2019 submission of the motion to amend on September 15,\n2021, two weeks before the close of fact discovery.* (D.I. 257 at J 5) (\u201cDocuments cited in\nEveri\u2019s Opposition to NRT\u2019s Motion . . . were not produced by Everi until after October 30,\n2020.\u201d). Defendants\u2019 delay in producing documents does not give Plaintiffs license to delay\nseeking leave to amend for an additional six months. See Carrier Corp. v. Goodman Global,\nInc., 49 F. Supp. 3d 430, 433 (D. Del. 2014) (\u201cThe timing of [the] motion, coupled with\npreviously produced discovery and publicly available documents . . . negate the argument for\ngood cause.\u201d). In this district, delays of this length are routinely found to be dilatory. See Pfizer\nInc. v. Sandoz Inc., C.A. No. 12-654-GMS-MPT, 2013 WL 5934635, at *3-4 (D. Del. Nov. 4,\n2013) (finding lack of diligence where the defendant delayed in seeking leave to amend after\nhaving the documents in its possession for four months).\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to amend is DENIED. (D.I. 223)\nAn Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nThis Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written objections\n\n5 Plaintiffs stress that their motion to amend was filed before the close of fact discovery, but this\nfact carries little weight because briefing on the motion was not complete in accordance with the\nLocal Rules until fact discovery was closed, and the matter was not ripe for consideration by the\ncourt until briefing was complete. (D.I. 223 at { 4) .\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Opinion. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to five (5) pages each.\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nwww.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: January 11, 2022\n\nUNITED STATES GISTRATE JUDGE\n"}
