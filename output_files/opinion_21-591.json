This matter has been briefed and is  ready for consideration.  (ECF \nNos. 78, 80, 84).1   \nI. Background  \nA. Procedural Background  \nOn May 23, 2019, Plaintiff  Chertoff Capital, LLC filed  suit against Braes Capital, LLC and Jason \nSyversen in the Eastern District of Virginia (the \u201cPrior Case\u201d).   See Chertoff Capital, LLC v. Braes Capital, \nLLC et al. , Civil Action No. 19- cv-631 (E.D. Va.).  The complaint in the Prior Case alleged claims of \ntortious interference with  a contract against Braes Capital , tortious interference with a business expectancy \nagainst Braes  Capital , common law business conspiracy against Braes Capital and Syversen, statutory \nbusiness conspiracy against Braes Capital and Syversen, and anticipatory breach of contract against \nSyversen.  On June 11, 2019, Syversen filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the Prior Case for lack of \njurisdiction .  On June 14, 2019, Braes Capital  filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the Prior Case for \nlack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.  On July 2, 2019, Plaintiff  filed an amended complaint \nin the Prior Case pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1 ).  On July 26, 2019, Braes Capital and Syversen each \nfiled a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the Prior Case.  On August 26, 2019, Braes Capital and \nSyversen\u2019s motions to dismiss were referred to the Magistrate Judge for a Report and Recommendation \n \n1 The Court finds that additional oral argument is unnecessary.  (ECF No. 86).   2 \n pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).  On October 31, 2019, the Magistrate Judge issued a Report & \nRecommendation (the \u201cReport\u201d).  The Report recommended that all of Plaintiff \u2019s claims in the amended \ncomplaint in the  Prior Case be dismissed with prejudice.  On November 14, 2019, Plaintiff  filed objections \nto the Report and a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.  On November 22, 2019, prior to \nany ruling on the Report, Plaintiff \u2019s objections to the Repor t, or Plaintiff \u2019s motion for leave to file a second \namended complaint, Plaintiff  filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i).  The Prior Case was ordered dismissed without prejudice that same day.  \nOn February 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed a new  complaint against Braes Capital and Defendants Jason \nSyversen and Rampart Holdings, LLC,  in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia.  (ECF No. 1).  Count one of the complaint was against the Defendants for breach of contract, and \ncount two was against Braes Capital for intentional interference with a contract.  Id.  On April 17, 2020, \nDefendants filed an answer.  (ECF No. 16).  On May 28, 2020, the Court directed the parties to show cause \nwhy this case should not be transferred to the District of Delaware  based on the disputed contract\u2019s forum \nselection clause.  (ECF No. 28).  On April 27, 2021, the Court severed count one from count two and \ntransferred count one to the District  of De laware.  (ECF No. 52).  On October 26, 2021, the parties stipulated \nto a nonjury trial.  (ECF No. 76).   \nB. Factual Background  \nDefendant  Syversen founded Siege Technologies, LLC in 2009 and served as  its chief executive \nofficer .  (ECF No.  78-1 \u00b6 1).  In 2016, Siege was acquired by Nehemiah  Security , LLC .  Id.  At some point \nin 2018, Nehemiah\u2019s chief executive officer, Paul Farrell, asked  Syversen if he was interested in buying \nSiege  back from  Nehemiah.  (Id. \u00b6 2).  At that time, it appeared that Siege  could be repurchased for less \nthan Nehemiah had paid for it two years prior.  Id.  Consequently, he became interested in trying to organize \na management buy -out of Siege, repurchasing the company in concert with the other key management \npersonnel.  Id.  To effectuate that management buyout, Syversen needed a source of funds  because t he three \nkey management personnel of Siege \u2014Samuel Corbitt, Joseph Sharkey and Syversen\u2014did not have \nsufficient capital to purchase  Siege.   (Id. \u00b6 3).  3 \n Syversen retained Pl aintiff  to assist with the management buyout acquisition and to find interested \ninvestors.  Id.  He signed a contract with Plaintiff  on November 15, 2018 (the \u201cContract\u201d), which set forth \nthe terms of their agreement.  (ECF No. 78 -2).    \nFirst, the Contract stated  that Plaintiff  was being retained to provide advice concerning Syversen\u2019s \npotential acquisition of Siege via a management buyout acquisition:  \nWe are pleased to confirm the arrangements under which Chertoff Capital, LLC \n(\u201cChertoff\u201d or \u201cAdvisor\u201d) is engaged by you (\u201cClient\u201d) to provide banking advisory \nservices . . . regarding your potential management buyout (MBO) acquisition of Siege Technologies, LLC (\u201cTarget\u201d) from Nehemiah Security, LLC (\u201cSeller\u201d).  \n* * *  \nChertoff will serve as the Client\u2019s exclusive investment bankin g advisor and support the \nClient\u2019s potential MBO of the Target (the \u201cTransaction\u201d).  \n Id.   \n The Contract became effective on November 15, 2018 and was to continue until (1) \u201cthe Client \ndecides not to move forward with the acquisition of the Target\u201d ; (2) \u201cthe Closing\u201d  occurs; or (3) \u201cit is \nmutually agreed upon to extend or terminate [the Contract] in writing.\u201d  (Id. at 3).  There were no additional \nrestrictions or limitations put on Syversen\u2019s option to quit pursuing his management buyout acquisition.  \n The Contract stated that Plaintif f would be paid \u201c4% of the Total Consideration paid for the Target,\u201d \nsubject to a minimum payment of $600,000, but only \u201c[u]pon the successful closing of the acquisition of \nTarget.\u201d  Id.  Syversen, as the Client, also agr eed to reimburse Plaintiff \u2019s \u201ctravel expenses\u201d and \u201cother \nreasonable and documented out -of-pocket fees and expenses,\u201d subject to a cap of $5,000.  Id.    \n The Contract addressed how to calculate the \u201cTotal Consideration\u201d paid for Siege, depending on \nwhether the management buyout acquisition resulted in the acquisition of all of Siege or the acquisition of only a majority of the company : \nThe term \u201cTotal Consideration\u201d shall mean the total amount of cash and the fair market \nvalue of other property paid or payable (including amounts paid into escrow) to the Seller \nin connection with the Transaction.  \n \nIf a Transaction, other than a sale of assets, results in a majority (but less than all) of the \nstock of the Company having been acquired, the Total Conside ration shall be calculated \npursuant to this paragraph as an acquisition of stock in which all of the stock of the 4 \n Company had been acquired at a price equal to the highest price per share paid by the \nPurchaser for any shares it acquired at the time of the Transaction.  \n \nId.  The Contract did not address how to calculate Total Consideration if only a minority stake in Siege was \nacquired by Syversen.  \nThe Contract was amended in early December.  (ECF No. 78- 1 \u00b6 3).  Plaintiff  drafted the \namendment.   Id.  According to the Contract, signed on November 25, 2018, Syversen was the \u201cClient.\u201d  Id.  \nAfter signing the Contract, he created Rampart to be the entity to purchase Siege.  Id.  Syversen was the \nonly member of Rampart, which a lso never had any employees, officers or managers.  Id.  Plaintiff  wanted \nRampart to be a party to the Contract, so on December 7, 2018, the agreement was amended in writing (the \n\u201cAmendment\u201d).   (ECF No. 78- 3).  The substantive terms of the Contract were un altered, but both Rampart \nand Syversen collectively became the \u201cClient.\u201d  Id.  Thus, as of December 7, Plaintiff  was providing \nservices and advice concerning Syversen\u2019s and Rampart\u2019s potential management buyout acquisition of \nSiege.  \nIn late January 2019, Rampart and Nehemiah signed an agreement in which Nehemiah agreed to \nnegotiate only with Rampart concerning the sale of Siege through March 20, 2019.  (ECF No. 78- 4).  The \nperiod of exclusivity was later extended through April 15, 2019.  Id.  On beha lf of Rampart, Syversen \nsearched for possible investors to finance the management buyout and located two:  Braes Capital, located \nin Houston and headed by Alex Clary ; and Three Kings Capital, located in New York City and headed by \nBill Ryckman.   (ECF No. 78 -1 \u00b6 3).  Both companies submitted term sheets and, consistent with Syversen\u2019s \ngoal of a management buyout acquisition, both term sheets provided Siege management with a majority of \nthe resulting board member positions.  (Id. \u00b6 4).  After weighing the opti ons and consulting with Plaintiff , \nSyversen decided that Three Kings Capital was a better choice and began negotiations with it.  Id.   \nAs far as Syversen was concerned, the management buyout acquisition had to include the \ncontinuation of Samuel Corbitt, S iege\u2019s president and co -founder, and Joseph Sharkey, its chief technical \nofficer, in Siege\u2019s management.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5) .  Unless they both agreed to continue to work full time at \nSiege, Syversen did not want to pursue the management buyout acquisition.  (Id. \u00b6 5).  During the 5 \n negotiations , it became apparent that Sharkey was reluctant to continue with the company after a \nmana gement buyout.  Id.  He made a series of demands which needed to be resolved  for him to remain with \nSiege, but they were demands which Syversen could not accept.   Id.  Syversen also understood that Three \nKings Capital did not want to proceed with financing the management buyout acquisition unless Sharkey \ncontinued with Siege.  Id. \nOn April 3, 2019, negotiations with Sharkey reached an impasse and Syversen decided not to \npursue the management buyout acquisition of Siege any longer.  Id.  He told Plaintiff  that the management \nbuyout was \u201cnot tenable\u201d and that \u201cwe need to halt pursuit of the Rampart MBO.\u201d   (ECF No. 78- 6). \nMoments later, Syversen instructed Steven Kaplan, Rampart\u2019s attorney at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw \nPittman, to cease all work and se nd a bill for all work done because \u201cthe MBO is  dead.\u201d   (ECF No. 78- 7).  \nHe copied Plaintiff  on that email.  Id. \nOn that same day, Rampart and Syversen formally withdrew from the negotiations with Nehemiah \nand released it from any exclusivity obligation.  (ECF No. 78- 8).  Syversen resigned from Siege on April \n19, 2019.  (ECF No. 78- 1 \u00b6 5).  He told Ryan Hoffman of Plaintiff  again, ten days later, that he was \u201cnot \ngoing to be pursuing the management buyout.\u201d  Id.  In a letter to Plaintiff  dated May 20, 2019, Syversen \nconfirmed, one more time, that \u201cthe MBO is dead\u201d and had been since April.  (ECF No. 78- 9).   \nNegotiations for the acquisition of Siege by Braes Capital occurred after Syversen announced that \nhis management buyout was not going to work.  (ECF No. 78- 1 \u00b6 6).  In May 2019, he flew to Houston at \nBraes Capital\u2019s request to speak with potential investors it had identified who might be willing to provide financing for its acquisition of Siege.  Id.  Even though he had abandoned his m anagement buyout \nacquisition, Syversen was still willing to assist Braes Capital\u2019s efforts to acquire Siege; he hoped that Siege, \nthe company he founded, and which employed people whom he knew, would continue to be successful if \nacquired by Braes Capital.  Id.  Other than reimbursement of his expenses for that trip, Syversen was not \npaid by Braes Capital to go to Houston.  Id. \nIn July 2019, Braes Capital acquired Siege through an entity it had formed called Braes Sneakers, \nLP (\u201cBraes Sneakers\u201d).  (Id. \u00b6 7).  The purchase price was approximately $15,540,000.  (ECF No. 78 -10 \u00b6 6 \n 3).  Neither Syversen nor Rampart had any role in the negotiations of that transaction between Braes Capital \nand Nehemiah or in the creation of  the structure for that transaction.  (ECF No. 78 -1 \u00b6 7).  Syversen invested \n$250,000 in Braes Sneakers and became a limited partner.  Id.  This investment represents only \napproximately 1.5% of the \u201cTotal Consideration\u201d paid for Siege . \nAs a limited partner of Braes Sneakers, Syversen has no voting rights and does not participate in \nits management.  Id.  He is solely a passive investor.   Id.  Syversen is not a member, manager, officer, \ndirector, full or part time employee, consultant or contractor of Siege or Braes Sneakers.   Id.  He did \nnegotiate with Braes Capital about becoming a part time officer/consultant of Siege, but never came to \nagreement on the  terms of his retention.   Id.  Rampart did not invest in Braes Sneakers, nor did it become a \nmember or manager of Siege .  Instead,  it was administratively dissolved by the State of New Hampshire on \nAugust 31, 2021.   Id. \nSiege is now run by a board of managers\u2014which does not include Syversen\u2014 that has \u201ccomplete \nauthority to manage the business and affairs of\u201d Siege.   (ECF No. 78 -12 \u00a7 6.1).  Braes Sneakers owns 100% \nof Siege.  (ECF No. 78 -10 \u00b6 3).  It has one general partner, Braes Capital.  (Id. \u00b6 4).  According to its limited \npartnership agreement, Braes Sneakers is managed exclusively by the General Partner.  (ECF No. 78- 11 \u00a7 \n4.1).  \u201cNo Limited Partner shall take part, or have the right or power to take part, in the control of the \nbusiness of\u201d Braes S neakers.  Id.  \u201cThe Limited Partners . . . shall have no right or authority to act for the \nPartnership or to vote on matters other than the matters set forth in this Agreement or as required by \napplicable law.\u201d  (Id. \u00a7 4.9 ).  The Braes Sneakers\u2019 partnershi p agreement does not otherwise provide for \nany votes on anything by limited partners.  Id.  As a result of these provisions, neither any current officer \nof Siege , nor Syversen , has any power to direct or control the company\u2019s business.  \nII. Standard of Review  \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P . 56(a), \u201c[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that \nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\u201d  The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. \nSee Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585\u2013 86 (1986).  An assertion 7 \n that a fact cannot be \u2014or, alternatively, is \u2014genuinely disputed must be supported either by \u201cciting to \nparticular parts o f materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored \ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), \nadmissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials,\u201d or by \u201c showing that the materials cited do not \nestablish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible \nevidence to support the fact.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) & (B).  If the moving party has carried its burde n, \nthe nonmovant must then \u201ccome forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Matsushita , 475 U.S. at 587 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court will \u201cdraw all reasonable \ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the \nevidence.\u201d  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).  \nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \u201cdo more than simply show \nthat there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d  Matsushita , 475 U.S. at 586; see also  \nPodobnik v. U.S. Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (stating that the party opposing summary \njudgment \u201cmust present more than just bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \u201cmere existence of some alleged \nfactual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary \njudgment;\u201d a factual dispute is genuine only where \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986).  \nIII. Discussion  \nThe Contract and the Amendment are governed by Delaware law .\n2  T o state a claim \nfor breach  of contract , a plaintiff must establish that a contract existed; the defendant breached an obligation \nimposed by the contract; and that the defendant\u2019s breach damaged the plaintiff.  VLIW Tech., LLC v. \nHewlett \u2013Packard Co., 840 A.2d 606, 612 (Del.  2003).   The parties do no t dispute that a contract existed.  \n \n2 Section 3 of the Contract\u2019s Standard Terms and Conditions states in part that \u201cThe Agreement \nshall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (DE) without \nreference to principles of conflicts of law.\u201d  (ECF No. 78 -2). 8 \n The central dispute at hand is whether the subsequent acquisition of Siege by Braes  Capital  constituted an \nMBO under the terms of the Contract.   \nWhen the contract is clear and unambiguous, the Court  will give effect to the  plain meaning  of the \ncontract's terms and provisions.   Osborn ex rel. Osborn v. Kemp , 991 A.2d 1153, 1159 \u201360 (Del. 2010).  \nHowever , if it is possible to  reasonably ascribe multiple and different  interpretations  to a contract, the Court  \nwill find that the contract is ambiguous.   Id. at 1160.  \u201c An unreasonable interpretation produces an absurd \nresult or one that no reasonable person would have accepted when  entering the contract. \u201d  Id.  If a contract \nis ambiguous, the doctrine of  contra proferentem  applies against the drafting party , and the contract  is \ninterpreted in favor of the non- drafting party.  Id.  \u201cThe parties' steadfast disagreement over interpretation \nwill not, alone, render the contract ambiguous. \u201d  Id.     \nFirst, Braes Capital was never a party to the contract between Plaintiff and Defendants.  Plaintiff \nasks th e Court to construe the acquisition of Siege by Braes Capital as an acquisit ion by Defendants.  \nNotably, the Contract between Plaintiff and Defendants was rescinded prior to Braes Capital \u2019s purchase of \nSiege.  On  this alone, the Court finds that Braes  Capital \u2019s acquisition of Siege was not subject to the \nContract.  Further, Braes Capital independently obtained the funding for its purchase of Siege .  Later, \nDefendant Syversen became a limited partner of Braes  Capital , but his money did not go directly towards \nthe acquisition of Siege.   Considering the $15,540,000 purchase price and Syversen\u2019s contributions  of \n$250,000 and $500,000, through his charitable organization S8 Impact Foundation , it is possible that Braes \nCapital could have acquired Siege without the additional funding .  Regardless, Defendants never received \nownership of Siege under the terms of the Contract.3  (ECF No. 78- 1 \u00b6 7 ).   \nSecond, even if the Court were to construe the contract as binding on Braes  Capita l, the acquisition \nof Siege would not have constituted an MBO under the Contract.  As  mentioned repeatedly, t he term \n \n3 As stated in Defendants\u2019  brief, \u201cDocuments received by the defendants in discovery show that \nMr. Sharkey invested $25,000 in Braes Sneakers and that Mr. Corbitt invested $300,000 in Braes Sneakers, \nboth becoming limited partners.  Their collective investment amounts to approximately 2.0% of the Total \nConsideration paid for Siege.\u201d  ( ECF No. 78 at 11 n. 6).  However, their status is similar to that of \nSyversen\u2019s.  9 \n \u201cMBO\u201d is not defined by the contract.  However, it is clear that Plaintiff intended to assist Defendants in \nraising the funds to obtain control over Siege.  O ther than Defendant  Syversen \u2019s potential , future role with \nBraes Capital , it is clear that the manage rs of Siege did not obtain control over the company after the \npurchase by Braes Capital .  In addition, the Contract clearly indicated that the managers would receive \nmajority ownership of Siege.  Even construing Defendant Syversen\u2019s l imited partnership with Braes Capital \nas ownership of Siege, the result would be that he has a minority ownership interest.   \nThe term \u201cMBO\u201d could be considered ambiguous because of  the fact that it does not seem to \ncontemplate any subsequent purchase of Siege that Defendants could have been a party to.4  However, \nPlaintiff drafted the Contract.  Therefore, ambiguity is to be construed in favor of the non- drafting party, \nthe Defendants.  It would not make sense to extend the Contract \u2014that specifically  indicates that Plaintiff \nwas retained t o help Defendants in an MBO \u2014to any possible transaction Defendants may engage in \ninvolving Siege.   \nFinally, Plaintiff asks the Court to consider anticipatory repudiation as the basis for its breach of \ncontract claim.  Even if the Court were to consider Pl aintiff\u2019s argument, its claim for breach of contract still \nfails.  Notably, this argument was rejected in the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation issued before  \nPlaintiff\u2019s  voluntary dismissal of the Prior Case.  While the Report is not controlling, it is highly persuasive.  \nSection 5 of the agreement between Plaintiff  and Syversen states that the contract remains in effect until \n\u201cthe Client decides not to move forward with the acquisition of the Target. \u201d  (ECF No. 78-2 at 3).  Syversen \nrightfully exercised this option in April 2019.  \nIV.  Conclusion  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court fi nds that the Company Defendant s\u2019 Motion for Summary \nJudgment (ECF No. 77) should be and hereby is GRANTED.  A judgment of even date consistent with \nthis opinion shall issue.    \n \n \n4 Plaintiff argues that the term \u201cMBO\u201d is ambiguous.  (ECF No. 80 at 10).  10 \n IT IS SO ORDERED this 14th day of April  2022. \n       /s/Robert T. Dawson  \n      ROBERT T. DAWSON \n       SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE  \n \n  "}
