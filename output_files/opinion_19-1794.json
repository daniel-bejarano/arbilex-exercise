Metzger et al", "case_number": "19-1794", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "03-07-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nJOHN E. MILLER,  \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n DANA METZGER, et al.,  \n \nDefendants . \n No. 19 -cv-01794- SB \n \nJohn E. Miller , Smyrna, Delaware . \n \nPro Se  Plaintiff.  \n \nAndrew Robert Fletcher,  Rebecca Song, D ELAWARE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE , \nWilmington, Delaware.  \n \nCounsel for Defendants . \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nMarch 7, 2022  \n \n  \n \n \n \n    2 \n BIBAS, Circuit Judge , sitting by designation.  \nFinality is important. Litigants must be able to rely on judicial rulings. So when \na party asks us to reconsider, he must meet a high bar.  \nJohn Miller asks me to reconsider my opinion dismissing with prejudice his \nconstitutional claims against prison officials.  Plus, he asks that I amend it and find \nfacts. Because he fails to meet his burden, I deny his motions.   \nI. MOTION TO RECONSIDER  \nI may reconsider my earlier decision only if Miller shows :   \n\u2022 a change in the law;  \n\u2022 new evidence; or  \n\u2022 the need to correct an  error  of law or prevent injustice.  \nLazaridis v. Wehmer , 591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir. 2010) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) . He does \nnot, so I will not reconsider.  \n1. Retaliation . Miller alleged that officers retaliated against him because he had \nserved as an informant.  D.I. 41, at 4.  But I dismissed those claims  for two reasons : \nFirst, the Constitution does not protect his informant activities . Mem. Op. 4 \u20135. \nSecond , he never said that those activities caused the alleged retaliation. Id .  \nMiller disagrees, citing facts that he added in his briefs opposing dismissal.  Those \nfacts suggest that he  had been helping investigate the very officer who punished  him. \nSee, e.g. , D.I. 47 at 4 . But I may look only at the facts in his  complaint.  See  Pension \nBen. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc. , 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993) . \nAnd his complaint  never linked his informant activities with the alleged retaliation . 3 \n If that had been the only flaw in Miller\u2019s claim, I might  have overlooked it. After \nall, Miller is  litigating this case  pro se . And I hold pro se plaintiffs  to \u201cless stringent \nstandard s\u201d than litigants with  lawyers.  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). But  there was another fatal flaw:  Miller \u2019s conduct \nis not protected by the Constitution.  So his claim  would still have failed. \n2. Prescreening . Miller \u2019s second argument fails  too. He notes that his suit was \ngoverned by the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Under the Act, he points out, a District \nCourt screened his first complain t and ruled that it  had \u201cwhat appear to be cognizable \nand non- frivolous \u2026 claims.\u201d D.I. 10, at 1 (citing 28 U. S.C. \u00a7  1915A ). That finding, he \nargues, barred me from later dismissing the same complaint.  Not so. I may dismiss a \ncomplaint even if it cleared prescreening . Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 F.3d \n103, 109 n.11 (3d Cir. 2002).   \n3. Due Process.  I dismissed Miller\u2019s due- process claim because he had failed to \nallege a protected liberty interest. Mem. Op. 5. He pointed to his punishment  (brief \nisolation and assignment to the Security Housing Unit ) and alleged corruption in the \ndisciplinary proceedings . D.I. 41, at 4 \u20136. But that was not enough because he failed \nto allege that his punishment \u201cimpose[d] [an] atypical and significant hardship\u201d on \nhim.  Sandin v. Conner,  515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995); see also Burns v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr. , \n642 F.3d 163, 170\u2013 71 (3d Cir. 2011)  (punishments resulting from \u201c prison disciplinary \nhearings \u2026 do not usually affect a protected liberty interest.\u201d) . \nMiller retorts that his hardship was abnormal because it was doled out for his \ncooperation in an investigation.  Mot. Re c., D.I. 54, at 4. But that does not make the 4 \n \u201cduration [and conditions] of [his] disciplinary confinement\u201d atypical. Mitchell  v. \nHorn , 318 F.3d  523, 532 (3d Cir. 2003) . Nor does he plausibly allege that he was \npunished for exercising a constitutional righ t. Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653 \n(3d Cir. 2002).  \nFinally , he says, the disciplinary process itself was corrupt: \u201cthere was no evidence \nagainst [him]\u201d and the adjudicators \u201cwere ordered to find [him] guilty.\u201d  Mot. Rec. , \nD.I. 54, at 4. But if Miller \u201chad no protected liberty interest in remaining free of \ndisciplinary custody, then the state owed him no process before [punishing him].\u201d \nMitchell , 318 F.3d at 531.  \nII. MOTION TO AMEND  \nMy last opinion described Miller  as \u201ca \u2018producing,  cooperating informant,\u2019 \napparently during an inmate uprising at the prison.\u201d  Mem. Op. at 2 (quoting D.I. 41 \nat 2) . Miller insists  that this case is not about \u201cthe past uprising,\u201d but rather about \n\u201ca new uprising.\u201d D.I. 64 at 1; Mot . Rec., D.I. 54, at 5. So he asks me to \u201cremove the \nwording [that] the case is connected to the  [earlier]  uprising .\u201d Mot. Rec. , D.I. 54, at 5.  \nI will decline his invitation. True, it appears that I may have misunderstood that \npart of Miller\u2019s submissions to the court. But t o clarify , I did not find or decide  \nwhether there was an uprising. Rather, I explain ed his allegations as I understood \nthem from his  motions and briefs . Besides , none of my holdings  hinged on that \nbackground fact . Had I understood what Miller meant  to say, I still would have \nreached the same result.  So I deny his motion to amend.  \n \n 5 \n III. MOTION TO MAKE FACTUAL FINDINGS  \nLast, Miller requests that I rule  \u201con whether there was evidence of [g]uilt under \nthe circumstances.\u201d Id.  at 1. But when assessing a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, I \ndo not make factual findings. Instead, I \u201caccept all factual allegations in a complaint \nas true.\u201d  Brodzki v. Fox Broad. Co. , 868 F. Supp. 2d 386, 388 (D. Del. 2012) . If Miller\u2019s \nclaim s had  proceeded to trial, he could have secured  such a ruling. But they  did not, \nso he is not entitled to one now.  \n* * * * * \nBecause Miller does not show clear legal error , I will not reconsider my opinion \ndismissing his claims. Nor will I amend that opinion or make factual findings.  \n   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR TH E DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nJOHN E.
