(D.I. 26) to Magistrate \nJudge Thynge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cthe Report\u201d)  (D.I. 25) .  The Report recommends \ngranting- in-part and denying- in-part the motion (D.I. 15) of Defendants, EU Automation, Inc. \n(\u201cEU Illinois\u201d) and EU Automation America Ltd.  (\u201cEU UK\u201d) , to dismiss the Complaint \n(\u201cComplaint\u201d) (D.I. 1) for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue pursuant to Rules \n12(b)(2) and (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, respectively.  EU Illinois  only object s to \nthose portions of the Report denying its motion to dismiss  for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The \nCourt has reviewed the Report (D.I. 25), EU Illinois \u2019s objections (D.I. 26) and the response thereto \n(D.I. 27), and the Court has considered de novo  the objected -to portions of the Report and the \nrelevant portions of the motion to dismiss and Plaintiff\u2019s response thereto ( see D.I 15 -18, 20- 21, \n22).  For the reasons set forth below, EU Illinois\u2019s objections are OVERRULED, the Report is ADOPTED,  and the motion to dismiss as to EU Illinois is DENIED.\n1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe Report set forth the relevant background facts clearly.  As no party has objected to the \nReport\u2019s recitation of facts, the Court adopts that recitation here:  \nPlaintiff Rockwell is the  world\u2019s largest company dedicated to \nindustrial automation and information.  Its products run a variety of \nindustrial and commercial operations including: automotive, food processing, and pharmaceutical assembly lines; critical infrastructure such as oil refineries; and automation involving the safety of amusement park rides.  A commonality among its products is that breakdowns are extremely costly and potentially dangerous.   Thus, Rockwell does not sell to a mass consumer market and its industrial control products include a \u201cquality assurance safety net\u201d \n \n1  EU Illinois did not object to the Report\u2019s recommendation that the motion be denied based on lack of venue.  And Rockwell did not object to the Report to the extent it recommended \ngranting the motion to dismiss as to EU UK  without allowing jurisdictional dis covery .  \nTherefore, the Court adopts those recommendation s.  The motion is GRANTED as  EU UK \nand EU UK will be dismissed from this case.  2 to maintain safe and reliable operation.  Its products are sold only \nby Rockwell and highly trained domain experts employed by its Authorized Distributors (\u201cADs\u201d).  Rockwell monitors its products through its ADs and issues software and firmware updates, product \nsafety notices, and/or recalls designed to preempt problems.  \n \nDefendant EU Illinois\u2019 principal place of business in Elk Grove \nVillage, Illinois.  The Elk Grove Village facility is its only physical location in the United States.  It has no other offices, warehouses, or physical spaces in this country, including Delaware.  All EU Illinois employees work and are paid in Illinois; none travel to Delaware to interact with customers or for any other busi ness purpose.  All sales \nto customers in the U.S. are made solely by EU Illinois.  \n Defendant EU UK\u2019s principal place of business [is] in the United \nKingdom.  EU UK provides \u201csome administrative services\u201d for EU Illinois, but does not control its operations.  It has no U.S. employees, offices, warehouses, or other physical space, including in Delaware.  No EU UK employee was ever directed to travel to Delaware to interact with customers or for any other business purpose.  \n The EU Defendants serve as \u201cmiddlemen\u201d who purchase machine parts in the market to resell.  Part of their business is sourcing obsolete parts for older automation equipment so customers can continue to operate existing equipment with replacement parts rather \nthan purchase new equipment from the manufacturer.  \n EU Illinois advertises parts for sale in the U.S. on euautomation.com/us.  Customers cannot buy directly from the website:  they must request a price quote via a phone call to a \nnumber on the website or a \u201cclick on a link.\u201d  The customer then receives a quote by email or phone and decides whether to purchase at the quoted price.  Any purchase is also made by phone or email.  \n From 2016 to date, EU Illinois generated U.S. sales of $107 million in pre -expense revenue, of which ~$465,000, or 0.4%, was from \nDelaware customers.  Sales of parts reflecting Rockwell -owned \nbrands or trademarks generated ~$19,000, or 4%, of total Delaware revenue, and less than 0.01% of total U.S. revenue.  EU UK does not make sales or generate revenue in the U.S ., including Delaware.  \n The EU Defendants ceased selling and advertising Rockwell products in response to plaintiff\u2019s allegations.  EU Illinois began phasing out sales in October 2020 by no longer accepting orders for Rockwell products from new U.S. customers, and only filling pre -3 existing orders for parts or orders from existing customers.  \nDefendants\u2019 website ceased advertising plaintiff\u2019s products worldwide by November 14, 2020.  EU Illinois made its last U.S. shipment of Rockwell products in August 2021.   \nOn August 11, 2021, plaintiff filed this action alleging \u201cmisleading \nadvertising and sale of infringing Rockwell goods\u201d by defendants.  \nOn October 22, 2021, defendants filed the instant Motion.   \n(D.I. 25 at 2- 5). \n \nOn June 6, 2022, Judge Thynge issued the Report recommending that the motion be \ngranted as to EU UK  and denied as to EU Illinois .  (D.I. 25).  EU Illinois timely filed \u201climited\u201d \nobject ions to the Report\u2019s \u201crecommended denial of EU Illinois\u2019 motion to dismi ss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d   (D.I. 26 at 1 ).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court may dismiss \na suit for lack of jurisdiction over a person.  When a defendant challenges a court\u2019s exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal \njurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence and must do so by \u2018establishing with reasonable particularity sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\u2019\u201d  Turner v. Prince \nGeorges County Public Schools , 694 Fed. App\u2019x 64, 66 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Mellon Bank \n(East) PSFS, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Farino, 960 F.2d 1217, 1223 (3d Cir. 1992)).  \u201cTo meet this burden, \nthe plaintiff must produce \u2018sworn affidavits or other competent evidence,\u2019 since a Rule 12(b)(2) motion  \u2018requires resolution of factual issues outside of the pleadings.\u2019\u201d  Brasure\u2019s Pest Control, \nInc. v. Air Cleaning Equip., Inc., C.A. No. 17 -323-RGA- MPT, 2018 WL 337747, at *1 (D. Del. \nJan. 9, 2018) (quoting Time Share Vacation Club v. Atlantic Resorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d 61, 67 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984)).  \u201c[W]hen the court does not hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss, \n[however], the plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction and the 4 plaintiff is entitled to have its allegations taken as true and all factual disputes drawn in its favor.\u201d \nMiller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Pinker v. Roche Holdings, Ltd., 292 F.3d 361 (3d Cir. 2002)).  \nTwo requirements, one statutory and one constitutional, must be satisfied for personal \njurisdiction to exist over a defendant.  Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. C & C Helicopter Sales, \nInc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 400, 403 (D. Del. 2002).  \u201cFirst, a federal district court may assert personal \njurisdiction over a nonresident of the state in which the court sits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.\u201d   Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)).  The Court must, therefore, \u201cdetermine whether \nthere is a statutory basis for jurisdiction under the Delaware long- arm s tatute.\u201d  Id.  (citing 10 Del. \nCode \u00a7 3104(c)).  \u201cSecond, because the exercise of jurisdiction must also comport with the Due \nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution, the Court must determine if an exercise of jurisdiction violates [defendant \u2019s] co nstitutional right to due process.\u201d   Id. (citing International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945)) ; see also IMO Industries, Inc. v. Kiekert AG , 155 \nF.3d 254, 259 (3d Cir. 1998). \nDelaware\u2019s long arm statute, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104, provides in pertinent part:  \n(c) As to a cause of action brought by any person arising from any \nof the acts enumerated in this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident, or a personal representative, who in person or through an agent:  \n (1) Transa cts any business or performs any character of work or \nservice in the State;  \n (2) Contracts to supply services or things in this State;  \n (3) Causes tortious injury in the State by an act or omission in this \nState;  . . . . 5 These subsections ( (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3)) provide for specific jurisdiction where the cause of \naction arises from the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.  Shoemaker v. McConnell , 556 F. Supp. \n2d 351, 354- 55 (D. Del. 2008).   \nAs for the second prong, the Due Process Clause \u201crequires that a non -resident defendant \nhave certain minimum contacts with a forum state \u2013 contacts that would provide the defendant \n\u2018fair warning\u2019 that he might be sued there \u2013 before a federal court in that forum can constitutionally \nexercise personal jurisdi ction over that defendant.\u201d  Turner , 694 Fed. App\u2019x at 65- 66 (quoting \nKehm Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 537 F.3d 290, 299- 300 (3d Cir. 2008)).  It is \u201cessential in each case \nthat there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privil ege of \nconducting activities in the forum state.\u201d  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958) (citations \nomitted).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nEU Illinois objects  to the Report\u2019s findings that EU Illinois is subject to specific jurisdiction \nin Delaware on two grounds:  1)  Rockwell\u2019s claims do not \u201c arise from \u201d Delaware contacts and \n2) Rockwell fails to establish \u201c minimum contacts \u201d or \u201cpurposeful availment.\u201d  The Court \naddresses each objection below.  \nA. Statute -Based Objection  \nAs noted above, there is no dispute that EU Illinois operates the website \neuautomation.com/us  on which it advertises parts for sale in the U.S, that a three -step personal \ninteraction takes place between EU Illinois and each customer  before a purchase is completed , and \nEU Illinois has generated $465,000 in revenue from Delaware customers, including $19,000 worth \nof accused allegedly unauthorized Rockwell products.  These actions satisfy 10 Del. C. \n\u00a7 3104(c)(1) and (c)(2).  L\u2019Athene, Inc. v. Earthspring LLC , 570 F. Supp. 2d 588, 593 (D. Del. \n2008)  (finding jurisdiction where defendants \u201coperated a website accessible in Delaware, received 6 orders and payments from customers in Delaware and shipped their products to Delaware.\u201d).   \nHere, as in L\u2019Athene , EU Illinois  \u201cpurposefully availed [itself] of doi ng business with Delaware, \nwhich is shown through [ its] conducting business with Delaware residents and knowingly shipping \nproducts to the State.\u201d   Id.  That EU Illinois obtained sales from its efforts that total approximately \n$19,000 is not sufficient to escape jurisdiction .  Applicable to subsections (c)(1) and (2), \u201c[w]here \npersonal jurisdiction is asserted on a transactional basis, even a single transaction is sufficient if \nthe claim has its origin in the asserted transaction.\u201d  See LaNuova D & B, S.p.A  v. Bowe Co., Inc. \n513 A.2d 764, 768 (Del. 1968) .   \nSimilarly, EU Illinois\u2019 s argument that its sales of accused products to Delaware represent \nless than 0.01%  of its gross revenue is unavailing.  In L\u2019Athene , sales in Delaware of \u201cless than \n1% of defendants\u2019 sales for that year\u201d were sufficient to support personal jurisdiction.  L\u2019Athene at 593\u201394.  Similarly, in Tristrata Tech., Inc. v. Emulgen Labs., Inc., 537 F. Supp. 2d 635 (D. Del. \n2008), sales totaling \u201c0.0015%\u201d of defendant\u2019s overall sales were enough.  Id. at 638- 41.  Thus, \nan exercise personal jurisdiction over EU Illinois is proper under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) of the Delaware long arm statute.  \nB. Constitution -Based Objection  \nThe Court must now determine whether the assertion of jurisdiction under \u00a7 3104 comports \nwith federal due process. \u201cDue process requires that sufficient minimum contacts exist between the defendant and the forum state to satisfy traditional notions of fair  play and substantial justice.\u201d \nThorn EMI North Am., Inc. v. Micron Tech., Inc., 821 F. Supp. 272, 275 (D. Del. 1993)(quotations \nomitted).  The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that \u201cdefendant \u2019s conduct and connection \nwith the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d World -Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).  Specific jurisdiction is \nproper where a defendant has purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum stat e, 7 and the alleged injuries arise out of those activities.  Thorn, 821 F. Supp. at 275- 76 (ci ting Burger \nKing Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985)).  \n\u201cTraditionally, when an entity intentionally reaches beyond its boundaries to conduct \nbusiness with foreign residents, the exercise of specific jurisdiction is proper.\u201d   Zippo Mfg. Co. v. \nZippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F.  Supp. 1119, 1124 (W.D. Pa. 1997) (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at \n475).  \u201cDifferent results should not be reached simply because business is conducted over the \nInternet.\u201d  Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at 1124.  The \u201cmere operation of a commercially interactive \nwebsite ,\u201d however,  is not by itself a sufficient basis for jurisdiction anywhere the site can be \nviewed.  Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. v. Ste p Two, S.A., 318 F.3d 446, 454 (3d Cir.  2003) .  Instead, there \nmust be \u201c\u2018some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u2019\u201d   Id. at \n451 (quoting Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Ct., 480 U.S. 102, 109 (1987)).  But w hen a \ndefendant \u2019s website is specifically designed to commercially interact with the residents of a forum \nState, specific jurisdiction is proper because that defendant has \u201cpurposefully availed\u201d itself of doing business with the forum State.  Id. at 452.  Evidence of purposeful availment  can be \u201cdirectly \ntargeting its website to the [S]tate, knowingly interacting with residents of the forum [S]tate via its website, or through sufficient other related contacts.\u201d  Id.  at 454. \nHere, it is undisputed that EU Illinois operated a website access ible in Delaware,  \ncorresponded with customers located in Delaware,  received orders and payments from customers \nin Delaware, and shipped its products to Delaware.  EU Illinois did not simply have a passive \nwebsite.  It interacted via email and telephone to discuss price quotes and finalize orders with \nindividuals in Delaware, and in those communications purposefully targeted marketing efforts \ntowards Delaware residents.  Those efforts resulted in sales to residents of Delaware.  Thus, the 8 sales EU Illinois made are not the \u201ckind of \u2018fortuitous,\u2019 \u2018random,\u2019 and \u2018attenuated\u2019 contacts the \nSupreme Court has held insufficient to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d  Toys \u201cR\u201d Us , 318 \nF.3d at 455 (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475) .  And EU Illinois purposefully availed itself \nof doing business with Delaware .   \nMoreover, t he Court is not persuaded by E U Illinois\u2019 s contention that the sales of relevant \nproducts are less than one percent of its overall revenue , and thus insufficient to establish specific \npersonal j urisdiction.  Rockwell\u2019s asserted injuries due to infringement of the trademarks at issue \narose from E U Illinois\u2019 s directed activity.  Because E U Illinois\u2019 s forum -related conduct forms the \nbasis of the injuries alleged by Rockwell , EU Illinois\u2019 s contacts do not need to be continuous and \nsubstantial.  Osteotech, Inc. v. GenSci Regeneration Scis ., 6 F. Supp. 2d 349, 354  (D.N.J. 1998) .  \nThus, personal jurisdiction over E U Illinois comport s with fair play and substantial justice.    \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the  reasons stated above, EU Illinois\u2019s objections to the Report are OVERRULED and \nthe Report is ADOPTED.  Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 15) is GRANTED -IN-PART and \nDENIED -IN-PART.
