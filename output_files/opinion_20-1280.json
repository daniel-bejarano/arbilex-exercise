No. 20-cv-1280-RGA-MPT \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nPresently before the court are plaintiff's motion for summary judgment1 and \ndefendant's cross motion for summary judgment. 2 Plaintiff seeks an award of benefits \nin her favor or, alternatively, a reversal and remand for further review.3 For the following \nreasons, it is recommended that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED, \nand that defendant's motion for summary judgment be DENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis action arises from the denial of Brenda Baines's (\"plaintiff'') claim for Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance (\"SSDI\") benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act \n(the \"Act\").4 Plaintiff protectively filed her benefits application for SSDI on June 3, \n2016.5 She alleged disability beginning January 4, 20116 due to the following \n1 D.I. 16. \n2D.l.18. \n3 Briefing on the motions are found at D.I. 17 (plaintiffs opening brief); D.I. 19 \n(defendant's combined opening/answering brief); and 0.1. 21 (plaintiffs combined \nanswering/reply brief). \n4 The court refers to the record from the administrative proceeding (D.I. 12) as \n\"Tr.\" The record is consecutively paginated and is referred to as \"Tr. at_.\" \n5 Tr. at 20. \n6 Id. at 20, 256-262. conditions: knee replacement, left hand carpal tunnel, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, \ndepression, anxiety, insomnia, hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, \nmacular degeneration, cataracts, and migraines.7 Her claim was denied initially on \nSeptember 8, 2016, and upon reconsideration on January 11, 2017.8 Plaintiff \nsubsequently requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ).9 \nThe ALJ held a hearing on February 25, 2019, at which he heard testimony from \nplaintiff, plaintiff's husband, and a vocational expert (\"VE\").10 The ALJ issued a decision \non March 13, 2019, concluding plaintiff was not under a disability within the meaning of \nthe Act for the relevant period and denied her claim for SSDl.11 The ALJ found that, \nwhile plaintiff could not perform her past work, she could perform a limited range of light \nwork available in the national economy. 12 \nPlaintiff appealed the ALJ's decision to the Appeals Council, which declined to \nreview the decision, making it a final decision reviewable by this court.13 Plaintiff filed \nthis action on September 23, 2020.14 \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nThe Commissioner must follow a five-step sequential analysis when determining \nif an individual is disabled.15 The Commissioner must determine whether the applicant: \n7 Id. at 289, 382. \n8 Id. at 141-46, 148-53. \n9 Id. at 154-55. \n10 Id. at 65-103.

Could this \nperson perform the claimant' s past work?25 \nThe VE responded the hypothetical person could not. 26 The ALJ then asked if \nthere would be any jobs that person could perform.27 The VE responded such person \nwould able to perform jobs at the light exertional levels including: sorter, general office \nhelper, and inspector.28 \nPlaintiff's counsel then posed a question to the VE regarding what effect \nabsences of two or more days per month due to interference from symptoms would \nhave on the hypothetical claimant's jobs. 29 The VE answered \"[i]f an individual is \nconsistently missing two or more days of work per month, over time, they will not \nmaintain employment. \"30 \n23 Tr. at 22. \n24 Id. at 23. \n25 Id. at 99-100. \n26 Id. at 100. \n27 Id. \n2a Id. \n29 Id. at 102. \n30 Id. \n4 In his decision, the ALJ stated: \nAfter careful consideration of the entire record, I find that, through the date \nlast insured, the claimant had the residual functional capacity to perform \nlight work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except she could \noccasionally climb ramps and stairs, never climb ladders, ropes, or \nscaffolds, and occasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl. She \ncould occasionally be exposed to extreme cold, vibrations, and hazards. \nShe could perform simple, unskilled tasks, not at a fast pace or with strict \nproduction requirements. She could have occasional interaction with the \npublic.31 \n* * * * * \nAfter careful consideration of the evidence, I find that the claimant's \nmedically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to \ncause the alleged symptoms; however, the claimant's statements \nconcerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of these \nsymptoms are not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other \nevidence in the record for the reasons explained in this decision.32 \nThe ALJ concluded, considering plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and \nRFC, she was capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that existed in \nsignificant numbers in the national economy, such as sorter, inspector, and general \noffice helper. 33 \nPlaintiff argues the hypothetical question posed to the VE did not \ncomprehensively describe all of her credibly established impairments.34 She maintains \nthe ALJ's RFC assessment was therefore flawed because he did not consider all of the \nimpairments and symptoms that caused her inability to sustain work. 35 \n31 Id. at 24-25. \n32 Id. at 25. \n33 Id. at 30. The ALJ relied upon the VE's testimony in making his RFC \ndetermination. Id. \n34 D. I. 17 at 1 . \n35 Id. \n5 Plaintiff also argues substantial evidence does not support the ALJ's conclusion \nthat she has the capacity to perform light work given medical evidence the ALJ did not \nconsider. 36 \nDefendant asserts substantial evidence supports the ALJ's RFC assessment \nbecause he considered and discussed the evidence relevant to plaintiff's physical \nimpairments prior to the expiration of her date last insured.37 Defendant notes the ALJ \nwas not required to address every piece of evidence in the record in determining \nplaintiff's RFC.38 \nDefendant also contends substantial evidence supports the RFC assessment, \nbecause the ALJ ultimately found that plaintiff was capable of a reduced range of light \nexertional work, where he relied in part on the findings of the state agency physicians \nwho reviewed the record prior to her date last insured and found she could stand and/or \nwalk for six hours and lift twenty pounds occasionally.39 \nA plaintiff's RFC is her maximum remaining ability to do sustained work activities \nin an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.40 A regular and \ncontinuing basis contemplates full-time employment and is defined as eight hours a \nday, five days per week or another similar schedule.41 The RFC assessment must \ninclude a discussion of the individual's abilities.42 \"[T]he ALJ's finding of [RFC] must be \n36 Id. \n37 D.I. 19 at 1 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545). \n38 Id.

ALJ's Consideration of Plaintiff's Limitations \nPlaintiff argues the ALJ failed to consider all of her credibly established \nlimitations in his RFC findings.53 She maintains the ALJ erred by disregarding \nsignificant portions of medical evidence, specifically, treatment notes from Dr. Pasquale \nFucci related to her right knee treatment and ongoing back pain, as well as treatment \nnotes from Dr. Anthony Alfieri regarding her orthostatic intolerance and fatigue from her \ndisability diagnosis.54 Plaintiff notes if the ALJ chose to reject the evidence of an \nimpairment, he was required to provide a clear explanation on his reasoning for doing \nso. 55 She argues the ALJ failed to do so regarding her right knee, orthostatic \nintolerance, and fatigue symptoms.56 However, the ALJ's failure to cite specific \nevidence does not establish that the ALJ failed to consider it. 57 An ALJ \"need not 'make \nreference to every relevant treatment note in a case where the claimant ... has \nvoluminous medical records.'\"58 Further, a \"written evaluation of every piece of \nevidence is not required,\" so long as the ALJ, at some minimum level, articulates his \n1984). 51 Burns v.

Massanari, 247 F.3d 34, 42 (3d Cir. 2001 )). \n8 analysis of particular evidence. 59 \nAs to plaintiff's right knee, although not discussed with specificity in his decision, \nthe ALJ limited plaintiff to light work with additional postural and environmental \nlimitations to accommodate symptoms such as pain, reduced range of motion, and \ndecreased strength, along with the effect obesity had upon those symptoms.60 The ALJ \nfound these symptoms arise from plaintiff's lumbar degenerative disc disease and her \nleft knee replacement.61 The ALJ discussed plaintiff's progress after her left knee \nreplacement, specifying plaintiff used a cane at the beginning of her physical therapy, \nbut later was able to walk without her cane and resume walking up and down stairs. 62 \nThe ALJ also cited plaintiff's hearing testimony in which she testified she now uses a \ncane on a daily basis. 63 Plaintiff argues if the ALJ chose to reject the evidence of an \nimpairment, he was required to provide a clear explanation on his reasoning for doing \nso_e4 \nThere is no indication the ALJ explicitly rejected evidence of plaintiff's right knee \npain or ignored the treatment notes.65 In fact, the ALJ referenced treatment notes \n59 Phillips v. Barnhart, 91 F. App'x 775, 280 n.7 (3d Cir. 2004). \n60 Tr. at 27. \ne1 Id. \n62 Id. at 712, 718, 726, 757. \n63 Id. at 27. \n64 D.I. 21 at 3. \n65 Moreover, the emphasis regarding plaintiff's knees was consistently on the left. \nFor example, at the hearing, her counsel's preliminary statement specified bilateral \nknee pain as an impairment, yet there was no reference to same during plaintiffs \ntestimony, only to her left. Tr. at 68. When asked about the pain in her low back, \nplaintiff responded, \"[y]es, low back and left leg\" and stated it went \"down to my knee.\" \nId. at 74-75. She also testified that the pain in her lower back and radiating pain in her \nleft leg interfere with her sleep. Id. at 81-82. When asked where pain was located after \nshe had been sitting and needed to get up and move around to alleviate pain, she \n9 which documented plaintiffs right knee pain and evidence of \"bilateral knee OA,\" \nalthough the notes indicate plaintiffs left knee as the primary contributing factor.66 The \nThird Circuit has not required the ALJ to discuss or refer to every piece of evidence on \nthe record, so long as the reviewing court can discern the basis of the decision.67 The \ncourt is able to discern that basis. \nNext, plaintiff contends the ALJ erred by disregarding significant portions of Dr. \nFucci's October 2014 treatment notes related to her lower back pain which recorded \nmedications and trigger injections for pain relief.68 The ALJ's decision specifically noted \ninjections \"in order to combat the back pain,\"69 and referenced her medical provider's \nOctober 2014 observation of a \"reduced range of motion in the low back,\" with no \nswelling, tenderness or deformity.70 He also noted that at the end of the adjudication \nperiod, plaintiff had a normal gait.71 Thus, the court finds the ALJ properly considered \nplaintiffs ongoing back pain. \nPlaintiff argues the ALJ failed to address her history of orthostatic intolerance \nwhich she claims affects her ability to walk and stand for prolonged periods of time.72 \nDefendant notes plaintiff underwent the test for orthostatic intolerance more than \nthree years prior to her amended alleged onset date, and has not shown she was \nstated, \"[i]n my lower back and left leg.\" Id. at 85. The court notes her disability claim \nlisted \"knee replacement\" and did not refer to right knee as a basis for her claim. Id. at \n105, 121, 289. \n66 Id. at 26 (citing id. at 667-68). \n67 See Robinson, 137 F. Supp. 3d at 645. \n68 D.I. 17 at 11. \n69 Tr. at 26. \n10 Id. \n71 Id. \n72 D.I. 17 at 12. \n10 treated for this condition during the relevant period, or that it led to any functional \nlimitations during that period.73 Defendant maintains \"Dr. Alfieri reproduced the 2009 tilt \ntest findings and recommendations in his later treatment notes and noted his diagnosis \nin her 'historyl]\"' but plaintiff does not show treatment or any functional limitations \nrelated to this condition during the period at issue.74 Defendant further argues plaintiff's \nmere reference to her diagnosis is insufficient to set aside the ALJ's decision.75 In \nresponse, plaintiff cites her treating physician's advice that she avoid sudden \nmovements from 2012 to 2014.76 She claims orthostatic intolerance \"affected her ability \nto move suddenly and was not a mere diagnosis.\"77 Although not specifically tied to her \northostatic intolerance, the ALJ's RFC accommodates such a limitation in finding \nplaintiff could \"perform simple, unskilled tasks, not at a fast pace or with strict \nproduction requirements. \"78 \nPlaintiff further argues the ALJ did not address her fatigue from her obesity \ndiagnosis.79 The ALJ did address this limitation when he found \"obesity may have an \nadverse impact upon co-existing impairments. These considerations have been taken \ninto account in reaching the conclusions herein.\"80 He limited plaintiff to light work with \n73 0.1. 19 at 14-15 (citing Tr. at498-500, 501,548,554,559,566). \n74 Id. (emphasis added) (citing Tr. 502, 547, 553, 558, 565). \n75 Id. at 15 (citing Jones v. Sullivan, 954 F.2d 125, 128 (3d Cir. 1991) (mere \ndiagnosis is insufficient to show that a condition results in functional limitations); \nPhillips, 91 F. App'x at 780 (\"A diagnosis of an impairment, by itself, does not establish \nentitlement to benefits ... a claimant must show that the impairment resulted in \ndisabling limitations\")). \n76 0.1. 21 at 5 (citing 0.1. 17 at 12). \n77 Id. at 5. \n78 Tr. at 24-25 (emphasis added). \n79 D. I. 17 at 12. \n80 Tr. at 26. \n11 further restrictions to accommodate symptoms arising from some of her impairments, \nincluding \"the effect obesity may have upon these symptoms.\"81 Further, the ALJ cited \nDr. Alfieri's treatment notes which addressed plaintiff's obesity.82 Two of Dr. Alfieri's \nnotes describe \"[a]ssociated symptoms characterized by fatigue and weight gain.\"83 \nThus, the court finds the ALJ considered the combined effects of obesity, including \nfatigue, on plaintiff's impairments and the symptoms. \nPlaintiff next contends the ALJ was required to consider the combined effects of \nher impairments and treatment on her ability to perform daily work. 84 She specifically \nfaults the ALJ's failure to address her ability to sustain regular and continuing work \nactivity given her numerous medical and physical therapy appointments, and relies on \nthe VE's opinion that two absences per month due to health issues would not permit \nemployment. 85 \nPlaintiff cites the Third Circuit's Kangas v. Bowen opinion which remanded for \nfurther proceedings where \"the ALJ and the Secretary failed to evaluate the effect of \n[the claimant's] frequent hospitalizations on his ability to perform any work on a regular, \ncontinuing or sustained basis, a critical factor.\"86 Plaintiff also relies on this court's \nrecent decision in Todd v. Berryhi/1.87 There, the court determined the ALJ's finding of \n81 Id. at 27. \n82 Id. at 26 (citing id. at 486, 538, 559). \n83 Id. at 486, 538 (emphasis added). \n84 D.I. 17 at 13 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1522 (requiring consideration of the \ncombined effects of all concurrent impairments); Todd v. Berryhill, No. 1: 18-cv-00415-\nRGA, 2019 WL 1995494 (D. Del. May 6, 2019) (remanding due to failure to consider \nthe inability to sustain work)) . \n85 Id.

(citing Todd, 2019 WL 1995494). \n12 no disability was legally insufficient due to the failure to address evidence of the \nplaintiff's disability-related absences, or the vocational expert's testimony on the impact \nof the absences. 88 \nHere, plaintiff argues the record documents her history of numerous medical \nappointments, physical therapy sessions, and surgery.89 The court finds the ALJ did not \naddress the \"critical factor\" of the impact that potential continued appointments and \ntreatment could have on plaintiff's ability to sustain employment, or the VE's testimony \nregarding that ability. Because this failure \"'renders meaningful judicial review of his \ndetermination [of no disability] impossible[,]\"'90 the court recommends the matter be \nremanded for consideration of plaintiff's ability to sustain regular and continuing work \nactivity.91 \nLastly, plaintiff argues a residual functional capacity for light work is not based \n88 Todd, 2019 WL 1995494, at *2 (citing Kangas, 712 F.2d at 778; Ashe v. \nBerryhill, C.A.

Comm'rof Soc. Sec., 678 F. App'x 902, \n904 (11th Cir. 2017)). Defendant argues the number of a claimant's medical \nappointments is not a functional limitation caused by an impairment. Id. Despite the \nEleventh Circuit's comment on this issue, this court has made clear that \"in addition to \nphysical and mental limitations, the ALJ must consider the frequency of a claimant's \nimpairment-related hospitalizations and medical appointments when determining \nwhether the claimant is disabled.\" Todd, 2019 WL 1995494, at *2 (emphasis added) \n(citing Kangas, 823 F.2d at 778).

Campo and Cobbs.97 He notes Dr. Campo \nopined the \"claimant could stand and/or walk about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday and \nsit for a total of about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday.\"98 Dr. Cobbs affirmed the \nlimitations set forth by Dr. Campo.99 The ALJ explained he gave great weight to these \nopinions because they were \"consistent with the examinations of the claimant.\"100 \nBased on the ALJ's assessment of the pertinent evidence, the court finds his RFC \ndetermination was accompanied by a \"clear and satisfactory explanation of the basis on \nwhich it rests.\"101 \n92 D.
