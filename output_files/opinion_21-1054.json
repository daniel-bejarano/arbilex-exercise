Denise Tolliver, who appears prose, filed this action in the Superior \nCourt of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County, on June 28, 2021. It was \nremoved to this Court on July 21, 2021, by Defendants Qlarant Quality Solutions, Inc., \nRonald G. Forsythe, Jr., and Deborah Keller. (D.I. 1 ). Pending is Plaintiffs motion to \nremand, motion for default judgment , and motion to strike reply brief, as well as \nDefendants' motion to dismiss. (D.I. 6, 7, 10, 14). The matters have been fully briefed. \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff filed an almost identical action on November 8, 2017, in the Superior \nCourt of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County, against the Delmarva Foundation \nfor Medical Care Inc. (now known as Qlarant Quality Solutions, Inc.), Quality Health \nStrategies , and Terri Daly. See Tolliver v. Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care, Inc., \nC.A. No. K17C-11-010 NEP (Del. Super. Ct.) (\"Tolliver I\"). The Complaint alleged \nbreach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of Delaware \nCode Title 19, Chapter 11, Section 1108(3), and disability discrimination and retaliation \nclaims. \nThe three counts in the instant Complaint are similar, but not identical to Counts \nI, II and IV of the Tolliver I complaint. The Counts are: Count I, implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing; Count I violation of Delaware Code, Title 19, Chapter 11, \nSection 1108(3); and Count Ill, equal pay, ODEA and DPDEPA disability and retaliation. \n(D.I. 1-1). \nPlaintiff was hired by Qlarant on October 7, 2013. (Id. at ,I 10). When she \napplied for employment , she voluntarily reported her disability in her September 6, 2013 \n1 cover letter. (Id. at ,r 11 ). On February 18, 2014, Plaintiff requested a mental health \nworkplace accommodation . (Id. at ,r 13). On March 25, 2014, she requested a \ndisability accommodation to relocate her workplace to the Kent County, Delaware office. \n(Id. at ,r 14). On May 12, 2014, Plaintiff's employment was terminated when at the \nsame time a lead position became vacant, a position for which Plaintiff was eligible and \nqualified to work with or without accommodations . (Id. at ,r 15). On May 13, 2014, \nPlaintiff requested reinstatement along with an adjustment of equal pay. (Id. at 16). On \nMay 22, 2014, her request for reinstatement to complete her contract at Kent County \nwas denied while the Kent County lead position remained open. (Id. at ,r 17). \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants' stated reasons for her termination and denial of \nreinstatement were pretext; that she was deprived of her right to engage in protected \nactivity without retaliation;1 and, in retaliation for filing a claim of discrimination, \nDefendants refused to hire her in any other open position for which she applied. (Id. at \n,r,r 18, 19, 20). \nPlaintiff moves for remand to State Court and for default judgment. (D.I. 6, 7). \nDefendants move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and Plaintiff moves to \nstrike Defendants' reply brief. (D.I. 10, 14). The Court turns to the issue of whether \nremand is appropriate. \n1 Plaintiff alleges that her employer \"engaged in intimidation and proffered payment not \nto file a claim of discrimination for any reason and specifically violations of The Equal \nPay Act, Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act (ODEA), Delaware Persons with \nDisabilities Employment Protections Act (DPDEPA), and Delaware Unemployment \nCompensation Act.\" (D.I. 1-1 at ,r 19). \n2 II. MOTION TO REMAND \nDefendants removed this matter, asserting federal question jurisdiction in \naccordance with the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d). (0.1. 1 ). Plaintiff moves for \nremand on the grounds that (1) Defendants contractually waived their right to remove \nthe Complaint via a forum selection clause; (2) the parties are not diverse;2 \n(3) there is no federal question; and (4) Defendants did not attempt removal prior to \ncompletion of service of process. Defendants oppose on the grounds that the \nComplaint asserts a claim in Count Ill under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), and \nPlaintiff's remaining arguments do not support remand. \n\"In order to remove a case to federal court, a defendant must comply with the \nstatutory requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1446.\" Meltzer v. Continental Ins. Co., \n163 F. Supp. 2d 523,525 (E.D. Pa. 2001). \"First, the district courts of the United States \nmust have original jurisdiction, which requires either a federal question or diversity of \ncitizenship of the parties.\" Id. \"Second, the defendant must file a notice of removal with \nthe district court, containing 'a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,' as \nwell as 'a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon such defendant or \ndefendants in such action.\"' Id. The party seeking removal bears the burden of \ndemonstrating that the Court has jurisdiction to hear the case. Samuel-Bassett v. KIA \nMotors Am., Inc., 357 F.3d 392, 396 (3d Cir. 2004). Courts must construe the federal \nremoval statutes strictly and resolve any doubts in favor of remand. Westmoreland \nHosp. Ass'n v. Blue Cross of W Pa., 605 F.2d 119, 123 (3d Cir. 1979). \n2 Defendants did not remove the case on diversity grounds. ( See 0.1. 8 at 2). \n3 Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, her pleading is liberally construed and her \ncomplaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). The \nallegations that speak to pay or wages are as follows: \nPlaintiff by email on May 13, 2014 requested employment reinstatement \nalong with adjustment of equal pay for Lead positions in other counties. \n(D.I. 1-1 at ,i 16) . \n. . . Employer engaged in intimidation and proffered payment for Plaintiff \nnot to file a claim of discrimination for any reason and specifically \nviolations of The Equal Pay Act, Delaware Discrimination in Employment \nAct (ODEA), Delaware Persons with Disabilities Employment Protections \nAct (DPDEPA) , and Delaware Unemployment Compensation Act. \n(Id. at ,i 19). \nCOUNT Ill AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n(Equal Pay, ODEA and DEDEPA Disability and Retaliation) \n(Id. at 7). And, in the body of Count Ill, Plaintiff alleges: \nDisability discrimination and retaliation is prohibited by State employment \ndiscrimination law whereby .... \n(Id. at ,i 35). \nPlaintiff argues that there is no substantial and disputed federal question. She \ncontends the Complaint is comprised of only of the following State claims: violation of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; violation of \"Delaware Code Title 19 \nChapter 11 Section 1108(3); and Equal Pay, ODEA and DPDEPA Disability and \nRetaliation .\" (D.I. 6 at 2). Plaintiff states that the \"Delaware equal pay law is titled 'The \nDelaware Wage Payment and Collection Act' (DE Code Title 19 Section 1107 A).\" Id. \nDefendants rely on the Complaint's allegations and are adamant that it states a \nfederal claim under the Equal Pay Act. They argue that if Plaintiff meant to state a claim \n4 under the Wage Payment and Collection Act she would have done so and she may not \namend her Complaint in her remand motion to recast the Equal Pay Act claim as a \nDelaware Wage Payment and Collection Act claim. \nPlaintiff gets two pleading advantages. First, because she is prose, the Court \nmust liberally construe the complaint in her favor. Second, the Court must construe the \nfederal removal statutes strictly and resolve any doubts in favor of remand, that is, in \nPlaintiff's favor. \nThe Complaint makes reference to \"equal pay\" twice. Once in the \"Nature of \nAction\" section, and once in the caption of Count Ill. (D.I. 1-1 at 3, 7). The Complaint \nreferences the Equal Pay Act once concomitantly with a list of violations of Delaware \nstatutes. (Id. at 4). \nCount I raises a claim under Delaware law. Count II raises a claim under a \nDelaware statute. Count II is the only place in the Complaint with a statutory citation, \nand the statute cited is in reference to unemployment compensation . Count Ill contains \nthe words \"Equal Pay\" in its title followed by \"ODEA and DPDEPA, \" both of which refer \nto claims under Delaware law. Count Ill does not contain the words Delaware Wage \nPayment and Collection, but it speaks to \"equal pay\" not to the Equal Pay Act. Nor \ndoes Count Ill contain a statutory citation for any of the claims raised. Notably, the \nComplaint does not contain any federal statutory citations and the equal pay claim is \nlisted with claims raised under Delaware statutes. \nIn light of the way the Complaint is pied, and holding Plaintiff to \"less stringent \nstandards ,\" the Court rejects Defendants ' position that Plaintiff raised an Equal Pay Act \nclaim under federal law. As pied, it cannot be said that the Complaint raises a claim \n5 under the Equal Pay Act. It does not cite to any federal statute and all claims are raised \nunder Delaware law. The Court must resolve any doubts in favor of remand and finds \nthat Defendants have not met their burden of establishing this Court's subject matter \njurisdiction by reason of a federal question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Therefore, the \nCourt will grant Plaintiffs motion and will remand the case to the Superior Court. (D.I. \n6). All other motions will be dismissed as moot. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Plaintiffs motion to remand (D.I. \n6); (2) dismiss as moot all other pending motions (D.I. 7, 10, 14); and (3) remand this \nmatter to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n6 "}
