Andrews", "date": "01-31-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nBASAVARAJ HOOLI, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civil Action No. 21-702-RGA \nLARRY MITCHAM , et al., \nDefendants. \nBasavaraj Hooli, Macon, Georgia. Pro Se Plaintiff. \nRobert J. Cahall, Esquire, McCormick & Priore, P.C., Counsel for Defendant Todd \nCombs. \nJanuary J/ , 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION w,~ District Judge: \nPlaintiff Basavaraj Hooli, who appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis, filed this action on May 17, 2021. (D.I. 2). I will review \nand screen the Complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and will also consider the \npending motions. (D.I. 9, 12, 13, 15, 18). \nBACKGROUND \nWhile not clear, it seems Plaintiff filed this action as an appeal of a \"fraud arrest\" \nand two days imprisonment in Pike County Jail, Georgia. (D.I. 2 at 1). On March 23, \n2021, Plaintiff was stopped for speeding , he provided the officer with his driver's license, \nand was ticketed for driving with a suspended license. (/d.). On May 3, 2021, Plaintiff \npied guilty to the charges. (Id.). The arresting officer did not appear in court and \nPlaintiff appears in this Court as it is \"near to [Plaintiff] and GEICO.\" (Id.). \nThe Complaint refers to GEICO Insurance , a non-party , and seems to imply that \nPlaintiff was arrested because of a mistake made by GEICO when Plaintiff's insurance \npayment was made one day late, GEICO wanted Plaintiff's driver' license suspended by \nthe state, and it canceled his coverage . (Id. at 2) At some point, GEICO wrote a new \npolicy for Plaintiff. Plaintiff seeks ten million dollars from GEICO as compensation for \nhis arrest and two days in jail. (/d.). \nAttached to the Complaint is Plaintiff's Florida driver's license that provides an \naddress for Plaintiff in Georgia. (D.I. 2-1 a 1). When he filed his Complaint , Plaintiff \nprovided a Delaware address. (D.I. 1 at 5). Recent filings indicate that Plaintiff now \nresides in Georgia. (D.I. 19, 20). \n2 Plaintiff has filed a request for counsel and motions to stop GEICO from selling \ninsurance . (D.I. 9, 13, 15, 18). Defendant Todd Combs, president and CEO of \nGEICO, moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim, lack of personal jurisdiction , lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction , improper venue, and insufficient service of process. (D.I. \n12). \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d \nCir. 2013); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court \nmust accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d \nCir. 2008). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \n\"fantastic or delusional \" factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough , 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, \nbefore dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may \nbe granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must \n3 grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or \nfutile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nPlaintiff proceeds prose and, therefore , his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss may be granted only if, accepting the well\u00ad\npleaded allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, a court concludes that those allegations \"could not raise a \nclaim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations ' are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply provide 'labels and conclusions ' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of \na cause of action.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). In addition, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to \nshow that a claim has substantive plausibility . See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. \n10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed , however, for imperfect statements of \nthe legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 11. \nWhen reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint , a court should follow a three-step \nprocess: (1) consider the elements necessary to state a claim; (2) identify allegations \nthat are merely conclusions and therefore are not well-pleaded factual allegations ; and \n(3) accept any well-pleaded factual allegations as true and determine whether they \nplausibly state a claim. See Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n4 2016); Williams v. BASF Catalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014). Deciding \nwhether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nDISCUSSION \nThe Complaint will be dismissed for two reasons. First, as Combs points out, \nvenue is not proper in this District Court. (See 0.1. 12 at 12). Second, the Complaint \nis deficiently pied. \nIn all civil cases, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 determines proper venue. Under 1391 (b), a \ncivil action may be brought in: \n(1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are \nresidents of the State in which the district is located; \n(2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to the claim occurred , or a substantial part of property that is \nthe subject of the action is situated; or \n(3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as \nprovided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is \nsubject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. \nVenue is clearly improper in Delaware because the two Defendants do not reside \nin Delaware . As alleged, Larry Mitcham is the City Administrator of the City of \nZebulon, Georgia, and Todd Combs is located in Chevy Chase, Maryland .1 (D.I. 2 at \n1 ). In addition, venue is improper because a \"substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise\" to Plaintiff's claims did not occur in Delaware . Rather they \nspeak to a Florida insurance policy and Plaintiff's encounter with Georgia law \n1 Combs' motion to dismiss states that he is a resident and citizen of the State of \nNebraska. (D.I. 12 at 3). \n5 enforcement. (0.1. 2). The events or omissions giving rise to a claim must be \n\"substantial \" and events and omissions which only bear \"some tangential connection \nwith the dispute in litigation are not enough.\" Cottman Transmission Sys., Inc. v. \nMartino, 36 F.3d 291, 294 (3d Cir. 1994). Were I inclined to transfer this case; venue \nwould be proper in the District of Northern District of Georgia. The case could be \ntransferred there pursuant to\u00a7 1391 (b)(2), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). \nPlaintiffs claim, however, fails to state a claim. To the extent Plaintiff seeks to \nappeal a ticket to which he pied guilty in the State of Georgia, his remedy does not lie in \nfederal court. There are no procedures in this Court to appeal a Georgia guilty plea. \nFurther, the Complaint makes no reference to either named defendant: Larry Mitcham, \nadministrator of the City of Zebulon, Georgia or Todd Combs, President and CEO of \nGEICO. Rather, GEICO seems to be the intended target. And, while unlikely, it may \nbe possible that Plaintiff could cure his pleading defects upon amendment. \nFor these reasons, the action will be dismissed without prejudice to Plaintiff \nrefiling his claims in an appropriate venue. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) based on improper venue and for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, dismiss the Complaint without \nprejudice to refile in an appropriate venue, and (2) dismiss as moot all pending motions \n(0.1. 9, 12, 13, 15, 18). \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nBASAVARAJ HOOLI, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civil Action No. 21-702-RGA \nLARRY MITCHAM , JR., et al., \nDefendants . \nORDER \nAt Wilmington thisJj_ day of January, 2022, consistent with the Memorandum \nOpinion issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED without prejudice to refile in an appropriate \nvenue. \n2. All pending motions (0.1. 9, 12, 13, 15, 18) are DISMISSED as moot. \n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case. "}
