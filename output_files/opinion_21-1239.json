(D.I. 16)  P laintiff  Darnell Ponder  (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d)  and Defendant are \neach 50% owners of  Electronic Commerce, LLC (\u201cEC\u201d) , a Delaware limited liability company  \n(\u201cLLC\u201d) .  With his Motion, D efendant  seek s to enjoin Plaintiff  from  engaging in a  broad array of \nconduct with regard to EC and EC -related business affairs, including:  (1) \u201cpreventing \n[Defendant] from accessing the books, records , accounts and  information of [EC]\u201d and;  (2) \n\u201ctransferring assets of [EC]. \u201d  (D.I. 16 at 1; see also D .I. 16 -1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2 -15; D.I. 16- 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 2- 15; \nD.I. 17 at 2)   Plaintiff  opposes the Motion.  For the reasons set forth below, Defendant\u2019s  Motion \nis DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND 2 \n  Given t he parties\u2019 desire for a quick resolut ion of the M otion, the  Court will dispense \nwith a lengthy recitation of the relevant factual background.  I nstead , it will reference any \nrelevant facts or portions of the record in Section III below.   \n With regard to this  matter\u2019s procedural background, t he case was removed to this Court \non August 27, 2021.  (D.I. 1)   Defendant filed his  Answer and Counterclaims on September 3, \n2021.  (D.I. 5)   The instant Motion was filed on September  14, 2021, (D.I. 1 6), and briefing was \ncompleted on the Motion on Octobe r 4, 2021, (D.I. 32) .  The parties have jointly consented to the \nCourt\u2019s entr y of a final order as to the Motion, (D.I. 23), and the Court held a hearing on the \nMotion via videoconference on October  6, 2021 (hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d).1  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n   \u201cA requ est for a  TRO  is governed by the same general standards that govern the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction.\u201d   Abbott Cardiovascular Sys., Inc. v. Edwards Lifesciences \nCorp., C.A. No. 19- 149 (MN), 2019 WL 3855015, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 5, 2019)  (internal \nquotation  marks  and citations omitted).  TROs and preliminary injunctions constitute remedies \nthat are \u201cextraordinary\u201d in nature and are only appropriate in \u201climited circumstances.\u201d  Kos \nPharm s., Inc. v.

Sept. 24, 2021)  (noting that a \u201chigh burden [is] placed on the \nmoving party to establish that an injunction is war ranted \u201d as \u201cthe grant of  injunctive relief is an \nextraordinary remedy\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ; Corp.

(D.I. 26)   3 \n extraordinary remedy never aw arded as of right.\u201d ) (internal quotation marks  and citation \nomitted) . \nIn order to obtain a TRO or a preliminary injunction, a movant must establish that:  (1) it \nis likely to succeed on the merits of its  claims ; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm without \nrelief; (3) the balance of harms favors it; and (4) the relief requested is in the public interest.  \nKamdem -Ouaffo v. Task Mgmt. Inc , 792 F. App\u2019x 218, 221 ( 3d Cir. 2019) .  The movant cannot \nbe granted relief if it does not \u201cm eet the threshold for the first two \u2018 most critical\u2019  factors:  it must \ndemonstrate that it can win on the  merits  . . . and that it is more likely than not to suffer \nirreparable harm  in the  absence of preliminary relief.\u201d  Id.

DISCUSSION  \nBelow, the Court will first set out the legal standard for the first TRO/preliminary \ninjunction factor:  establishing a likelihood of success on the merits .  Then it will a ddress \nDefendant\u2019s  arguments  and will explain why Defendant\u2019s failure as to this factor  leads the Court \nto deny the Motion.   \n  In order to demonstrate that there is a likelihood that it will prevail on the merits, a  party \nmust  \u201cprove a prima facie case, n ot a certainty that he or she will win .\u201d  Highmark, Inc. v. \nUPMC Health Plan, Inc., 276 F.3d 160, 173 (3d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted) .  This showing \n\u201cdoes not mean more likely than not\u201d  and instead amounts to a reasonable chance, or probability, \nof winni ng.  Singer Mgmt. Consultants, Inc. v. Milgram , 650 F.3d 223, 229 (3d Cir. 2011) .  On 4 \n the other hand, \u201c it is not enough that the chance of success on the merits be better than \nnegligible [,] and m ore than a mere possib ility of relief is required .\u201d  Fres -co Sys. USA, Inc. v. \nHawkins , 690 F. App\u2019 x 72, 77 (3d Cir. 2017)  (internal quotation marks , brackets, and citation \nomitted).  As was noted above, the \u201c moving party\u2019s failure to show  a likelihood of success on the \nmerits must necessarily result in the denial o f a preliminary injunction.\u201d   Am. Exp. Travel \nRelated Servs.,  Inc. v. Sidamon- Eristoff, 669 F.3d 359, 366 (3d Cir. 2012) ( internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted ).  \nIn Defendant\u2019 s opening brief , when explaining why he was likely to succeed on the \nmerits, Defendant  focuse d only  on two particular types of claims .  The Court will address those \nin turn. \nFirst, Defendant argue d that he is  likely to succeed in this case because he has  shown that \nPlaintiff \u201chas brazenly breached his contractual obligations \u201d that were \u201cowed to [EC] and \n[Defendant .]\u201d  (D.I. 17 at 12; see also  D.I. 32 at 5)  What \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d are being \nreferred to here?  There is  a contract in the record before the Court :  a \u201cLimited Liability \nCompany Agreement of Electronic Commerc e LLC, a Limited Liability Company \u201d (the \u201cLLC \nAgreement\u201d) , which is a  2019 contract entered into  between Plaintiff and Defendant  regard ing \nthe formation and management of EC.  (D.I. 1, ex. B at 124- 37;2 D.I. 18, ex. 2)  In  his Complaint \nin this case, Plain tiff assert s that certain of Defendant\u2019s actions amount to a breach of th is LLC \nAgreement.  (D.I. 1, ex. B at 116- 17)   \nImportantly, however, Defendant\u2019s Counterclaims  do not include any claim  asserting a \nbreach of contract against Plaintiff \u2014either as to a breach of the LLC Agreement or a breach of \n \n2  Citations to D.I. 1, ex. B will be to the document\u2019s ECF -generated page numbers.  \n 5 \n some other contract between the two  men .  (See D.I. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 211- 49;3 Tr. at 85 (Defendant\u2019s \ncounsel acknowledging that Defendant has \u201cnot filed\u201d a breach of contract claim in this case))  A \ntrial court\u2019s charge as to a motion like this is to \u201c analyze the elements of the movant \u2019s claims to \ndetermine whether the movant can likely meet each element .\u201d  Fres -co Sys. USA Inc., 690 F. \nApp\u2019x at 77  (citation omitted) .  However, since Defendant\u2019s pleading does not actually allege \nbreach of contract, it also necessarily does not allege facts demonstrat ing that Defendant will \nlikely establish the elements of a breach of contract claim in this case.  In sum, t he Court does \nnot see  (and Defendant has not explained)  how Defendant  could possibly have demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits as to a claim that he  is not even pressing.  ( Tr. at 85 \n(Defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledging that it was a \u201cfair point \u201d that Defendant could not show a \nlikelihood of success as to a clai m that Defendant ha s not actually  advanced  in his  pleading))  \nThus, this cannot be  a basis on which to grant injunctive relief.   \nSecond, Defendant asserts in his briefing that he is likely to succeed on the merits \nbecause he has shown that Plaintiff \u201c has brazenly breached his . . . fiduciary duties owed to [EC] \nand [Defendant]  by m ismanaging [ EC,] [] orchestrating [Commercial Bank of California, or \n\u201cCBCal \u201d]\u2019s Termination Notice[,] \u201d4 and by \u201c continu[ ing] to directly compete with [EC] through \n \n3  All citatio ns to Defendant\u2019s Answer an d Counterclaims will be to paragraphs in \nthe \u201cCounterclaims\u201d portion of the pleading, unless otherwise noted.  \n \n4  EC is an independent sales organization that represents a bank or other financial \ninstitution and that promotes the  bank/institution\u2019s credit card processing services to third party \nmerchants.  (D.I. 5 at \u00b6 17)  CBCal is EC\u2019s sponsoring bank; however, in light of various \nconcerns that CBCal has raised about EC\u2019s business practices, in July 2021, CBCal filed the above -referenced \u201cTermination Noti ce.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 197)  Pursuant to that notice, EC allegedly \nhas until December 20, 2021 to \u201ceither transfer its business to a new sponsoring bank or to resolve its issues with CBCal such that [CBCal] will rescind the Termina tion Notice.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 \n201)  6 \n [Tangram Paymen ts LLC, or \u201cTangram\u201d5].\u201d  (D.I. 17 at 12)  Defendant does  have a counterclaim \nthat mirrors the se allegation s (or at least some of them) .  In that regard, Defendant has asserted a \ncounterclaim f or \u201cBreach of Fiduciary Duty\u201d against Plaintiff ( the First Clai m For Relief in \nDefendant\u2019s Counterclaims , hereafter referred to as the \u201cbreach of fiduciary duty claim\u201d) .  (D.I. 5 \nat \u00b6\u00b6 211 -28)  I n that counterclaim, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff owes EC and Defendant the \n\u201cfiduciary duties of loyalty, care, hone sty, and a duty to discharge [his] duties in good faith\u201d \npursuant to Delaware law (which the parties agree applies here).  ( Id.)6  Defendant  then  alleges \nthat Plaintiff has breached these duties in various ways, such as by:  (1) \u201cdevot[ing] less than \n[his] ful l time, energy, and attention to [his] duties for [EC] and [] instead devoting time, energy, \nand attention to competing with [EC] by directing business opportunities to himself and his other businesses, including Tangram\u201d ; (2) us ing EC\u2019s assets, monies, an d employees for the \u201c benefit \nof Tangram and [Plaintiff\u2019s] other businesses\u201d; and (3) \u201cdivert[ing] business opportunities \u201d and \n\u201ccorporate assets\u201d from \u201c [EC] to Tangram and [Plaintiff\u2019s] other businesses and otherwise \ndirectly competing against [EC .]\u201d  (Id.)\n7   \n The Court concludes  that Defendant has not done enough to demonstrate why he  is likely \nto succeed on the merits  as to this breach of fiduciary duty claim .  In this regard\u2014and similar to \n \n5  Tangram is a payment  processing company formed and run by Plaintiff and others \n(but not Defendant); Defendant alleges that Tangram competes with and has taken business away \nfrom EC.  (D.I. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 166, 169, 175, 203)   \n \n6  Defendant also brings thre e other counterclaims in  this case (the Second, Third \nand Fourth Claims for Relief in Defendant\u2019s Counterclaims), none of which Defendant has put at issue with regard to this Motion.  (D.I. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 229 -49) \n \n7  Contrary to Defenda nt\u2019s assertions in his brie fing, Defendant\u2019s breach of  \nfiduciary duty claim does not mention CBCal or the Termination Notice.  (D.I. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 211 -28)  \nInstead, that claim, as pleaded, seems to be all about Plaintiff\u2019s association with Tangram.  (Tr. at 86)  7 \n Plaintiff\u2019s own claim regarding a breach of fiduciary duty, w hich the Court recently took up in \nresolving Plaintiff\u2019s motion seeking a TRO , (D.I. 35 at 6 & n.9) \u2014Defendant simply has not done \nenough in his briefing to explain the contours of his  claim and why, pursuant to Delaware law, \nhis claim is strong.  For one thing, Defendant \u2019s briefing wa s not explicit as to wh at type of \nbreach of fiduciary duty claim  he is likely to succeed on ( i.e., the duty of care , or the duty of \nloyalty, or some other such duty).  (Tr. at 96, 98, 104)  Second, in  the nine -page \u201cStatement of \nFacts\u201d section of his opening brief  (where Defendant presumably was setting out the key facts \nthat the Court should consider as to this claim), Defendant included almost no citations to the \nrecord .  (D.I. 17 at 3- 11)  This left  the Court to have to hunt around blindly in order to try to \nfigure out where in the record such facts are actually located.8  See also Gresham v. Delaware \nDept. of Health & Social Servs ., C.A. No. 16- 1315 (MN), 2020 WL 228280, at *5 (D. Del. Jan. \n15, 2020) (n oting that \u201c\u2018 [t]he court is  not obligated to scour the record to find evidence that will \nsupport a party\u2019s claims \u2019\u201d and that \u201c\u2018 [j]udges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in the \nrecord \u2019\u201d) (quoting Perkins v. Elizabeth , 412 F. App\u2019x 554, 555 (3d  Cir. 2011) ; Doeblers\u2019 Pa., \nHybrids, Inc. v. Doebler , 442 F.3d 812, 820 n.8 (3d Cir. 2006)) .  And lastly, in his briefing, \nDefendant  did not advise the Court as to:  (1) what showing suffices to make out a breach of any \ntype of fiduciary  duty under Dela ware law; and (2) how Delaware caselaw involving similar \nfactual circumstances demonstrates that Plaintiff ha s likely  breached th e relevant  duty.  ( See \ngenerally  D.I. 1 7; see also  Tr. at 96)  The  law in Delaware regarding a breach of fiduciary duty \nvaries  according to which type of dut y is allegedly breached .  And in the absence of any \n \n8  This amounts to a violat ion of District of Delaware  Local Rule 7.1.3(c)(E).  (Tr. at \n84-85) \n 8 \n meaningful citation to relevant caselaw (and explanation as to why it supports Defendant\u2019s  \nclaim), the Court cannot conclude that such a claim is likely t o succeed.9   \nIt could well be that Plaintiff\u2019s activities with Tangram ultimately do rise to the level of a \nbreach of a fiduciary duty , such as the duty of loyalty.  But the entry of a TRO or a preliminary  \ninjunction is an \u201cextraordinary and drastic \u201d remedy , and is not granted as a matter of right.  If the \nCourt is going to be asked to grant such extraordinary relief at the beginning of a case\u2014before \nnearly any discovery has occurred and before the parties have had the ability to fully vet each \nother\u2019s  allegations\u2014it understandably would want the movant t o make its entitlement to such \nrelief clear .  Here, Defendant failed to meet his burden as to the first factor in the \nTRO/preliminary injunction analysis, and so the Court must deny his Motion .  \nIV. CONCLUS ION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendant\u2019s  Motion is  DENIE D.   \n \nDated :  November 12, 2021    ____________________________________ \n       Christopher J. Burke        UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n \n9  At oral argument, Defendant\u2019s counsel stated that a \u201cbreach of a fiduciary duty, \nwhich is . . . essentially what this action is about,  \u2026 is rather  \u2018basic\u2019\u201d and t hat the elements of a \nbreach of fiduciary duty claim are \u201crather standard throughout and [] assume[dly] [] are in Delaware as well\u201d; counsel said that Defendant did not include citation to relevant law in his briefing because \u201c[Defendant] thought it was ra ther apparent.\u201d  (Tr. at 81-82)  The Court is not \nso sure that Delaware law regarding the breach of various fiduciary duties is, in fact, \u201cbasic.\u201d  But at a minimum, in order to show a likelihood of success as to a breach of fiduciary duty claim, a par ty would need to specify what duty is at issue and provide at least some citation to \nrelevant caselaw \u2014so as to demonstrate that, on these facts, a fact finder would have a good basis \nto conclude that such a breach has likely occurred.  Indeed, later in oral ar gument, Defendant\u2019s \ncounsel acknowledged that \u201c[t] here [wa]s no question that [counsel] should have included [legal \ncitations to relevant case law]\u201d in Defendant\u2019s briefing.
