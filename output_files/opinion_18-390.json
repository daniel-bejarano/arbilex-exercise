(\u201cVifor France\u201d) (c ollectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d  or \n\u201cVifor\u201d ) brought this Hatch -Waxman action against Defendant Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. \n(\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cTeva\u201d ).  Teva has filed an Abbreviated Ne w Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) with \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) seeking approval to market a generic version \n(\u201cANDA product\u201d) of Vifor\u2019s Velphoro\u00ae product before expiration of United States Patent No. \n9,561,251 (JTX -1 (\u201cthe \u2019251 patent \u201d)).  Plaintiffs allege that Teva\u2019s ANDA product will infringe  \nclaims 29, 30, 33, and 56 of  the \u2019251 patent.  Teva denies infringement of claims 29 and 30 and \nasserts that all four of the asserted claims are invalid.    \nThe Court construed the disputed claim terms on September 5, 2019.   (D.I. 114).1  In \nJanuary 2021, the Court conducted a four -day bench trial.  (See D.I. 302-305 (\u201cTr.\u201d)).  The parties \ncompleted post -trial briefing on April 7, 2021.  (D.I. 297, 299, 307, 309, 312, 313).  With th eir \nbriefing, t he parties submitted proposed findings of fact .  (D.I. 298, 300, 306, 308).  \nPursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and after having considered \nthe entire record and the applicable law, the Court concludes that:  (1) Teva\u2019s ANDA product \ninfringes claims  33 and 56 of the \u2019251 patent;2 (2) Vifor has prove d that Teva\u2019s ANDA product \ninfringes claims 29 and 30 of the \u2019251 patent ; (3) Teva has failed to prove that claims 29, 30, 33, \nand 56 of the  \u2019251 patent are invalid for obviousness ; and (4) Teva has failed to prove that claim s \n \n1  This case was originally assigned to the Honorable Leonard P. Stark and re assigned to the \nundersigned judge on December 12, 2019.  Judge Stark construed the disputed claim terms. \n \n2  Defendant stipulated to infringement of claims 33 and 56 if those claims are valid. 2 29 and 30 are invalid for lack o f enablement .  This opinion constitutes the Court\u2019s findings of fact \nand conclusions of law. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT  (\u201cFF\u201d) \nA. Introduction \n1. Plaintiff Vifor Switzerland is a corporation organized and existing under the laws \nof Switzerland and has its principal place of business at Rechenstra\u00dfe 37, St. Gallen, 9011, \nSwitzerland.

The \u2019251 patent, entitled Pharmaceutical Compositions, issued on \nFebruary  7, 2017.  (JTX -1).  The \u2019251 patent claims priority to PCT/EP2008/065444 filed on \nNovember 13, 2008, which in turn claims priority to EP 07120837 filed on November 16, 2007.  (D.I.  277, Ex. 1 \u00b6 8 ).  The \u00a7 371 date is May 14, 2010.  ( JTX-1). \n18. The inventors of the \u20192 51 patent are Ludwig Daniel Weibel and Erik Philipp.  \n(D.I.  277, Ex. 1 \u00b6 7).  \n19. The \u2019251 patent is directed to pharmaceutical compositions with a high load of iron \noxy-hydroxide \u2013 at least 500 mg iron oxy-hydroxide per dosage form \u2013 in a form suitable for oral \nadministration .  (E.g., JTX -1 at 1:5-11, 15:23-31).  \n20. Vifor Switzerland is the current owner of the \u2019251 patent.  (D.I. 284). \n21. Vifor asserts c laims 29, 30, 33, and 56 against Teva.  Claims 29, 30, and 33 are \ndependent on Claim 1, which claims:  \nA pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective phosphate -\nadsorbing amount of iron oxy- hydroxide in high loading of 10 to \n80% (w/w) expressed in relation to the total weight of the \npharmaceutical composition, and carbohydrates, said carbohydrates compromising saccharose and starch, in a form suitable for oral administration, wherein the amount of iron oxy- hydroxide per \ndosage form is at least 500 mg. \n22. Claim 29 adds:  \nThe composition according to claim 1, wherein the iron oxy-\nhydroxide is essentially non-bioabsorbable. \n  7 23. Claim 30 adds to claim 1:   \nThe composition according to claim 1, having an iron release rate of \nbelow 2.5% w/w. \n24. Dependent claim 33 claims:  \nThe composition according to claim 32, wherein dosage form is \nselected from chewable tablets.  \n25. Claim 32, in turn, claims:  \nThe composition according to claim 1, which is a dosage form capable of disintegration in the oral cavity.  \n26. Dependent claim 56 depends from dependent claim 55, which depends from \nindependent claim 27.  Claim 27 claims: \nA method for treating hyperphosphatemia, comprising the steps of \norally administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an \neffective phosphate -adsorbing amount of iron oxy- hydroxide in \nhigh loading of 10 to 80% (w/w) expressed in relation to the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition, and carbohydrates, said carbohydrates comprising saccharose and starch, in a form suitable for oral a dministration, wherein the amount of iron oxy-hydroxide \nper dosage form is at least 500 mg to a patient in need thereof. \n 27. Claim 55 claims:  \nThe method according to claim 27, comprising 700 to 1700 mg iron oxy-hydroxide per dosage form. \n 28. Claim 56 claims:  \nThe method according to claim 55, comprising about 800 mg iron oxy-hydroxide per dosage form. \nD. Velphoro  \n29. Vifor France holds an approved New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) under Section \n505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a), for sucroferric 8 oxyhydroxide chewable tablets, 500 mg (NDA No. 205109), sold under the trade name Velphoro.  \nVifor France received FDA approval for Velphoro in November 2013.  (D.I. 277, Ex. 1 \u00b6 10). \n30. Velphoro is \u201ca phosphate binder indicated for the control of serum phosphorus \nlevels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.\u201d  ( DTX-264 at 2).   \n31. Patients with chronic kidney disease may suffer from hyperphosphatemia, which \nmeans their serum phosphorus levels are above the normal acceptable range for the general population.  ( Tr. at 84:10 -14).  Hyperphosphatemia can cause calcification in the blood vessels  \nand some other tissues resulting in decreased elasticity.  (Tr. at 84:1 5-85:2 ). \n32. Velphoro contains iron oxy- hydroxide, sucrose (saccharose) , and starch.  (DTX -\n264 at 6).  Each 2577.5 mg chewable Velphoro tablet\n5 contains 2500 mg of sucroferric \noxyhydroxide, which corresponds to 500 mg of iron, which in turn corresponds to 800 mg of iron oxy-hydroxide .  (PTX -322 at 10 ; Tr. at 698:19-699:2 ).  Thus, iron oxy- hydroxide equals 31.0 \npercent by weight of the Velphoro tablet.  (Tr. at 699:6 -11).  \n33. The active moiety of Velphoro, polynuclear iron(III) -oxyhydroxide (pn -FeOOH), \nis practically insoluble and therefore not absorbed and not metabolized.  (DTX-264 at 6).   \n34. Velphoro\n satisfies all of the limitations of the four asserted claims  and is an \nembodiment of those claims.  ( Tr. at 698:1 6-700:12; PTX -322 at 57; DTX-264 at 6).6   \nE. Person of Skill in the Art  \n35. Plaintiffs \u2019 expert opined that a \u201cperson of ordinary ski ll in the art [\u201cPOSA\u201d] would \nhave at least the equivalent of a master\u2019s degree in chemistry, chemical engineering, pharmacy, \n \n5  A chewable tablet is a dosage form capable of disi ntegration in the oral cavity.  (JTX -1, \ncol. 3, l. 52-67).  \n \n6  Teva d oes not dispute that Velphoro practices all of the limitations of th e four asserted \nclaims.  9 pharmacology or pharmaceutics  or a comparable field, and four years of academic research or \nindustry experience related  to pharmaceutical formulation development.  Alternatively, the POSA \ncan have a higher level of  formal education such as a Ph.D. and with subsequent fewer years of \nrelevant experience. The  POSA would also have access to individuals with knowledge and \nexper ience in fields such as  iron chemistry, iron biochemistry, nephrology and treatment of \npatients with chronic kidney disease.\u201d  ( Tr. at 646:3 -16). \n36. According to Defendant , a POSA at the relevant time would have possessed at least \na bachelor\u2019s  degree, and more likely a master\u2019s  or Doctoral degree, in the field of pharmaceutical \nsciences or a related discipline, and several years of experience formulating dosage forms \ncontaining pharmaceutically active compounds.  A POSA could have a lower level of formal \neducation if such person had a higher degree of experience.  Furthermore, because drug discovery \nand development is a multidisciplinary effort, a POSA might interface or consul t with individuals \nhaving specialized expertise such as, for example, a physician with experience in the \nadministration, dosing, and efficacy of drugs for treating hyperphosphatemia.  (D.I. 300 \u00b6  22). \n37. There is no meaningful difference between the parties\u2019 proposed definitions.  Each \nof the experts who opined on the definition of a person of skill in the art agreed that his opinions \nwould not change regardless of what definition of a POSA were used.  (Tr. at 216:20- 22 (Fadem); \nTr. at 287:7 -14 (Chambliss) ; 645:24- 647:1  (Williams )). \n38. Dr. Rastogi  (PTX -555), Dr. Myers (Tr. at 142:24- 144:4 ),7 Dr. Fadem (Tr. at 216:2 -\n19), Dr. Chambliss (Tr. at 287:15- 17), and Dr. Williams  (Tr. at 644:4 -19, 645:24- 646:18) meet the \ndefinitions of a POSA  offered by both sides . \n \n7  Teva asserts that Plaintiffs made no \u201cshowing or attempt to qualify Dr. Myers\u201d as a POSA \nat trial.  (D.I. 309 at 8, n.8).  The evidence shows that Dr. Myers has a Ph.D. in organic \nchemistry and more than ten years of experience in analyzing pharmaceutical formulation s. 10 F. Facts Relevant to Infringement  \n1. Teva\u2019s ANDA Product8 \n39. Teva\u2019s  sucroferric oxyhydroxide  ANDA product is a phosphate binder indicated \nfor the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. \n(DTX -152 at 2).  The package insert instructs healthcare professionals to administer Teva\u2019s ANDA \nproduct as a phosphate binder to control serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis ( i.e., hyperphosphatemia).  (DTX -152 at 2). \n40. Teva\u2019s ANDA product is a chewable tablet, which is a dosage form capable of \ndisintegration in the oral cavity in the form of a chewable tablet.   (D.I. 277, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  20-21; DTX -\n152 at 1, 5).  \n41. Teva represented to the FDA that its ANDA product \u201cis deemed therapeutically \nequivalent to Velphoro\n\u00ae.\u201d  (DTX -171 at 28; Tr. at 99:4-17).9  It represented that its ANDA product \ncontains \u201cthe same active ingredients . . . as well as the same route of admini stration, dosage and \nstrength\u201d and \u201cwas demonstrated to be comparable to Velphoro\u00ae.\u201d  (DTX -171 at 28; see also PTX -\n7; Tr. at 97:12-23).   \n \n(PTX -603).  This is consistent with Dr. Myers \u2019 testimony that he is a person of ordinary \nskill in the art.  ( See Tr. 186:15-16). \n \n8  Teva\u2019s ANDA product will be manufactured at Watson Pharma Private Ltd., which is a \npart of Teva.   (DTX -171 at 66; PTX -7 at 1). \n \n9  The FDA defines \u201cbioequivalence \u201d as \u201cthe absence of a significant difference in the rate \nand extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar d ose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study.\u201d  \n21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.3(b). 11 42. Teva submitted an in -vitro bioequivalence equilibrium binding and in -vitro \nbioequivalence kinetic binding study in its  ANDA for the purpose of showing that its ANDA \nproduct is bioequivalent to Velphoro  in phosphate binding capacity.  (D.I. 277, Ex. 1 \u00b6 17). \n43. Based on its showing of bioequivalence to Velphoro, Teva was able to rely upon \nthe clinical studies conducted on Velphoro in its submissions to the FDA.  ( Tr. at 96:17-97:8 ). \n44. As of the date of this opinion, Teva has not received approval (tentative or final) \nfor its product.  (D.I. 321). \n2. Claims 1, 33, and 56 \n45. Teva does not contest that its ANDA p roduct includes each limitation of unasserted \nclaim 1 of the \u2019251 patent (from which asserted claims 29, 30, 33, and 56 depend).  (D.I. 277, \nEx. 1 \u00b6 23). \n46. Teva does not contest that its ANDA p roduct includes the additional limitation of \nclaim 33 and Teva agrees that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of proof with respect to \ninfringement of claim 33.  (D.I. 277, Ex. 1 \u00b6 24).10 \n47. Teva does not contest that its ANDA product includes all of the limitations of claim \n56 of the \u2019251 patent and/or indirectly infringes claim 56 of the \u2019251 patent.  Teva agrees that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of proof with respect to infringement of claim 56.  (D.I. 277, Ex. 1 \u00b6 25). \n3. Claim 29 \n48. The only dispute about infringement of claim 29, which depends on claim 1, is \nwhether Teva\u2019s ANDA product meets the \u201cessentially non -bioabsorbable\u201d limitation.  \n \n10  In the Pretrial Order (D.I. 277, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 24- 25), Teva noted that its agreement was \u201csubject \nto its non- infringement defense under the reverse doctrine of equivalents.\u201d  Teva, however, \nlater dropped its reverse doctrine of equivalents defense. 12 49. The Court construed \u201cessentially non- bioabsorbable \u201d to mean \u201cupon oral \nadministration, the iron oxyhydroxide is not absorbed by the human body in a clinically significant \namount.\u201d  (D.I. 114 at 5).  \n50. Iron is potentially toxic when in the body in high amounts.  (Tr. at 104:3 -20).  There \nare two types of iron toxicity.  One is potentially fatal acute iron poisoning, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea , and bleeding.  The second is iron overload  (hemochromatosis) , which can lead \nto organ damage, especially the liver.   (Id.). \n51. Iron absorption into the body also can also affect phosphate binding capacity and \nlower the efficacy of a phosphate binder.  (T r. at 112:1 -113:20) . \n52. The proposed label for Teva\u2019s ANDA product states: \u201c[s]ince the absorption of iron \nfrom sucroferric oxyhydroxide is low  . . . the risk of systemic iron toxicity is low.\u201d   (D.I. 277, \nEx. 1 \u00b6 22). \n53. Teva\u2019s package insert states that the \u201cactive moiety of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, \npolynuclear iron (III) -oxyhydroxide (pn- FeOOH), is practically insoluble and therefore not \nabsorbed and not metabolized\u201d and \u201c[t]he active moiety, polynuclear iron (III) -oxyhydroxide, is \npractically insoluble and cannot be absorbed.\u201d  (DTX -152 at 5 -6). \n54. Teva\u2019s package insert includes a description of an iron uptake study using \nradiolabeled sucroferric oxyhydroxide drug substance in 16 chronic kidney disease patients and 8 healt hy volunteers.  The only source of radiolabeled iron in the study was sucroferric \noxyhydroxide .  (DTX- 152 at 6) .  The study reported that , in chronic kidney disease patients, the \nmedian iron uptake was 0.04% on Day 21, which is considered \u201cquite low and insignificant.\u201d   \n(Tr. at 103:17- 104:2 (discussing DTX -152 at 6) ). 13 55. Physicians rely on a drug\u2019s package insert, which contains vital information such \nas dosing, drug interactions, and warnings, to determine whether to use a drug to treat patients, \nand how to use that drug treat patients.  (Tr. at 99 :24-100:1 7, 104:21- 105:3 ).  When prescribing \ngeneric drugs, physicians expect that a generic drug behaves in the same manner as the branded \ndrug.  ( Tr. at 104:21- 105:19).  \n56. Although the clinical study of iron uptake referenced in Teva\u2019s package insert was \nconducted by Vifor using Velphoro, not the Teva ANDA product (Tr. at 103:6 -8), if the  data and \nstatement s made regarding the \u201clow and insignificant\u201d  iron uptake  were untrue as to Teva\u2019s ANDA \nproduct , that would put patient safety in jeopardy (Tr. at 101:13- 19). \n57. Teva has not informed the FDA that any statements in the package insert for its \nANDA product may be  incorrect  or doubtful .  Nor has Teva informed the FDA that it does not \nknow the level of absor ption of iron oxy -hydroxide from Teva\u2019s ANDA product or that it requires  \nadditional clinical testing to make that determination.  \n58. Additional Teva documents also indicate that the iron oxy- hydroxide in Teva\u2019s \nANDA product is not absorbed in clinically signif icant amounts.  Teva\u2019s pharmaceutical \ndevelopment report, submitted as part of its ANDA submission to the FDA, states : \n\u2022 the iron oxy- hydroxide in its ANDA product \u201cis not intended to be \nabsorbed in vivo .\u201d  (DTX -172 at 3);  \n \n\u2022 a \u201cspecial\u201d feature of the product is \u201cthe fact that [i]ron from the \nproduct is not available in soluble form to be absorbed in the [gastrointestinal tract].\u201d  (DTX -172 at 7);  \n \n\u2022 \u201csucroferric oxyhydroxide tablets are not expected to release free \niron over the GI physiology and their by [sic] avoid possibility of any adverse effects associated with high intake of iron.\u201d  (DTX -172 \nat 14) ; \n \n\u2022 that dissolution tests comparing Teva\u2019s ANDA p roduct to Velphoro \nshowed that \u201c[b]oth test and reference did not show releas e [of iron] 14 in most relevant fed state pH of GI tract\u201d and that the results were \nconsistent with other literature that \u201cindicate negligible release of iron in the [gastrointestinal tract] for absorption.\u201d   (DTX -172 at 22).  \n 59. Another Teva product development  document describes the \u201cpoor solubility and \nnonabsorbed nature\u201d of Teva\u2019s ANDA product.  (DTX- 177 at 4).  It also states that \u201c[i]ron from \nthe product is not available in soluble form to be absorbed in the [gastrointestinal tract].\u201d   (DTX-\n177 at 10).  That exhibit describes  dissolution tests that were conducted comparing Teva\u2019s ANDA \nproduct to Velphoro, which showed that \u201c[b]oth test and reference did not show release in most \nrelevant fed state pH of GI tract\u201d and that the results were consistent with o ther literature that \n\u201cindicate negligible release of iron in the [gastrointestinal tract] for absorption.\u201d  (DTX- 177 at 36). \n60. Teva\u2019s corporate representative, Hemant Mamania, confirmed the accuracy of the  \nstatements in the documents.  For example, Dr. Mamani a confirmed that Teva did not doubt that \nthe API used in Teva\u2019s ANDA product would not be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into systemic circulation  (Tr. at 61:20- 25) and that Teva relied upon the knowledge that the API used \nin Teva\u2019s ANDA product  would not be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into systemic \ncirculation in developing its formulation (Tr. at 62:1-14).  Dr. Mamania also testified that he was \naware that free iron  absorption can lead to toxicity, and a point of developing Teva\u2019s ANDA \nproduct was to avoid having free iron that can be absorbed.  ( Tr. at 74:24- 75:11). \n61. Teva\u2019s expert, Dr. Fadem , did not address or offer opinions on the statements in \nTeva\u2019s pharmaceutical  development documents .  (Tr. at 222:2 -13). \n62. The iron oxy- hydroxide in Teva\u2019s proposed ANDA product is \u201cessentially \nnonbioabsorbable\u201d  as that term has been construed by the Court .  As that is the only disputed \nelement, Teva\u2019s proposed ANDA product meets each and every element of claim 29.  15 4. Claim 30 \n63. As noted above, claim 30 depends on claim 1.  The only disputed element re garding \ninfringement of claim 30 is whether Teva\u2019s ANDA product meets the additional limitation of claim  \n30, i.e. , \u201chaving an iron release rate of below 2.5% w/w.\u201d \n64. During claim construction, the Court construed \u201ciron release rate below 2.5% w/w\u201d \nto mean \u201cthe iron release measured in water at a pH of 3 according to European Pharmacopeia \n(\u201cEP\u201d) chapter 2.9.3[11] using standard dissolution equipment and parameters as described in the \nmonograph, where iron content is analyzed by titration after 2 hours, wherein the quantity of iron dissolved after 2 hours is less than 2.5% w/w.\u201d\n12  (D.I. 114 at 7). \n65. At trial, the parties disputed whether the Court\u2019s construction requires a pH of 3  (as \nstated) or a pH of 3.0.   \n66. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Myers, was the only witness to testify about infringement of \nclaim 30.  Teva did not offer any expert or fact testimony to rebut Dr. Myers\u2019 testing, methodology or results or his understanding and application of the Court\u2019s claim construction in his infringement \nanalysis.  \n67. The \u2019251 patent refers to pH in two places :  first, referring to polymer coating, \nnoting that \u201c[s]uitable polymers . . . are soluble at pH of from about 1.2 to about 5\u201d (JTX -1 at 9:10-\n \n11  EP 2.9.3 provides guidance for instrumentation and test parameters for performing \ndissolution testing on a variety of dosage forms.  ( PTX -246; Tr. at 146:3-9). \n \n12  The \u2019251 patent describes results for \u201c[iron] release at pH 3,\u201d which was measured \u201caccording to European Pharmacopeia chapter 2.9.3 using standard dissolution equipment and parameters as described in the monograph.  The test medium is water, pH 3 was \nadjusted using hydrochloric acid.  Samples were analyzed after 2 [hours] and iron content \nanalyzed by titration.\u201d  ( JTX-1 at 14:43-53). 16 11) and second, discussing iron release testing in Example 8 and Table 9b and referring repeatedly \nto pH of 3 ( JTX-1 at 14: 40-15:20 (including Table 9(b) )). \n68. The p atentees  understood how to specify pH to a decimal place ( e.g., 1.2) when \nthey intended to do so.  The p atentees did not do so with respect to the pH of 3, instead expressing \nit as a whole number.  \n69. A POS A would understand that pH 3, expressed as a whole number  in the patent , \nwould mathematically encompass a range of 2.5 -3.4 and would understand that , if the patent \nrequired a pH to be more specific than that range,  the pH would be identified with additional \ndecimal places .  (Tr. at 16 2:7-15, 181:23- 182:6) . \n70. A POSA would further understand that measurement of the iron relea se at a pH of  3 \nis intended to simulate the fed state of the stomach, which would exist in a pH range that \nencompasses 2.5 -3.4, though almost never at a pH of exactly 3.0.  (Tr. at 150:6 -12, 162:7 -15, \n164:22- 165:2 ). \n71. Dr. Myers is the only expert who performed iron release testing consistent with the \nCourt\u2019s construction and the process detailed in the \u2019251 patent, which requires measurement in water at a pH of 3 according to EP 2.9.3 using standard dissolution equipment and para meters as \ndescribed in the monograph.  \n72. Initial testing showed that the disintegration of Teva\u2019s ANDA product tablets  \n(which occurred before dissolution)\n13 caused the pH of the medium to increase from 3 to about 6 \nbefore dissolution testing began.  (Tr. at 152:10- 153:20, 154:2- 5, 196:12- 16).  The disintegration \n \n13  Dissolution is the absorption or release of a particular analyte into the medium, which is \nquantitated.  (Tr. 153:11- 20). 17 caused the pH to change \u201cpretty much instantaneous [ly]\u201d and remained stable once dissolution \nbegan.  ( Tr. at 153:25- 154:5) . \n73. Dr. Myers used hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH before addition of the tablet to  \naccount for the effect on pH during tablet disintegration.  (Tr. at 154:15- 25; PTX -245 at 11-12).  \nAfter disintegration of Teva\u2019s ANDA Product took place, the pH of the test media  stabilized to 3. \n(Tr. at 166:24- 167:8, 184:2- 7). \n74. The pH of the test m edia was 3 when dissolution testing per EP 2.9.3 began and \nthat pH was maintained for the duration of the dissolution testing.  (Tr. at  166:24- 167:8, 184:2- 7; \n196:17- 21). \n75. The Court\u2019s claim construction of the phrase \u201ciron release rate below 2.5% w/w\u201d \ndoes not  impose a pH requirement prior to the start of dissolution testing per EP 2.9.3.  (D.I. 114 \nat 7-9). \n76. Dr. Myers conducted iron release testing on Teva\u2019s ANDA product using an \nAgilent \u201908DS dissolution instrument with a paddle configuration, which complies with the \nrequirement of an Apparatus 2 in EP 2.9.3.  (Tr. at 146:19- 147:14; PTX -246 at 5- 6; PTX -249 at 2). \n77. Dr. Myers conducted iron release testing on Teva\u2019s ANDA product by conforming \nto the standard test parameters as set forth in EP 2.9.3.  (Tr. at 148:13- 149:15; PTX -246 at  5-6; \nPTX -249 at  2).   \n78. Dr. Myers measured the iron content using titration after 2 hours in media at a pH \nof 3.  (Tr. at 149:16- 150:14).  The pH of the test media was 3 when dissolution testing per EP 3.9.2 \nbegan and that pH was  maintained for the duration of the dissolution testing.  (Tr. at 166:16-\n167:16, 184:2- 7, 195:24- 196:5, 196:17- 21). 18 79. Dr. Myers measured iron release at a pH that ranged from 3.22 to 3.28 across \n6 tablets of Teva\u2019s ANDA product, with an average pH of 3.25.  ( PTX -245 at 13- 17; Tr. at 160:5-\n20).  The 6 tested tablets of Teva\u2019s ANDA product had an average iron release rate of 1.94% w/w, \nranging from 1.51 to 2.35% w/w.  (Id.).  Each of the 6 tested tablets of Teva\u2019s ANDA product had \nan iron release rate below 2.5 % w/w.  ( Tr. at 167:9- 16; PTX -245 at 13- 17). \n80. Teva relies on two documents Plaintiffs submitted to the FDA as part of the New \nDrug Application for Velphoro to critique Dr. Myer\u2019s testing :  PTX -323 (\u201cSection 2.3 Quality \nOverall Summary 2.3.S Drug Substance  PA 21 Chewable Tablet\u201d (dated November 27, 2017) ) \nand DTX -69 (\u201c3.2.P.5.3  Validation of the Determination of Iron Release in PA21 Chewable \nTablets (PA21, Chewable  Tablets)\u201d (dated November 21, 2012) ).   \n81. Neither DTX -69 nor PTX -323 informs a POSA how to perform the iron release test \ndetailed in the \u2019251 patent, which must be measured in water at a pH of 3 according to European Pharmacopeia chapter 2.9.3. \n82. Both PTX -323 and DTX -69 specify the pH to two significant digits along with a \npermitted range:  \u201cpH 3.0 \u00b1 0.1.\u201d  (PTX -323 at 79; DTX -69 at 15).  The \u2019251 patent , in contrast, \nstates only that the pH is \u201c3\u201d after 2 hours upon iron release measurement.  (JTX -0001 at 14:40-\n15:20).  \n83. A POSA reading PTX- 323 and DTX- 69 would understand that the test methods \ndescribed in those exhibits require a pH range of \u201c3.0 +/ - 0.1,\u201d which is different from a pH range \nof 2.5- 3.4, the range encompassed by \u201cpH 3.\u201d  (Tr. at 194:4- 195:15). \n84. Additionally, EP 2.9.3 states that \u201c[a] stirring speed of between 50 r/min and \n100 r/min is  normally chosen; it must not exceed 150 r/min.\u201d  (PTX -246 at 12).  DTX -69, on the 19 other hand, requires \u201c[s]uspend[ing] the tablets (agitating speed 250 rpm for PA21 FP  . . .).\u201d  \n(DTX -69 at 15). \n85. Similarly, EP 2.9.3 restricts the dosage number to a single dosage unit in each \nvessel, instructing to \u201c[p]lace 1 dosage unit in the apparatus.\u201d  (PTX -246 at 7).   In contrast, DTX-\n69 describes the use of multiple dosage units in a vessel.  ( DTX -69 at 2 (\u201canalysing 6 samples \n(each consisting of 2 tablets)\u201d); DTX -69 at 10 (\u201cPreparations\u201d include \u201c2x4 tablets\u201d) ). \n86. A POSA reviewing PTX -323 and DTX -69 would conclude that \u201cit\u2019s not the same \ntest method\u201d as that described in the \u2019251 patent.  (Tr. at 195:9-15). \n87. Teva\u2019s ANDA product has an iron release rate of below 2.5% w/w as that term has \nbeen construed by the Court and satisfies each and every element of claim 30 o f the \u2019251 patent. \nG. Facts Rel evant to Invalidity  \n1. The Prior Art  \na. U.S. Patent No. 6,174,442 (JTX-3) \n88. U.S. Patent No. 6,174,442 ( \u201cthe \u2019442 patent \u201d) is titled \u201cA dsorbent for Phosphate \nfrom an Aqueous Medium, Production and Use of Said Adsorbent\u201d and issued on \nJanuary  16, 2001.   \n89. The \u2019442 patent \u201cis a compound patent that describes phosphate adsorbent \ncontaining beta iron hydroxide stabilized by carbohydrate and/or humic acid.\u201d   (Tr. at 654:20-24). \n90. The European equivalent to the \u2019442 patent , EP 0868125, is referenced in the \nBackground section of the \u2019251 patent .  (Tr.  at 655 :19-56:1 ; JTX -1 at 1:27-37).  The disclosure of  \nEP 0868125 is equivalent to the disclosure of the \u2019442 patent .  (Tr. at 655:19-56:1).  The \u2019251 \npatent states that EP08 68125 describes \u201cnew and effective phosphate adsorbers\u201d with \u201csuperior 20 phosphate adsorption capacity\u201d that \u201chave been shown to be efficient oral phosphate binders in the \ntreatment of hyperphosphataemia.\u201d   (JTX-1 at 1:27- 37) \n91. As the inventors of the \u2019251 patent explained  after describing EP0868125, however, \n\u201cphosphate adsorbers with high iron loadings are still not available.  Factors, such as ease of \nadministration in general, unacceptable taste, as well as storage and stability p roblems, limit the \napplicability of currently available phosphate binders.\u201d  (JTX-1 at 1:38- 44; Tr. at 656:10- 18, \n647:25- 649:8).  \n92. The \u2019442 patent does not describe any finished dosage forms.  (Tr. at 654:25-  \n655:1) .   \n93. The \u2019442 patent discloses a genus of novel phosphate adsorbents containing \nstabilized iron oxy- hydroxide.  Specifically, the \u2019442 patent discloses that \u201c[t]he object of the \npresent invention is therefore to provide adsorbents for phosphate from aqueous medium. . . . It \nhas been shown that this object can be achieved by the adsorbents for phosphate from aqueous \nmedium, to which the present invention firstly relates, which contain poly- nuclear beta- iron \nhydroxide stabilised by carbohydrates and/or by humic acid.\u201d  ( JTX-3 at 1:40- 52). \n94. The \u2019442 pate nt identifies at least twelve different potential stabilizing agents, \nincluding humic acid, amylopectin, \u201cagarose, dextran, dextrin, dextran derivatives, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, saccharose, maltose, lactose or mannitol.\u201d  (JTX-3 at 2:54 -57).  \u201cSaccharose\u201d \nand \u201csucrose\u201d are synonymous and refer to the same compound.  (See, e.g., Tr. at 390: 4-10, 400:5-\n7). \n95. The examples of the \u2019442 patent disclose embodiments of six phosphate adsorbents.  \n(JTX-3 at 3:30- 6:45; 9:29- 53). 21 96. Example 1 of the \u2019442 patent describes the bulk synthesis of 208.3 g of an iron oxy-\nhydroxide suspension, to which 15 g of saccharose and 15 g of starch were added, yielding 47.2 g \nof powder.  (JTX-3 at 3:30 -51).   \n97. Example 1 is not a finished dosage form.  (Tr. at 677:21- 25).  The material of \nExample 1 is made by rotary evaporation.  (JTX-3 at 3:45- 50).  As Dr. Williams explained, the \n\u2019442 patent Example 1 material \u201cwas concentrated at 50 degrees C in a rotary evaporator and dried \nat 40 degrees C under high vacuum \u201d based on his experience when material is \u201cdried from that \nrotary evaporator, you have to literally scrape it off the sides of the ins ide of the vessel of the rotary \nevaporator \u201d and thus would not represent a finished dosage form.  (Tr. at 67 7:21- 678:18).  The \nmaterial of Example 1 would require additional processing before it would be suitable for formulating as a finished dosage form.  ( Tr. at 678: 19-679:7). \n98. Example 2 of the \u2019442 patent measures the phosphate binding capacity of the \nmaterial prepared in Example 1 containing iron oxy- hydroxide, starch, and sucrose for inorganic \nphosphate.  ( JTX-3 at 3:53- 4:13, as recorded in Table 1) . \n99. Example 6 of the \u2019442 patent describes the bulk synthesis of a powder consisting \nof 30.0 g saccharose added to the suspension of Example 1 consisting of 208.3 g iron oxy-hydroxide.  ( JTX-3 at 5:24 -30).  Phosphate binding data for the Example 6 formulation is  provided \nin Table 5.  (JTX-3 at 5:33 -44).  The Example 6 material had the best phosphate binding capacity \nof any of the stabilized iron oxy- hydroxides disclosed in the \u2019442 patent.  (Tr. at 663:1- 5; JTX-3 \nat 5:3 3-44). \n100. Example 7 of the \u2019442 patent describes the bulk synthesis of a powder consisting \nof 30.0 g amylopectin added to the suspension of Example 1 consisting of 208.3 g iron oxy-\nhydroxide.  ( JTX-3 at 5:44- 50).  Phosphate binding data for Example 7 is provided in Table 6.  22 101. Example 8 of the \u2019442 patent describes the bulk synthesis of a powder consisting \nof only iron oxy -hydroxide and white dextrin.  (JTX-3 at 5:64- 6:5).  Phosphate binding data for \nthe Example 8 formulation is provided in Table 7.  (JTX-3 at 6:6 -17).  Example 8 had the second \nbest phosphate adsorption data in the \u2019442 patent.  (Tr. at 663:6- 15; JTX -3 at 6:6 -17). \n102. A POSA would understand from this data that Examples 6 (sucrose) and 8 (dextrin) \nhave the best phosphate binding capacity.  ( Tr. at 399:11- 20, 663:1- 15). \n103. The only stabilizers claimed in the \u2019442 patent are dextrin and sucrose.  \nSpecifically, claim 7 is directed to \u201c [a] process according to claim 2, wherein the carbohydrate \ncomprises saccharose or dextrin or a mixture thereof.\u201d  (JTX-3 at 12:1- 2).  The in ventors of the \n\u2019442 patent did not specifically claim the combination of starch and sucrose as used in Example 1.  \n(JTX-3 at 10:36- 12:24) . \n104. A POSA reading the \u2019442 patent in its entirety would understand that the \u2019442 \ninventors considered the disclosed phos phate binders stabilized with sucrose (Example 6) and \ndextrin (Example 8) to be the most promising active ingredients for development into a complete \nformulation.  ( Tr. at 663: 1-664:16, see also Tr. at 411:2- 12, 399:11- 20; 391:20- 392:9). \n105. The \u2019442 patent contains a generic teaching applicable to all of the stabilized iron \noxy-hydroxides described that the novel stabilized iron oxy- hydroxides described can be \n\u201cformulated for oral application . . . They can be formulated as such or together with customary drug additives, such as customary carriers or auxiliary materials.\u201d   (JTX-3 at 3:9 -13).  Also, \n\u201c[e]ncapsulation may be effected\u201d or \u201cthe adsorbents\u201d may be provided \u201ctogether with auxiliary materials and additives, as granules, tablets, dragees or contained in sachets.\u201d  (Id.).  Because the \n\u2019442 patent refers general ly to \u201c[t]he adsorbents according to the invention\u201d in that statement, a 23 POSA would understand that this disclosure refers to all of the stabilized iron oxy-hydroxides \ndisclosed in the \u2019442 patent, not just Example 1.  ( Tr. at 392:23-393:8). \nb. Hergesell (JTX -7) \n106. In 1999, Hergesell and Rich published an article titled \u201cStabilized poly nuclear  iron \nhydroxide is an efficient oral phosphate binder in uraemic patients \u201d in Nephrology Dialysis \nTranspla ntation  (\u201cHergesell\u201d).  ( JTX-7). \n107. The \u2019251 patent discusses Hergesell.  ( JTX-1 at 1:31-37; Tr. at 656:2-9).  In the \nparagraph immediately following that discussion, the \u2019251 patent states  that \u201cphosphate adsorbers \nwith high iron loadings are still not available.  Factors, such as ease of administration in general, \nunacceptable taste, as well as storage and stability problems, limit the applicability of currently available phosphate binders .\u201d  (JTX-1 at 1:38-44; Tr. at 656:10-18). \n108. Hergesell describes an open uncontrolled study of the efficacy and tolerability of \n\u201cstabilized polynuclear iron hydroxide.\u201d  (JTX-7).  Hergesell discloses that a \u201cstabilized \npolynuclear iron hydroxide\u201d of the chemi cal formula  \u201c[FeO\n2/3(OH) 5/3H2O l/m(C 6H10O5)m]n\u201d \n\u201cappears to be a promising, new compound which has remarkable in vitro binding capacity for phosphate compared to the cross -linked iron Dextran.\u201d  ( JTX-7 at 1; Tr.  at 402:4-16).  Aside from \nthis chemical formula, Hergesell does not provide any other details about the \u201cstabilized \npolynuclear iron hydroxide\u201d used in the clinical study.  ( JTX-7). \n109. The POSA \u201chaving looked at the \u2019442 Patent, and Hergesell sees that Hergesell \ndiscloses  that there are promising compounds that have remarkable in vitro binding capacity\u201d and \n\u201cthey would also see that they were given a formula with respect to the promising new compound.\u201d (Tr. at 402:12-19). 24 110. The chemical formula in Hergesell (\u201c[FeO 2/3(OH) 5/3H2O l/m(C 6H10O5)m]n\u201d) \ncontains \u201ctwo different chemical compounds,\u201d one on the left and one on the right, and the \nchemical compound on the right is \u201c( C6H10O5)m.\u201d  (JTX-7 at 1; Tr.  at 403:8- 404:11).  \n111. C6H10O5 is consistent with starch, amylopectin and dextrin.  ( Tr. at 404:12 -405:6, \n406:25- 407:2) .  Amylopectin and dextrin are the stabilizers used in Examples 7 and 8 of the \u2019442 \npatent.  ( JTX-3 at 5:44- 50, 5:64- 6:5; Tr.  at 405:15- 17, 407:3- 10). \n112. In describing \u201cstabilized polynuclear iron hydroxide,\u201d Herge sell cites DE 195 47 \n356 A1 (designated as footnote 13).  ( JTX-7 at 1, 4) . \n113. DE 195 47 356 A1 is the German patent application to which the \u2019442 patent claims \npriority.  ( Tr. at 307:1- 6). \n114. The chemical formula C 6H10O5 is not consistent with sucrose or sacchar ose.  (Tr. at \n668:2- 5).  The chemical formula for saccharose is C 12H22O11.  (Tr. at 409:12- 15). \n115. Hergesell does not disclose the chemical formula C 12H22O11 (saccharose) .  (Tr. at \n409:16- 18).  There is no disclosure of saccharose in Hergesell.  ( Tr. at 409:19- 21). \n116. The components of the \u201cstabilized polynuclear iron hydroxide\u201d in the chemical \nformula in Hergesell are consistent with Examples 7 and 8 of the \u2019442 patent but not consistent with the components for sucroferric oxy- hydroxide (described in Example 1 of the \u2019442 patent).  \n(See 404:12- 25, 405:15- 23, 407:3- 10, 668:2- 5, 672:22- 673:9) . \n117. Hergesell discloses that \u201cpowder in pre -weighed sachets were provided to patients\u201d \n(Tr. at 68 5:21- 668:1) and that patients were \u201cgiven a constant dose of 3 x 2.5 g stabilized \npolynuclear iron hydroxide\u201d  (JTX-7 at 2).   From this disclosure, however, \u201cit\u2019s just not clear\u201d how \n\u201cmuch of the stabilized polynuclear iron oxyhydroxide is contained in each preweighed sachet.\u201d  \n(Tr. at 686: 2-15; JTX -7 at 2).   25 c. U.S. Patent No. 4,970,079 (\u201cthe \u2019079 patent\u201d) (JTX-5) \n118. The \u2019079 patent is titled \u201cMethod and composition of oxy -iron compounds for \ntreatment of hyperphosphatemia\u201d and issued on November 13, 1990.  ( JTX-5 at 1). \n119. The \u2019079 patent discloses \u201cthree types of oxy- iron compounds . . . iron oxides, iron \nhydroxide and iron oxyhydroxides.\u201d  ( Tr. at 686:19- 23; JTX -5 at 3:12-14).  The \u2019079 patent \ndiscloses \u201c500 mg or more\u201d of such compounds.  ( JTX-5 at 3:52-55; Tr.  at 68 6:24-687:10). \n120. The foreign equivalent to the \u2019079 patent is referenced in the Background section \nof the \u2019251 patent.  ( Tr. at 657: 13-19; JTX -1 at 2:4 -18).  There, the  \u2019251 patent states that \u201c[n]o \nspecific oral formulations are disclosed\u201d in the \u2019079 patent, that \u201cno specific iron loading is \nmentioned\u201d and that , although there is a disclosure that \u201ceach oral dose may contain 50 mg to \nabout 500 mg or more of oxy- iron compound,\u201d \u201c [a]ccording to the state of the art tablets containing \n500 mg oxyiron compounds  . . . would be of such an enormous size that they could not be \nswallowed by the patient.\u201d  ( JTX-1 at 2:4-18; Tr.  at 657:20-658:6). \n121. \u201cThe \u2019079 patent relates to unstabilized oxy -iron compounds.  In the \u2019079 patent , \nthere is no disclosure of stabilized iron oxyhydroxide and there is no specific disclosure of how to \nformulate and make finished dosage forms.\u201d  ( Tr. at 656:19-657:2). \n122. The \u2019079 patent also teaches that \u201ceach oral dose of the therapeutic oxy -iron \ncontaining composition in accordance with this invention can contain from about 50 milligrams to \nabout 500 milligrams or more of oxy- iron compound\u201d and that the \u201camount of oxy- iron compound \nto be administered will depend on the severity of the patient\u2019s condition, the nature of the patient\u2019s diet, and the surface area and phosphate binding capacity of the specific oxy-iron compound used in the formulation.\u201d  ( Tr. at 686:24-687:10). 26 123. The \u2019079 patent also discloses that \u201ca 174- milligram dose of ferrihydrite can absorb \nthe same amount of phosphate of ten mil as . . . Amphogel w hich is a commercially available \naluminum hydroxide product.  And it mentions a tablet or capsule containing 174 milligrams of \nsynthetic ferrihydrite.\u201d  (Tr. at 687:11- 688:2).  However, \u201c the \u2019079 [patent] does not give any \ndetails how to formulate a composi tion that contains 174 milligrams of ferrihydite [sic: \nferrihydrite] or a method of how to make a composition.\u201d   (Tr. at 688: 3-8). \n124. The only disclosure in the \u2019079 patent regarding how to formulate tablets or \ncapsules containing the oxy- iron compounds is a single passage that states \u201cmethods and excipients \nfor preparation of both gel and solid dosage forms are well -known in the art.\u201d  (Tr. at 688: 19- \n689:2).  \u201c[T]hat\u2019s [] a  really general statement\u201d that \u201cdoesn \u2019t really tell a POSA how specifically \nto formulate or make dosage forms of the oxy -iron compounds of this invention.\u201d  (Tr. at 689:2-\n5). \n125. The \u2019079 patent does not give any specific details about how to formulate a \ncomp osition that contains 174 milligrams of ferrihydrite or a method of how to make a \ncomposition.  ( Tr. at 688:3- 8). \n126. The \u2019079 patent claims \u201c[a] therapeutic composition in oral dosage form for \ncontrolling serum phosphate in patients having need for reduced absorption of dietary phosphate, \nsaid composition comprising on a per dose basis from about 50 mg to about 500 mg of an oxyiron compound selected from the group consisting of iron oxides, iron oxyhydroxides, and iron hydroxides, and a pharmaceutically accept able excipient for said oral dosage form.\u201d   (JTX-5 at \n7:18- 8:2). 27 2. Obviousness of the Asserted Claims Based on the \u2019442 Patent Alone \n127. Independent c laims 1 and 27 of the \u2019251 p atent both require \u201cwherein the amount \nof iron oxy- hydroxide per dosage form is at least 500 mg.\u201d  Each a sserted claim is dependent on \neither claim 1 or 27 and, thus, incorporate by reference the \u201cwherein the amount of iron oxy-\nhydroxide per dosage form is  at least 500 mg\u201d  limitation.  ( FF \u00b6\u00b6 21-28).  Claims 29, 30, and 33 \nof the \u2019251 patent require a \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d with \u201cat least 500 mg\u201d of iron oxy-\nhydroxide \u201cper dosage form\u201d while claim 56  \u2013 which is dependent on c laim 2 7 \u2013 further requires \na higher amount of \u201cabout 800 mg iron oxy- hydroxide per dosage form.\u201d  ( Id.).  Thus, all asserted \nclaims require a \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d with \u201cat least 500 mg\u201d of iron oxy- hydroxide \u201cper \ndosage form.\u201d  ( Id.). \n128. A POSA would not have been motivated to make a single dosage form with at least \n500 mg or about 800 mg of iron oxy-hydroxide based on the disclosure of the \u2019442 patent.  ( Tr. at \n697:4-12). \n129. The \u2019442 patent does not disclose any complete pharmaceutical compositions, let \nalone any high loaded compositions.  ( See Tr.  at 654:25-655:1). \n130. Example 1 describes the bulk synthesis of 47.2 g of SFO.  ( JTX-3 at 3:45-50).  Thus, \na POSA attempting to formulate Example 1 would need to select the amount of iron oxyhydroxide to include per dosage form.  ( See Tr.  at 679:17-22). \n131. \u201cThere is no discussion in Example 1 about how much iron oxyhydroxide from the \npowder that\u2019s been produced should be loaded in a final dosage form.\u201d  ( Tr. at 679:20-22). \n132. The \u2019442 patent generically discloses that \u201c[t]he daily dose of the adsorbents \naccording to the invention is, for example, 1 to 3 g, preferably about 1.5 g of iron.\u201d  ( JTX-3 at \n3:19-21).  A POSA would understand that this disclosure is directed to the entire class of disclosed 28 stabilized iron oxy -hydroxide compounds.  (See Tr. at 392:23- 393:8) .  500 mg of iron corresponds \nto 800 mg of iron oxyhydroxide.  ( See FF \u00b6  32). \n133. Applying the generic di sclosure of a preferred \u201cdaily dose\u201d of \u201c1.5 g of iron\u201d (JTX -\n3 at 3:19- 21) to all of the Examples would result in significantly different phosphate binding \ncapacities at that single preferred daily dose.  The Examples have different phosphate binding \ncapacities  \u2013 ranging from 100% to 69% at pH 3 and 100% to 65% at pH 5.5.  (JTX-3 at 4:1 -13, \n5:33- 44, 5:52- 63, 6:6- 17, 6:32- 44, 9:40- 52; Tr. at 662:19- 663:21) .  This means that a 1.5 g daily \ndose of Example 8 would have about 30% more phosphate binding capacity than a 1.5 g daily dose of Example 7.  \n134. As Dr. Williams explained, the determination of the correct dose is determined \nduring pre -formulation testing and is  based on a number of factors, which would likely require \ntesting and input from a physician.  (Tr. at 659:11- 660:3, 685:3- 15; DTX -1006 at 4, 12).  The \u2019442 \npatent does not provide this information.  ( Tr. at 685:16- 20). \n135. Dr. Rastogi, a physician, explained tha t administering high doses of iron is  \nparticularly challenging because it can cause gastrointestinal irritation.  (Tr. at 512:24- 513:3;  see \nalso JTX -1 at 2:49- 53). \n136. For example, iron compositions \u201cmore often than not cause[] gastrointestinal \nproblems,\u201d and 500 mg per dose is significantly higher than the \u201cnormal requirement [of] one milligram per day absorption of iron.\u201d  ( Tr. at 513:1- 6). \n137. The \u2019442 patent provides no teaching about the number of administrations per day \nfor the preferred daily dose.  (Tr. at 680:9- 680:16, 684:6- 20).  Rather, a POSA would understand \nthis \u201cto refer to the total daily dose\u201d and would understand that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t provide guidance to a 29 POSA on . . . how to subdivide it into dosage forms.  It just doesn\u2019t give that information.\u201d  (Tr. at \n680:12- 16). \n138. The \u2019442 patent teaches generally in claim 12 that the claimed phosphate binders \nshould be taken \u201csimultaneously with intake of food.\u201d  (JTX-3 at 12:13- 17).  That does not inform \na POSA of the number of administrations per day.  (See Tr.  at 684: 9-20). \n139. As Dr. Williams explained, a POSA would understand this teaching to mean \nexactly what it is says  \u2013 i.e., \u201ctake the stabilized polynuclear beta iron oxyhydroxide when they \neat food.\u201d  (Tr. at 684:12 -14). \n140. There is nothing in the \u2019442 patent disclosure that equates ingesting food at regular \nmeals, let alone three meals per day.   Dr. Fadem acknowledged that patients take phosphate binders \nnot just with meals but with some snacks as well.  (Tr. at 733:3- 734:4) . \n141. The labels for other phosphate binders do not establish \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d among \nPOSAs that phosphate binders are administered three times a day.  First, a POSA would not look \nto the dosing regimens of non- iron based  phosphate binders when seeking to formulate the \nstabilized iron oxy- hydroxide binders described in the \u2019442 patent.  (Tr. at 696:1- 20).  Second, \nthree of the four labels on which Teva relies are not prior art.  These three labels have revisio n \ndates of 2011 \u2013 years after the 2007 filing of the priority application to the  \u2019251 patent.  (PTX -217 \nat 1, PTX -544 at 1, PTX -211 at 1).  Two of the four labels upon which Teva  relies state that the \ndosage and administration information was changed in 2009 and 2011, respectively.  (PTX -217 at \n1; PTX -544 at 1) .   \n142. Third, even if a POSA did rely on those labels, they show that phosphate binders  \nfrequently have multiple doses that depend on a number of patient -specific factors.  (PTX -217 at \n1-3; PTX -544 at 1-2; PTX 211 at 1-2; PTX -214 at 1-3; DTX- 120 at 1-3; Tr. at 722:15- 723:9) .  For 30 example, Renagel \u00ae was administered as up to five tablets per administration .  (PTX -214 at 1-3). \nSimilarly, even sachets and oral suspensions required multiple dosage forms  \u2013 the 1.6 g starting \ndose for Renvela \u00ae was administered as two 0.8 g sachets.  (Tr. at 722:15- 723:9; DTX -120 at 1; \nPTX -217 at 1).  Additionally, PhoslyraTM was administered as two 5 ml oral suspensions.  (PTX -\n211 at 1) . \n143. As Dr. Williams explained, once the appropriate dose is set, a POSA still needs to \ndetermine whether it can be delivered in a single dosage form, and the \u2019442 patent provides no \ninformation a bout these formulation considerations.  (Tr. at 685:3- 20).  For example, once a POSA \ndetermines the correct dose administration, the POSA would then consider a number of formulation factors to determine if that dose can be formulate d in a single dosage uni t or whether \nthe dose needs to be divided among multiple dosage units.  ( Id).  The \u2019442 patent \u201cdoesn\u2019t give [] \ninformation\u201d about whether \u201cit\u2019s possible to load any given amount of iron oxyhydroxide [into] a \ngiven dosage form.\u201d  ( Id.). \n144. A POSA would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in formulating a \nhigh loaded composition with \u201cat lea st 500 mg\u201d or \u201cabout 800 mg\u201d of iron oxy- hydroxide per \ndosage form.  ( Tr. at 697:13- 18). \n145. Thus, a POSA would not have had reason to believe that a single dose containing \n500 or 800 mg iron oxy- hydroxide would be successful as a pharmaceutical formulation.  (See \nTr. at 512:13- 513:19 (noting that compressing 500 milligrams of iron in a small tablet is \n\u201cremarkable,\u201d particularly given the \u201cvery minimal\u201d gastrointestinal adverse events ); 697:13- 18). 31 3. Obviousness of the Asserted Claims B ased on the \u2019442 Patent in \nCombination with O ther P rior A rt  \n \n146. Teva relies on one or more of Hergesell and the \u2019079 patent in combination with \nthe \u2019442 patent to argue that a combination of prior art references render the \u201cwherein the amount \nof iron oxy- hydroxide per dosage form is a t least 500 mg\u201d limitation of the a sserted claims obvious. \n147. The Hergesell reference and  \u2019079 patent do not teach or suggest the limitations that \nare not disclosed in or rendered obvious by the \u2019442 patent.   \n148. None of the other cited prior art references contain any specific pre -formulation \ndata related to sucroferric oxyhydroxide.  ( Tr. at 660: 4-17).  Moreover, none of the other cited \nprior art references contain any pre -formulation data related to any of the s tabilized polynuclear \niron oxyhydroxides described in the \u2019442 patent generally.  ( Tr. at 660:18-661:2).   \n149. Aside from the \u2019442 patent, Hergesell is the only prior art reference Teva relies on \nthat discusses stabilized iron oxy-hydroxide.  ( Tr. at 677:8-14). \na. The Relationship Between the \u2019442 Patent and Hergesell  \n150. Dr. Chambliss testified  that \u201c[a]s a formulator, you would start with the \u2019442 Patent \nand then you would look to see if there is any other publications out there which use that material, and you would find Hergesell.  And Hergesell then directs you back to the \u2019442 Patent.  So they\u2019re \nvery tightly tied together.\u201d   (Tr. at 306:1-5) .  Accordingly, a POSA reviewing the \u2019442 patent \nwould also review and consider the disclosure in Hergesell. \n151. Hergesell  explicitly references the German priority application that corresponds to \nthe \u2019442 patent.  ( JTX-7 at 1; see also Tr.  at 307:1-6). \n152. Hergesell states that a \u201cstabilized polynuclear iron hydroxide\u201d having the chemical \nformula \u201c[FeO\n2/3(OH) 5/3H2O l/m(C 6H10O5)m]n\u201d \u201cappears to be a promising, new compound which 32 has remarkable in vitro binding capacity for phosphate compared to the crosslinked iron dextran.\u201d  \n(JTX-7 at 1; Tr.  at 402:4- 16). \n153. The POSA \u201chaving looked at the \u2019442 Patent, and Hergesell sees that Hergese ll \ndiscloses that there are promising compounds that have remarkable in vitro  binding capacity\u201d and \n\u201cthey would also see that they were given a formula with respect to the promising new compound.\u201d  \n(Tr. at 402:12- 19). \n154. Dr. Chambliss agreed that the chemical  formula on the first page of Hergesell \ndescribes two different chemical compounds  \u2013 FeO 2/3(OH) 5/3H2O and C 6H10O5.  (Tr. at 403:18-\n404:11) . \n155. Dr. Chambliss acknowledged that the formula (C 6H10O5)m is consistent with \namylopectin and dextrin.  (Tr. at 405:3- 6; 406:25- 407:2) .  Amyolpectin and dextrin are the \nstabilizers used in Examples 7 and 8 of the \u2019442 patent.  ( Tr. at 405:15- 17; 407:3- 10). \n156. Dr. Chambliss a lso acknowledged that the Hergesell chemical formula is not \nconsistent with sucrose  (saccharose)  and that there is no disclosure of sucrose anywhere in \nHergesell.  (Tr. at 409:12- 21; 410:19- 25).  Thus, the chemical formula in Hergesell is not \nconsistent with Example 1 of the \u2019442 patent.  \n157. Because t he Hergesell formula does not include sucrose and is inconsistent with \nExample 1 of the \u2019442 patent, it would lead a POSA away from selecting Example 1 as the active \ningredient for formulation development.  \n158. A POSA would not discount the Hergesell formula be cause its description of the \niron-based compound is, according to Teva, \u201cnon- standard and erroneous.\u201d  Dr. Chambliss a greed \nthat he could understand the right side of the formula and that it describes a carbohydrate.  (Tr. at \n403:8- 405:2). 33 b. The \u2019442 Patent in combination with Hergesell  and the \u2019079 \nPatent do not teach or suggest \u201cwherein the amount of iron oxy-\nhydroxide per dosage form is at least 500 mg\u201d  \n \n159. Teva contends that the \u2019079 patent and Hergesell provide motivation for a POSA \nto make a formulation with at least 500 mg or about 800 mg of s ucroferric oxyhydroxide per \ndosage form.  Neither reference motivate s a POSA to include 500 mg or 800 mg of iron oxy-\nhydroxide in a single dosage form. \n160. The \u2019079 patent discloses \u201cthree types of oxy- iron compounds . .  . iron oxides, iron \nhydroxide and iron oxyhydroxides.\u201d  (JTX-5 at 3:12-14; Tr. at 686:19-23).  The \u2019079 patent \ndiscloses \u201c500 mg or more\u201d of such compounds.  ( JTX-5 at 3:52-55; Tr. at 686:24-687:10).  T he \n\u2019079 patent, however,  does not disclose any finished dosage formulations, nor does it teach how \nto formulate the disclosed iron oxy compounds.  ( Tr. at 688:9-689:5). \n161. The \u2019079 patent also teaches that 174 mg of iron oxy compound is as effective in \nadsorbing phosphate as the commercially  available aluminum h ydroxide product and mentions a \ntablet or capsule containing 174 milligrams of iron oxy compound.  ( Tr. at 687:14-688:2). \n162. However, \u201c[t]he \u2019079 [patent] does not give any details about specifically how to \nformulate a c omposition that contains 174 milligrams of ferrihyd [rite] or a method of how to make \na composition.\u201d  ( Tr. at 688:3- 8). \n163. Hergesell discloses that \u201cpowder in pre -weighed sachets were provided to patients\u201d \n(Tr. at 685:21- 686:1) and that patients were \u201cgiven a constant dose of 3 x 2.5 g stabilized \npolynuclear iron hydroxide \u201d (JTX-7 at 2).  From this disclosure, it is not clear how much powder \nis contained in each sachet.  ( Tr. at 686:2- 7).  It is also not clear \u201chow much of the stabilized \npolynuclear iron oxyhydroxide is contained in each pre- weighed sachet.\u201d  ( Tr. at 686:8-15). 34 4. Objective Indicia of Nonobviousness  \na. Long Felt But Unmet Need  \n164. The search for safe and effective phosphate binders began in the 1970s.  (Tr. at  \n507:8-18).  \n165. Aluminum- based binders were the first binders that were widely used for treating \nhyperphosphatemia.  (Tr. at 493:21- 25).  Aluminum -based binders were effective but could be \ntoxic because the aluminum is absorbed into the body.  (Tr. at 494: 15-17).  This risk of aluminum \ntoxicity led to discontinuation of widespread use  of aluminum -based binders.  ( DTX-1019 at 3-4). \n166. In the 1990s, calcium -based binders began to be used as a replacement for  \naluminum- based binders .  (Tr. at 497:21-498:18; DTX-1019 a t 5).  Calcium -based binders, \nhowever, are also associated with adverse events including  hypercalcemia, vascular calcification , \nand bone disease resulting from the systemic absorption of  calcium.  (Tr. at 498:24-499:2-16; \nDTX-1019 at 5).  As of at least 2014, the medical field was warned that calcium -based binders  \nshould be avoided altogether.  (Tr. at 499:17-24; DTX-1019 at 5; PTX -446 at 31). \n167. Sevelamer -based binders are nonmetal binders in the class of polymers.  (Tr. at \n502:3- 13).  These binders a re safe but not very effective so they must be  administered in very large \npills.  (Tr. at 502:24-504:5).  The large pills can result in poor patient compliance  and poor \ntherapeutic outcomes.  ( Id.). \n168. Lanthanum- based binders are metal -based.  ( Tr. at 504: 7-505:3).  Lanthanum- based \nbinders are more effective than calcium and sevelamer but , as warned on package insert s, \nlanthanum is difficult to chew and can result in broken teeth, which actually led to noncompliance \nand discontinuation.  ( Id.; PTX -544 at 1-3). 35 169. Aluminum- based, calcium -based, sevelamer -based , and lanthanum -based binders \neach failed to  satisfy the need for a safe, effective, and tolerable binder.  (Tr. at 506:16-507:1). \n170. Velphoro satisfied the long- felt need for a safe, effective, and tolerable binder.   \n(Tr. at 507:2- 4). \n171. Velphoro was able to get patients to their goal serum phosphate levels  through \nadministration of a reasonably sized, easy -to-chew tablet with a low pill burden , all of which are \nimportant for long- term compliance  and eff icacy .  (Tr. at 508:20-509: 21, 511: 6-23; DTX -1020 at \n2). \n172. Despite being a metal -based binder, Velphoro was safe due to little to no systemic \nbioabsorption and thus, no iron toxicity.  (Tr. at 508:14-18). \nb. Commercial Success  \n173. Velphoro has substantial revenues from its sales in the United States since launch \nto September 2019, achieving net sales of approximately $481 million.  (Tr. at 566:10-20). \n174. Velphoro\u2019s sales have grown rapidly from about $15 million in the partial year \n2014, the year  of launch, to $135 million in annual sales through September 2019.  That growth \nreflects a compound annual growth rate of about 35%.  ( Id.; DTX -313-F at 1; DTX-697). \n175. These sales provide evidence of marketplace success.  (Tr. at 567:2- 4). \n176. Velphoro competes more closely with calcium- free binders when compared to  \ncalcium -based binders.  ( Tr. at 569:2-12, 616:8-617:2; DTX-493, DTX-879, DTX-836). \n177. Velphoro\u2019s share of the calcium -free segment rose from just under 2% in the year \nof launch to 11.8% in September 2019.  (Tr. at 569:22- 570:19, 575:25- 576:10).  Velphoro\u2019s shares \nof prescriptions in the  calcium -based binder market shows a similar growth pattern and similar \ntrajectory, rising to  8% in September 2019.  ( Tr. at  575:25-576:10; DTX-697; DTX-313-M at 1). 36 178. Velphoro\u2019s market is characterized by competition among branded and generic  \npharmaceutical products.  ( Tr. at 571:7-23).  Generic products have substantially lower prices. \n(Id.). \n179. Velphoro was a late entrant to a relatively crowded field of phosphate binders,  \nincluding both generic and branded competitors.  (Tr. at 573:3-13).  B eing a late entrant results in \nmore  limited market uptake than one would expect if one was an early entrant.  (Tr. at 574:9-18).   \n180. The market place success of Velphoro based on its ability to penetrate the market \ndespite being a late entrant and in the face of significant generic  competition provides further \nconfirmation of its success in the marketplace.  (Tr. at 575:3-11). \nc. Blocking Patent \n181. Teva asserts that the \u2019442 patent is a \u201cblocking patent, which disincentivized others \nfrom developing the alleged invention\u201d and \u201cfurther limits\u201d the asserted objective indicia .  \n(D.I.  299 at 27- 28).  \n182. The claims of the \u2019442 patent are limited to the beta for m of sucroferric \noxyhydroxide, and thus the \u2019442 patent would block entry in the marketplace with respect to only \nthe beta form.  ( Tr. at  749:23-750:2, 634:11-14; JTX -3 at claim 1 ). \n183. In contrast, the \u2019251 patent includes other forms of the active  ingredient, including \nalpha and gamma.   (Tr. at 634:15-21; JTX -1 at claim 1  et al ). \n184. Teva offered no evidence that those in the industry were prevented from  practicing \nthe \u2019251 patent due to the \u2019442 patent. \n5. Enablement of Claims 29 and 30 \n185. Claim 29 requires the \u201ccomposition according to claim 1, wherein the iron \noxyhydroxide is essentially non-bioabsorbable.\u201d  ( JTX-1 at 17:18-19). 37 186. The Court construed \u201cessentially non- bioabsorbable\u201d to mean \u201c[u]pon oral \nadministration, the iron oxyhydroxide is not absorbed by the human body in a c linically significant \namount.\u201d  ( D.I. 114 at 5). \n187. A clinician would understand that \u201cclinically significant \u201d means that \u201cthere is an \neffect of the drug . . . that changes the practice.  And if there is iron absorption that it would change \nthe way this drug is used and that\u2019s why the prescribing information is very important.\u201d  (Tr. at \n107:21- 108:11) .   \n188. Dr. Rastogi gave an example of an iron uptake amount that was \u201cquite low and \ninsignificant\u201d  \u2013 0.04%.  (Tr. at 103:17- 104:2).  He also gave an example of a drug with clinically \nsignificant iron release  \u2013 \u201c[i]f you \u2019re given a drug like Auryxia, you would expect the ir on to be \nabsorbed, not the iron levels to go down.\u201d  ( Tr. at 135:10- 12). \n189. A POSA would understand that clinical significance is determined by looking at \nthe averages across the patient population, not any outcome for an individual patient.  (Tr. at 134:1-\n136:3). \n190. A POSA, following the disclosure in the \u2019251 patent, could generate the claimed \ncompositions that are essentially non- bioabsorbable without undue experimentation.  The \u2019251 \npatent provides numerous working examples of complete formulations, including chewable tablets \nwith iron release rate as low as 0.2% (product 8g).  (JTX-1 at 14:1- 15:20) .  Dr. Chambliss \nexplained that iron release rate and bioabsorbability go \u201chand in hand\u201d such that if iron release is \nhigher, the absorption is higher.  (Tr. at 300:20- 24).  Thus, a POSA would understand that the \ntablets taught in the working examples of the \u2019251 patent would be expected to be non-\nbioabsorbable.  In addition, Example 2b is very similar to the formulation of Velphoro, a 38 formulation that has been shown to be essentially non- bioabsorbable.  (JTX-1 at 12:39- 60; PTX -\n322 at 10) . \n191. The \u2019251 patent also provides guidance about manufacturing techniques that should \nbe avoided in order to prevent the release of iron.  (JTX-1 at 8:30- 33, 10:5- 9). \n192. Claim 30 requires the \u201ccomposition according to claim 1, having an iron release \nrate of below  2.5% w/w.\u201d  ( JTX-1 at 17:20- 21). \n193. The Court construed \u201ciron release rate below 2.5%\u201d to mean \u201c[t]he iron release \nmeasured in water at a pH of 3 according w/w to European Pharmacopeia chapter 2.9.3 using \nstandard dissolution equipment and parameters as desc ribed in the monograph, where iron content \nis analyzed by titration after 2 hours, wherein the quantity of iron dissolved after 2 hours is less than 2.5% w/w.\u201d   (D.I. 11 4 at 7) . \n194. The \u2019251 patent teaches that \u201c[t]he inventive compositions have a low iron rel ease \nrate of below 2.5% w/w, which is essential for phosphate adsorbers. In contrast thereto, \ncompositions used for treating iron deficiency have a high iron release rate and thus are completely different form the inventive compositions.\u201d   (JTX-1 at 3:6- 11). \n195. The patent also describes an example in which \u201cFe release was measured according \nto European Pharmacopeia chapter 2.9.3 using standard dissolution equipment and parameters as described in the monograph.\u201d   (JTX-1 at 14:48- 50).  Six out of seven tablets t ested had a release \nrate of less than 2.5%.  ( JTX-1 at 15:10- 20). \n196. The \u2019251 patent contains explicit guidance about how to make the claimed \npharmaceutical compositions, including information about the type and brand of starch that can be \nused to make chewab le tablets that achieve the claimed iron release rate.  (JTX-1 at 14:1- 15:20) .  \nSpecifically, Table 7 of the \u2019251 patent identifies Lycatab\u00ae pregelatinized starch as being used in 39 chewable tablets with iron release rates below 2.5%.   (JTX-1 at 14:10-23; see also Tr.  at 381:11-\n16). \n197. Accordingly, a POSA following the disclosure of the \u2019251 patent would be able to \nreadily produce compositions that satisfy claim 30. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Infringement  \nA patent is infringed when a person \u201c without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells \nany patented invention, within the United States . . . during the term of the patent.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 271(a).  Courts employ a two- step analysis in making an infringement determination.  See \nMarkman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  First, a court must \nconstrue the asserted claims.  See id.   Next, the trier of fact must compare the properly-construed \nclaims to the accused infringing product.  See id.   Literal infringement occurs where \u201c every \nlimitation in a patent claim is found in an accused product, exactly.\u201d  Southwall Techs., Inc. v. \nCardinal I G Co. , 54 F.3d 1570, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  \nB. Validity  \nAn issued patent is presumed to be valid.  See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282.  Therefore, to invalidate a \npatent , a party must carry its burden of proof by \u201c clear and convincing evidence. \u201d  See Procter & \nGamble Co. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 566 F.3d 989, 993- 94 (Fed. Cir. 2009) .  Clear and \nconvincing evidence is evidence that \u201c proves in the mind of the trier of fact an abiding conviction \nthat the truth of [the] factual contentions [is] highly probable.\u201d  Intel Corp. v. ITC , 946 F.2d 821, \n830 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted; first modification in original).  A \ndefendant\u2019 s burden to prove invalidity is \u201c especially difficult when the prior art [on which it relies] 40 was before the PTO examiner during prosecution of the applicat ion.\u201d  Hewlett -Packard Co. v. \nBausch & Lomb Inc., 909 F.2d 1464, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1990). \n1. Obviousness  \nA patent may not issue \u201cif the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art \nare such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing \ndate of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a).  Obviousness is a question of  law based on underlying \nfactual findings concer ning:  (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the differences between \nthe claims and the prior art; (3) the level of ordinary skill in the art; and (4) objective considerations \nof nonobviousness.  See Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17- 18 (1966).  To prove that a \npatent is obvious, a party must demonstrate \u201cthat a skilled artisan would have had reason to \ncombine the teaching of  the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and that the \nskilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success from doing so.\u201d  In re \nCyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended- Release Capsule Patent Litig., 676 F.3d 1063, 1069 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Amgen, Inc. v. F. Hoffman- La Roche Ltd., 580 F.3d 1340, 1362 (Fed. \nCir. 2009) ( \u201cAn obviousness determination requires that a skilled artisan would have perceived a \nreasonable expectation of success in making the invention in light of the prior art.\u201d ).  Although an \nanalysis of any teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine known elements is useful to an \nobviousness analysis, the overall obviousness inquiry must be expansive and flexible.  See KSR \nInt\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398, 415, 419 (2007).  The use of hindsight is not permitted \nwhen determining whether a claim would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art.  See id.  at 421 (cautioning against \u201c the distortion caused by hindsight bias \u201d and obviousness \n\u201carguments reliant upon ex post  reasoning\u201d ).  To protect against the improper use of hindsight 41 when assessing obviousness, the Court is required to consider objective indicia of non-\nobviousness, such as commercial success, failure of others, unexpected results, and long- felt but \nunmet need.  See, e.g., Leo Pharm. Prods., Ltd. v. Rea, 726 F.3d 1346, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  \n2. Enablement  \n\u201cThe enablement requirement asks whether the specification teaches those in the art to \nmake and use the invention without undue experimentation.\u201d  Enzo Life Scis., Inc. v. R oche \nMolecular Sys., Inc., 928 F.3d 1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal quotations omitted).  \u201cTo be \nenabling, the specification of a patent must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation.\u201d  MagSil Corp. v. Hitachi \nGlob. Storage Techs., Inc., 687 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n\u201cWhether undue experimentation is needed is not a single, simple factual determination, \nbut rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations.\u201d  In re Wands , \n858 F.2d 731, 737 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  These factors may include:  \u201c(1) the quantity of \nexperimentation necessary, (2) the amount of direction or guidance presented, (3) the presence or absence of working examples, (4) the nature of the invention, (5) the state of the prior art, (6) the \nrelative skill of those in the art, (7) the predictability or unpredictability of the art, and (8) the breadth of the claims.\u201d  Id.  Although \u201ca specification need not disclose what is well known in the \nart,\u201d \u201c[t]ossing out the mere germ of an idea does not constitute enabling disclosure.\u201d   Genentech, \nInc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 108 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  A patent \u201ccannot simply rely on the knowledge of a  person of ordinary skill to serve as a substitute for the missing information in \nthe specification.\u201d  ALZA Corp. v. Andrx Pharm., LLC , 603 F.3d 935, 941 (Fed. Cir. 2010) . 42 III. DISCUSSION  \nA. Infringement  \nVifor asserts that Teva \u2019s ANDA product infringes claims 29, 30, 33, and 56 of the \u2019251 \npatent .  As previously noted, the parties have stipulated to infringement of claims 33 and 56.   \n(D.I.  277, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  23, 24, 25).  Thus, the Court addresses only claims 29 and 30. \n1. Claim 29 \nThe only dispute about infringement of claim 29 is whether Teva\u2019s proposed ANDA \nproduct satisfies the limitation  requiring \u201cwherein the iron oxy- hydroxide is essentially non-\nbioabsorbable.\u201d  (FF \u00b6 48).  The Court construed \u201cessentially non- bioabsorbable\u201d to mean \u201cupon \noral administration, the iron oxyhydroxide is not absorbed by the human body in a clinically \nsignificant amount.\u201d  (FF \u00b6 49).  \nTeva asserts that claim 29 requires in vivo testing  to determine whether its product meets \nthe disputed \u201cessentially non- bioabsorbable\u201d limitation  and argues that bioequivalence alone is not \nsufficient .  (E.g., D.I. 309 at 1, 3 -5).  It is not, however, bioequivalence alone that is at issue.  Teva \nhas represent ed to the FDA that , upon oral administration, the iron oxyhydroxide  formulated in its \nANDA product is not absorbed in clinically significant amounts.  For  instance, the proposed label \nstates that sucroferric oxyhydroxide in Teva\u2019s proposed ANDA  product \u201cis practically insoluble \nand therefore not absorbed and not metabolized.\u201d  (FF \u00b6 52 ).  The proposed label also includes \ndata from a clinical trial showing  that iron uptake was \u201cquite low and insignificant\u201d when measured \nusing radiolabeled sucrof erric oxyhydroxide (the only iron  source in the tested product) .  \n(FF \u00b6\u00b6 53- 54). 43 Teva argues that these statements in the proposed label  are not relevant because they were \ncopied  from the Velphoro  package insert.14  These arguments , however,  ignore that Teva seeks \napproval to sell a product having these attributes, which is the relevant inquiry for infringement \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e).  See Sunovion Pharm ., Inc. v. Teva Pharm . USA, Inc., 731 F.3d 1271, \n1278 (Fed. Cir. 2013) .  Moreover, a s Dr. Rastogi opined, the expectation that a generic drug \nbehaves in the same manner as the branded drug is something that physicians rely upon when prescribing generic drugs.  ( FF \u00b6 55).  That is particularly apparent here, where i f that expectation \nis not correct  (i.e. if the ANDA product does not have same toxicity profile  as Velphoro) , patient \nsafety may be jeopardized.  (FF \u00b6 56).  Thus, it strains credulity for  Teva to argue that it has sought \nFDA approval without knowing whether its proposed package insert accurately describes its \nANDA product  (and without knowing whether its ANDA product could prove toxic to patients) .\n15  \nMoreover, Teva\u2019s proposed package insert is just one of the statements that Teva made to  \nthe FDA relating to the non- bioabsorbability of the iron oxyhydroxide as formulated in its ANDA  \nproduct.  Teva\u2019s pharmaceutical and product development reports state that the iron is \u201cnot \navailable in  soluble form to be absorbed in the [gastrointestinal tract].\u201d  (FF \u00b6\u00b6 58, 59).  The same \nreports then describe dissolution tests comparing Teva\u2019s ANDA product to Velphoro.  These tests  \nshowed that \u201c[b]oth test and reference did not show release in most relevant  fed state pH of GI \ntract\u201d and that the results were consistent with other literature that \u201cindicate  negligible release of \n \n14  Teva\u2019s expert, Dr. Fadem, would not confirm that the statements in Teva\u2019s package insert \naccurately describe Teva\u2019s ANDA product.  (Tr. at 226:14- 20). \n \n15  Teva\u2019s criticisms that Dr. Rastogi did not do in vivo  testing  are not well taken.  It is wholly \nuncle ar that conducting human testing for purposes of patent infringement could pass \nethical muster.  ( See Tr. at 114:4- 20).  Moreover, the Court agrees that it was fair for \nDr. Rastogi to trust the integrity of Teva\u2019s submissions to the FDA  \u2013 as Teva presumabl y \nexpects the FDA and clinicians to do.  ( Id.). 44 iron in the [gastrointestinal tract] for absorption.\u201d  (FF \u00b6 58).  These  statements and the \ncomparative study were not copied  from Velphoro but appear to be Teva\u2019s  own work.  Indeed, \nTeva\u2019s corporate representatives confirmed the accuracy of these conclusions, and  Dr. Fadem had \nno explanation for these representations Teva made to the FDA in any of these  reports .  (FF \u00b6\u00b6 60-\n61).   \nAlthough Teva attempt s to shrug off the statements in its proposed package insert (and \nother development documents) , the Federal Circuit has held that \u201c[t]here is no basis to disregard \nthe information contained on the package inserts, which are representations made to the FDA to \nestablish that the proposed generics possess the same characteristics  . . . present in [the] approved \nproduct[] .\u201d  Endo Pharm. Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 731 Fed. App\u2019x. 962, 974 (Fed. Cir. \n2018).  The fact that the relevant portions of Teva\u2019s package were copied from Velphoro  does not \nchange this analysis.  In Allergan, Inc. v. Watson Labs., Inc. \u2013 Florida, 869 F. Supp. 2d 456, 513-\n14 (D. Del. 2012), the Court rejected an argument nearly identical to the one Teva presents.   As \nhere, the Allergan ANDA filers copied pharmacokinetic data from the reference listed drug\u2019s \npackage insert.  The Allergan ANDA filers argued that the Court should discount their package \ninserts and instead rely on a study performed by one of their experts.  Id. at 512- 13.  The Court \nrejected this argument and found infringement based on the data from the reference listed drug \nthat the generics copied in their package inserts .  Similarly, he re, holding Teva to the \nrepresentations made in its package insert and pharmaceutical development  documents  is \nappropriate.   \nThe evidence establishes that the iron oxyhydroxide as formulated in Teva\u2019s  ANDA \nproduct is not absorbed in clinically significant  amounts  and thus Teva\u2019s  ANDA product infringes \nclaim 29.  45 2. Claim 30 \nThe only dispute about infringement of claim 30 is whether Teva\u2019s proposed ANDA \nproduct satisfies  \u201chaving an iron release rate of below 2.5% w/w .\u201d  (FF \u00b6 63).  The Court construed \nthis limitation to mean \u201cthe iron release measured in water at a pH of 3 according  to European \nPharmacopeia chapter 2.9.3 using standard dissolution equipment and parameters as  described in \nthe monograph, where iron content is analyzed by titration after 2 hours, wherein the  quantity of \niron dissolved after 2 hours is less than 2.5%.\u201d  (FF \u00b6 64).  \nAt trial, one witness testified regarding infringement of claim 30  \u2013 Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, \nDr. Myers , who tested six table ts in accordance  with EP 2.9.3 using standard parameters and \ndissolution equipment (Apparatus II).  (FF \u00b6 66).  When he measured  the iron content at a pH of 3 \nafter 2 hours by titration, t he iron release rate was  measured at a pH that ranged from 3.22 to 3.28 \nacross the six tablets of Teva\u2019s ANDA product, with an average pH of 3.25.  ( FF \u00b6 79).  Dr. Myers\u2019s \ntests showed that the six tablets of Teva\u2019s ANDA  product had an average iron release rate of 1.94% \nw/w, and ranged from 1.51 to 2.35% w/w.  ( Id.).  Based on these test results, Dr. Myers concluded \nthat Teva\u2019s ANDA product has \u201can iron release rate of belo w 2.5% w/w.\u201d  ( FF \u00b6\u00b6 79).  \nTeva contest s Dr. Myers\u2019 s results on two grounds :  (1) that the final pH values that \nDr. Myers observed after two hours, 3.22 to 3.29 with an average of 3.25, are not \u201cpH 3\u201d  as \nrequired by the Court\u2019s construction and (2) that Dr. Myers never tested Teva\u2019s product at a starting \npH of 3 because he adjusted the pH to 2.31 prior to adding the  ANDA product  table ts to the test \nmedium.  The Court addresses the arguments in turn. \na. Final pH values  \nDr. Myers \u2019s tests of the ANDA product showed an average pH at the two hour time point \nof 3.25.  (FF \u00b6 79).  Teva argues that this does not meet the \u201cpH of 3\u201d required by the Court\u2019s 46 construction because the Court\u2019s construction requires a pH of 3.0.16  Federal Circuit case law, \nhowever, warns ag ainst interpreting \u201cendpoints of the  claimed range with greater precision than \nthe claim language warrants.\u201d  U.S. Philips Corp. v. Iwasaki Elec. Co. Ltd, 505 F.3d 1371, 1377 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007).  In U.S. Philips , the Federal Circuit  affirmed the district court\u2019s determination \nthat the claim term \u201cbetween 10\u20136 and 10\u20134 \u03bcmol/mm3\u201d means \u201cbetween 1 x 10\u20136 and 1 x 10\u20134 \n\u03bcmol/mm3\u201d and rejected  the accused infringer\u2019s construction of the term to mean \u201cbetween 1.0 x \n10\u20136 and 1.0 x 10\u20134 \u03bcmol /mm3,\u201d noting that the specification did not intend for the quantities to be \nmore precise.   U.S. Philips , 505 F.3d at 1378.   \nThat is the case here.  Dr. Myers explained that a POSA reading the Court\u2019s construction \nand the \u2019251 patent specification would understand that the target pH is specified to the whole \nnumber  \u2013 \u201cat a pH of  3\u201d \u2013 not a number with additional significant figures such as \u201c3.0.\u201d   (FF \u00b6\u00b6 69, \n70).17  He explained that there is a scientific reason to specify a pH of \u201c3\u201d rather  than 3.0, and  that \nis because pH 3 simulate s the fed state of the stomach ,18 which a POSA would know is almost \nnever at a pH of exactly 3.0.  (FF \u00b6 70) . \nMoreover, Dr. Myers tes tified that, based on the level of precision specified in the Court\u2019s \nconstruction and the \u2019251 patent specification, \u201cat a pH of 3\u201d comprise s a pH  range of between 2.5 \nto 3.4 using basic rounding.  (FF \u00b6 69).  He noted that i f greater precision were required, a POSA \n \n16  As Vifor points out, \u201cattorney argument is not evidence and cannot rebut other admitted \nevidence.\u201d  (D.I. 297 at 9 (citing Elbit Sys. of Am., LLC v. Thales Visionix, Inc., 881 F.3d \n1354, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2018)  and Wasica Fin. GmbH v. Cont\u2019l Auto. Sys., Inc., 853 F.3d \n1272, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2017)) ). \n \n17  As noted above (n.7), Dr. Myers is a POSA and thus the Court recognizes his testimony as to his interpretation as relevant to a POSA. \n \n18  The Court notes tha t this testimony is consistent with Teva documents, which refer to the \nfed state pH as the \u201c most relevant \u201d in connection with its testing of iron release.  \n(E.g. DTX- 172 at 22) . 47 would expect to see additional significant figures explicitly stated  \u2013 i.e., \u201c3.0,\u201d not \u201c3.\u201d   (FF \u00b6 69).  \nDr. Myers\u2019 s analysis regarding rounding is also consistent with Federal Circuit case law.  In San \nHuan New Materials High Tech, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, 161 F.3d 1347, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1998) , \nthe asserted claim recited a range of 30%  to 36% of chemical compound, TRE, and the accused \nproduct had up to 36.45% TRE.  The Federal Circuit affirmed a finding of infringement, \nconcluding that the number \u201c36\u201d was interpreted to encompass up t he nearest whole number, i.e. , \nup to 36.5 rather than 36.0.  Id.  The Federal Circuit concluded that \u201c[i]t was not shown to be error, \nlegal or  scientific, for the Commission to recognize these limits of accuracy, and to round the \nmeasured  weight percentage s to the nearest integer.\u201d  Id . \nTherefore, Dr. Myers\u2019s  opinion that his observed pH range of 3.22 to 3.28 was \u201cat a pH of \n3\u201d to the whole number is consistent with the Court\u2019s claim construction based on mathematical \nrounding principles, and it is supporte d by his unrebutted testimony regarding the  purpose of the \niron release test within the framework of the relevant art.   Both the specification and the Court\u2019s \nconstruction are at the same level of precision  and the Court has been given no reason to read a \ngreater level of precision into either Judge Stark\u2019s construction or the description of the iron release \ntesting in the specification.  Had the patentee or the Court wanted to specify a pH of 3.0, it could \nhave done so.  It did not.  \nTeva\u2019s argume nts citing two of Plaintiffs\u2019 confidential  FDA submissions , PTX -323 and \nDTX- 69, do not undermine Dr. Myers\u2019 s opinions.  These documents describe a particular iron \nrelease test protocol and require that the pH  at two hours be \u201cpH 3.0 \u00b1 0.1, \u201d a more precise range \nthan required by the \u2019251 patent and the Court\u2019s construction.   (FF \u00b6\u00b6 82-83).  Moreover, the  iron \nrelease test described in those documents is  \u201cnot the same test method\u201d  as that described in the \n\u2019251 patent.  (FF \u00b6\u00b6 80-86).  Because the iron release tests in the FDA submissions are not the 48 same as the iron release test described in  the patent, neither  of these documents informs a POSA \nhow to perform the iron release test detailed in the \u2019251 patent.  \nb. Initial pH Adjustment  \nTeva criticizes Dr. Myers for adjusting the pH of the media to 2.31 prior to adding the \ntablet samples.   Dr. Myers explained, however, that EP 2.9.3 is a dissolution test but , before \ndissolution bega n, disintegration of the tablets occur red and that affected the pH of the media.  \n(FF \u00b6 72).  To account for this, Dr. Myers adjusted the pH prior to the addition of tablets so that \nthe pH with tablets would be 3 during dissolution and when iron release was measured  as required .  \n(FF \u00b6\u00b6 73-74).  Neither the specification nor the Court\u2019s construction requires the pH of the media \nto be any specific value prior to tablets being placed in the media and iron release measurement. \n(FF \u00b6 75).  Thus, Dr. Myers\u2019 s adjustment of the pH of the media prior to tablet disintegration \ncomplied with the Court\u2019s claim construction and, in fact , ensured that the dissolution test would \nbe conducted \u201cat a pH of 3.\u201d \nDr. Myers\u2019s testing established that Teva\u2019s ANDA Product has an iron release rate below \n2.5%, which is in accordance with the Court\u2019s claim construction order and the \u2019251 patent \nspecification.   Therefore, Teva\u2019s ANDA Product infringes claim 30.  \nB. Validity   \n1. Obviousness  \na. The \u2019442 Patent Does Not Render The Asserted Claims O bvious  \nEach of the asserted claims requires a \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d with \u201cat least 500 \nmg\u201d of iron oxy- hydroxide \u201cper dosage form.\u201d  ( FF \u00b6 127).   Defendant failed t o prove by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the claimed \u201cdosage form\u201d of \u201cat least 500 mg\u201d would have been obvious \nto a POSA at the time of the invention in view of the \u2019442 patent.   49 The \u2019442 patent  generally  teaches  that a \u201cdaily dose of the absorbents  according to the \ninvention is, for example, 1 to 3 g, preferably about 1.5 g of iron.\u201d  ( JTX-3 at 3:19-21; FF \u00b6\u00b6 132-\n133).  The \u2019442 patent does not teach how the daily dose would be administered ( i.e., as a single \ndosage form or across multiple dosage forms)  or whether the daily dose would be different for the \nphosphate binders  provided in the examples of the \u2019442 p atent .  (FF \u00b6\u00b6 93-105, 137-140).  Even \nso, Defendant argues that a POSA  would have understood that the 1.5 g daily dose of iron would \nbe administered  as three individual doses comprising 500 mg of iron because this is \u201cclearly \nestablished\u201d by the teachings of the \u2019442 p atent and the POSA\u2019s \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d regarding \nthe administration of phosphate binders.  (D.I. 299 at 3- 4, 4 ( citing product labels of different  \nphosphate binders  that are administered three times per day )).  The Court disagrees .  A POSA \nwould not have understood that the \u2019442 patent\u2019s teachings of a \u201cdaily dose of . . . 1.5 g of iron\u201d \nwould be split into three 500 mg doses  because the \u2019442 p atent provides no teaching about the \nnumber of administrations per day for the daily dose .  (FF \u00b6\u00b6 129-140).  Further, D efendant\u2019s \nevidence of a POSA\u2019s \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d regarding the administration of phosphate binders  is \nneither clear nor convincing and is outweighed by Plaintiff\u2019s competing evidence that not all \nphosphate binders are administered three times per day.   (FF \u00b6\u00b6 141-142); see also  Arendi S.A.R.L. \nv. Apple Inc. , 832 F.3d 1355, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ( \u201c[O]ur cases repeatedly warn that references \nto \u2018common sense \u2019 \u2013 whether to supply a motivation to combine or a missing limitation  \u2013 cannot \nbe used as a wholesale substitute for reasoned analysis and evidentiary support, especially when \ndealing with a limitation missing from the prior art references specified.\u201d). \nEven if the Court were convinced that a POSA would have understood that the \n\u2019442 patent\u2019s \u201cdaily dose of . . . 1.5 g of iron\u201d would be administered as  three 500 mg doses, \nDefendant still must show  by clear and convincing evidence that each 500 mg dose would be 50 packaged in a single \u201cdosage form.\u201d  Defendant argues that packaging each 500 mg dose in a \nsingle dosage form  would have been obvious to a POSA based on the \u2019442 patent\u2019s general  \nteaching that dosages \u201c can\u201d be formulated for oral application as \u201ctablets . . . or contained in \nsachets, for example\u201d and the POSA\u2019s motivation, consistent with their \u201cgeneral knowledge,\u201d to \n\u201creduce patients\u2019 pill burden[ .]\u201d  (D.I.  299 at 4 -5).  The Court is not persuaded.  Co ntrary to \nDefendant\u2019s assertion, a POSA would not have understood the  \u2019442 p atent  to teach  that 500 mg of \niron would be packaged in a single dosage form.  ( FF \u00b6\u00b6 137, 143).   Instead, the \u2019442 patent \nprovides no information regarding how much iron can be loaded in each  dosage form.  (Id.).  And  \nDefendant\u2019s reliance on a POSA\u2019s \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d to \u201creduce pill burden\u201d is unconvincing \nand undermined by Plaintiff\u2019s evidence that other phosphate binders were administered across multiple dosage forms.  ( FF \u00b6 142; see also  FF \u00b6\u00b6 145-147); see also  Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. \nSt. Jude. Med., Inc., 381 F.3d 1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2004)  (\u201cRecognition of a need does not render \nobvious the achievement that meets that need .\u201d). \nAs is often th e case, this obviousness issue comes  down to weighing competing facts \u2013 \nparticularly competing expert testimony \u2013 regarding what a POSA would have found obvious at \nthe time of the invention.   Here, i n considering and weighing the evidence presented at tria l, the \nCourt generally found Plaintiff\u2019s experts to be more credible.  Moreover, Defendant\u2019s obviousness \narguments rely on taking broad teachings from the \u2019442 p atent , then extrapolating onto them \nadditional limitations based on what a POSA allegedly would have known or done.  As such, \nDefendant\u2019s arguments suffer from significant and improper hindsight bias.  See Ortho -McNeil  \nPharm., Inc. v. Mylan  Lab\u2019 y, Inc., 520 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008)  (\u201cMylan \u2019s expert, . . . \nsimply retraced the path of the inventor with hindsight, discounted the number and complexity of \nthe alternatives, and concluded that the invention of topiramate was obvious.  Of course, this 51 reasoning is always inappropriate for an obviousness test based on the language of  Title 35 that \nrequires the analysis to examine \u2018 the subject matter as a whole\u2019 to ascertain if it \u2018 would have been  \nobvious at the time the invention  was made .\u2019\u201d (emphasis in original ) (citation omitted)) .  Thus, \nthe Court finds that Defendant has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the claimed \ncompositions \u201cwherein the amount of iron oxy- hydroxide per dosage form is at least 500 mg\u201d were \nobvious based on the \u2019442 patent alone.   (FF \u00b6\u00b6 144-145).  Because the \u201cwherein the amount of \niron oxy- hydroxide per dosage form is at least 500 mg\u201d limitation is present in each of the asserted \nclaims, the Court need not consider Defendant\u2019s other arguments regarding the obviousness of the \nasserted claims in view of the \u2019442 patent alone.  \nb. The Asserted Claims are N ot Obvious in V iew of the \u2019442 Patent \nin Combination with Hergesell and the Other Prior Art \nAsserted.    \nDefendant also argues that the \u2019442 patent in combination with Hergesell and other prior \nart render the a sserted claims obvious.  (D.I. 299 at 12-19).   \nFirst, in addition to referring to the teachings of the \u2019442 patent discussed above, Defendant \nargues that  Hergesell \u201cconfirmed the general practice of administering phosphate binder 3 times \nper day \u2018with meals[.]\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 299 at 13; JTX -7 at 2 (\u201c[P]atients were subsequently given a constant \ndose of 3 x 2.5 g stabilized polynuclear iron hydroxide . . . provide d as a powder in preweighed \nsachets.  The material was suspended in water and ingested together with meals.\u201d) ).  The Court is \nnot convinced by Defendant\u2019s argument.  Foremost, Hergesell does not refer to iron oxy-hydroxide \nformulations comprising saccharos e.  (FF \u00b6\u00b6 108-116, 154-156).  This is important because iron \noxy-hydroxide formulations comprising saccharose are required by the asserted claims and are \nwhat is taught by the \u2019442 patent in Example 1, which Defendant relies on. ( FF \u00b6\u00b6 150-157).  Thus, \nbecause Hergesell\u2019s formulations are different than the formulation described in Example 1 of the 52 \u2019442 patent, a POSA would not look to the teachings of Hergesell regarding dosages in their \nobviousness analysis of Example 1 of the \u2019442 p atent.  ( FF \u00b6\u00b6 150- 158).   \nEven if the Court were convinced that , based on the teachings of the \u2019442 patent and \nHergesell, a POSA would have understood that the \u2019442 patent\u2019s \u201cdaily dose of . . . 1.5 g of iron\u201d \nshould be split into three 500 mg doses, Defendant still must prove that each 500 mg dose would \nbe packaged as a single \u201cdosage form.\u201d  In this regard, Defendant argues, in addition to the teachings of the \u2019442 patent alone discussed above, that the \u2019442 patent in combination with \nteachings of the \u2019079 p atent or Hergesell teach a single 500 mg dosage form.  (D.I. 299 at 12- 13). \nRegarding the \u2019079 patent, Defendant argues that the \u201c[t]he backdrop of those teachings of \nthe \u2019442 Patent was the earlier [U.S. Patent No. 4,970,079 patent (\u201cthe \u2019079 Patent\u201d)], which [a POSA would have understood to have] already disclose d and suggested a \u2018unitary solid dosage \nform such as a compressed tablet\u2019 containing \u2018500 mg or more\u2019 of iron oxy- hydroxide in \u2018each \noral dose.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 299 at 12- 13 (citing \u2019079 Patent at 3:36- 55 (\u201c[T]he oxy -iron compound can be \nformulated as a liquid or gel suspension, or in a unitary solid dosage form such as a compressed tablet or capsule. . . . Thus, each oral dose of the therapeutic oxy- iron containing composition in \naccordance with this invention can contain from about 50 mg to about 500 mg or more of oxy -iron \ncompound.\u201d) )).  Again, however, t he Court is not convinced in this regard.  The \u2019079 patent \nbroadly describes \u201coxy -iron compounds,\u201d including at least iron oxides, iron hydroxide and iron \noxyhydroxides.  (FF  \u00b6\u00b6 119-126; 160; \u2019079 Patent at 3:12- 63).  The \u2019079 patent then teaches a \ndosage of an oxy -iron \u201ccomposition in accordance with this invention can contain from about \n50 mg to about 500 mg or more of oxy -iron compound,\u201d where this teaching is not specific to \nwhich of the species of oxy- iron compounds may fall into different portions of that range.  (\u2019079 \nPatent at 3:52 -55).  Additionally, when considering the \u2019079 p atent\u2019s teachings, a POSA would 53 recognize t hat the \u2019079 Patent does not describe any finished dosage formulations or how to \nformulate the disclosed oxy iron compounds.  ( FF \u00b6 171).  Moreover, the \u2019079 patent teaches that \na relatively smaller 174 mg dosage of one iron oxide compounds (ferrihydrite) was effective.  \n(FF \u00b6\u00b6 123-125, 161-162).   Thus, the Court finds that D efendant has not shown by clear and \nconvincing evidence that a POSA would combine the teachings of the \u2019442 patent and \u2019079 p atent \nto formulate a 500 mg, single dosage form.  Indeed, the \u2019079 patent \u2019s broad teaching directed to \nthe genus of oxy- iron compounds cannot be assumed to apply to all species for this obviousness \nanalysis.  See In re Baird , 16 F.3d 380, 382 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (\u201cThe fact that a claimed compound \nmay be encompassed by a disclosed generic formula does not by itself render that compound obvious.\u201d); In re Jones , 958 F.2d 347 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (\u201cdeclin[ing] to extract from [the case law] \nthe rule that . . . regardless of how broad, a disclosure of a chemical genus renders obvious any \nspecies that happens to fall within it.\u201d).  \nRegarding Hergesell, Defendant argues that \u201cHergesell confirmed [providing the \nphosphate binder] with a high load of iron oxy- hydroxide in a single  dosage form (i.e., a sachet \npowder packet) containing approximately 800 mg of iron oxy- hydroxide.\u201d   (D.I. 299 at 13).  The \nCourt disagrees.  First, as explained above, Hergesell\u2019s teachings regarding the dosages are not \napplicable to Example 1 of the \u2019442 patent.  ( See FF \u00b6\u00b6 108-116, 150-158).  Even so, Hergesell \nonly teaches \u201c a constant dose of 3 x 2.5 g stabilized polynuclear iron hydroxide  . . . provided as a \npowder in preweighed sachets.\u201d   (Hergesell at 2; FF  \u00b6 163).  From this, a POSA would not \nunderstand how much powder is contained in each sachet ( i.e., 10 sachets including 250 mg with \neach 2.5 g dose, or one sachet containing 2.5 g) or how much iron oxyhydroxide would be included \nper 2.5 g.  ( FF \u00b6 163).  Because of this, the Court finds that Defendant has not shown by clear and 54 convincing evidence that a POSA would combine the teachings of the \u2019442 patent and Hergesell \nto formulate a 500 mg, single dosage form.  \nThus, having considered and rejected each of Defendant\u2019s arguments that the \u201c dosage \nform\u201d of \u201cat  least 500 mg\u201d limitation  is obvious (the \u2019442 patent alone and the \u2019442 patent in \naddition to other prior art), the Court finds that the Defendant has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the  claimed compositions \u201cwherein the amount of iron oxy -hydroxide \nper dosage form is at least 500 mg\u201d were obvious.  Because the \u201cwherein the amount of iron oxy-\nhydroxide per dosage form is at least 500 mg\u201d limitation is present in each of the a sserted c laims, \nthe Court need not consider the Defendant\u2019s other arguments regarding the obviousness of the asserted c laims . \nc. O\nbjective Indicia  \nPlaintiff has asserted that several objective indicia of non- obviousness, long- felt but unmet \nneed, unexpected results , and commercial success further support that the asserted claims are not \nobvious.  As discussed above (FF \u00b6\u00b6 164-184), the Court has found that Velphoro satisfied a long-\nfelt but unmet need and has enjoyed some measure of commercial success, both of which provide further support the finding of non -obviousness.  Having found that Defendant failed to estab lish a \nprima facie case of obviousness for the a sserted c laims , however, the Court, does not address that \nevidence again in detail here. \n2. Enablement  \nAs a preliminary matter, Defendant argues that c laims 29 and 30 \u201cbroadly claim functional \nproperties without any formulation- limiting details\u201d and, according to the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling \nin Amgen , this \u201cweighs heavily against enablement.\u201d  (D.I. 299 at 28- 29 (citing  Amgen Inc. v. \nSanofi , 987 F.3d 1080 (Fed. Cir. 2021) )).  The Court, however, disagrees that c laims 29 and 30 55 lack \u201cany formulation -limiting details.\u201d  Instead, claims 29 and 30, which depend on c laim 1, set \nforth a specific \u201cpharmaceutical composition comprising . . .  iron oxy- hydroxide in high loading \n. . . and . . . carbohydrates comprising saccharose and starch . . . wherein the amount of iron oxy-\nhydroxide per dosage form is at least 500 mg.\u201d  ( JTX-1 at 15:23- 31).  These formulation- limiting \ndetails must be considered in an  enablement analysis.  \na. Claim 29 \nRegarding c laim 29, Defendant  argues that a POSA would not be able to determine what \nlevel of iron absorption is \u201cclinically significant.\u201d   (D.I. 299 at 29- 30).  In construing the claims, \nhowever, Judge Stark concluded that \u201c[b]ased on the description in the specification, a POSA \nwould know the bounds of the claim term with reasonable certainty\u201d because even though \u201cthe \nclaim does not set forth a specific amount of iron oxy- hydroxide that may be absorbed, a POSA \nwould know that any absorption would be minimal and unintentional compared to the absorption of iron deficiency treatments.\u201d  (D.I. 114 at 6).  Consistent with this, Dr. Rastogi explained that \nclinical significance wo uld be readily understood by a healthcare provider, and he gave several \nexamples of drugs that both do and do not release clinically significant amounts of iron.  \n(FF \u00b6\u00b6 186- 187).  Here , to make and use the claimed invention, a POSA could follow the working \nexamples, which the \u2019251 patent state s are \u201cessentially non -bioabsorbable.\u201d ( FF \u00b6\u00b6 190- 191).  \nTeva also argues that claim 29 requires undue experimentation because a POSA would \nhave to test \u201ceach and every individual patient\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether a particular product, when administered to a particular patient, would satisfy the claimed function.\u201d  (D.I. 299 at 29-30 ).  The \nCourt, however, credits Dr. Rastogi\u2019s testimony that this is not how a POSA would understand \u201cclinical significance,\u201d which is determined by looking at patient population averages, not any individual outcomes.  ( FF \u00b6 189).  56 For these reasons, the Court finds that Defendant failed to prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that claim 29 is invalid for lack of enablement. \nb. Claim 30 \nWith respect to claim 30, Defendant argues that undue experimentation is required to \nachieve the claimed release rate based on \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that the brand of starch may impact \nthe release rate.\u201d  (D.I. 299 at 30).  In making this argument, however, Defendant ignores that the \u2019251 patent identifies a specific brand of starch that can be used to make formulations with an iron release rate below 2.5%.  ( FF \u00b6 196).  Moreover, Teva misconstrues the law of enablement.  Under \nTeva\u2019s logic, Plaintiffs need to enable every potential combination and brand of starch.  But \nenablement requires only a sufficient disclosure that would allow a POSA to practice the claim \ninvention.  See Invitrogen Corp. v. Clontech Labs., Inc., 429 F.3d 1052, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 2005) \n(\u201cThe enablement requirement is met if the description enables any mode of making and using the invention.\u201d (citation omitted) ).  Here, the \u2019251 p atent gives explicit guidance how to make the \nclaimed pharmaceutical composition , including information about the type and brand of starch that \ncan be used to achieve the claimed iron release rate.   (FF \u00b6\u00b6 194-196).   Nothing more is necessary. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that Defendant failed to prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that Claim 30 is invalid for lack of enablement. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAs discussed he rein, after consider ing the entire record and the applicable law , the Court \nconcludes that (1) Teva\u2019s ANDA product infringes claims 33 and 56 of the \u2019251 patent; (2) Vifor has prove d that Teva\u2019s ANDA product infringes claims 29 and 30 of the \u2019251 patent ; (3) Teva has \nfailed to prove that any of claims 29, 30, 33, and 56 of the \u2019251 patent are invalid for obviousness 57 and; (4) Teva has failed to prove that either of claims 29 and 30 is invalid for lack of enablement.  \nAn appropriate order will be entered.IN THE UN ITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nVIFOR FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE \nRENAL PHARMA LTD. and  VIFOR \nFRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE RENAL \nPHARMA FRANCE S.A.S.,  \nP\nlaintiffs  \nv. \nT\nEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.,  \nDefendant.  ) \n) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) \n) C\n.A.
