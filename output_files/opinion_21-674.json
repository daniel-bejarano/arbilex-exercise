Fornell (\u201cDr. Fornell;\u201d collectively,\n\u201cDefendants\u201d).' (D.I. 14) For the following reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-\nPART Defendants\u2019 motion and stay this action pursuant to the first-to-file rule.\n\nOl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff Verint Americas Inc. (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019 or \u201cVerint\u201d), the successor-in-interest to\n\nForeSee Results, Inc. (\u201cForeSee\u201d), initiated this action on May 7, 2021, asserting causes of\n\naction for breach of contract against all Defendants (Count J); alter ego liability (Count II) and\n\n' The briefing associated with the pending motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is found\nat D.I. 15, D.L. 21, and DI. 22.\nunjust enrichment (Count III) against Dr. Fornell, CFI Group USA, and ACSI LLC; and fraud\nagainst Dr. Fornell and CFI Software (Count IV). (D.I. 1) The complaint alleges that Dr.\nFornell researched and developed customer satisfaction measurement approaches, including the\nAmerican Customer Satisfaction Index (\u201cACSI\u201d), and subsequently founded CFI Group USA,\nCFI Software, and ForeSee in 2001 with the goal of adapting the ACSI methodology to digital\nenvironments. (D.I. 1 at J] 2, 26, 29-30)\n\nIn April 2002, ForeSee obtained a ten-year non-exclusive license to use two ACSI-related\ndesignations that were owned by the University of Michigan, where Dr. Fornell worked as a\nprofessor. (D.I. 1 at \u00a7{ 26, 33) But when Dr. Fornell founded ACSI LLC in 2008, the\nUniversity of Michigan assigned ForeSee\u2019s non-exclusive license to ACSI LLC with ForeSee\u2019s\nconsent. (/d. at JJ 31, 34) Beginning in 2010, ForeSee started to use an improved component-\nbased statistical algorithm known as a Generalized Structured Component Analysis algorithm\n(\u201cGSCA algorithm\u201d) in its practice of the ACSI methodology. (Jd. at {J 35-37)\n\nWhen ForeSee\u2019s license with the University of Michigan was set to expire in 2012,\nForeSee executed a ten-year Limited Trademark Sublicense Agreement (\u201cSublicense\nAgreement\u201d) with ACSI LLC for continued use of the ACSI designations. (D.I. 1 at ]38) The\nSublicense Agreement included a right to terminate the license on four months\u2019 notice. (/d.)\nPursuant to the terms of the Sublicense Agreement, ForeSee notified ACSI LLC of its intention\nto terminate in August 2013, and the Sublicense Agreement was automatically terminated on\nDecember 8, 2013. (Jd. at { 40)\n\nOn December 20, 2013, ForeSee was acquired by Answers Corporation (\u201cAnswers\u201d), a\nbusiness providing cloud-based products to increase brand engagement, pursuant to an\n\nAgreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) in which Answers paid more than\n$200 million to acquire ForeSee. (D.I. 1 at \u00a2 41; D.L. 14, Ex. A) ForeSee was the surviving\ncorporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Answers. (D.I. 1 at 42) On the same day, CFI\nSoftware and Answers executed a Joinder and Waiver Agreement which contained a General\nRelease preventing CFI Software and its \u201cagents, trustees, beneficiaries, directors, officers,\naffiliates, subsidiaries, estate, successors, assigns, members and partners\u201d from asserting claims\nagainst ForeSee that could interfere in its ongoing business operations after the merger. (D.I. 1\nat ] 45; D.I. 14, Ex. B at 94) At the time of the Merger Agreement and the Joinder and Waiver\nAgreement, Dr. Fornell was the majority owner and controller of CFI Software, he served as\nChairman of the Board of ForeSee, and he held a majority equity ownership and senior\nmanagement or board positions in ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA. (D.I. 1 at {{ 43, 48) The\ncomplaint describes ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA as \u201caffiliates, agents and alter egos of Dr.\nFornell and CFI Software.\u201d (Id. at J 5)\n\nOn October 24, 2018, ACSI LLC sued ForeSee for trademark infringement and unfair\ncompetition in the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that ForeSee improperly used the ACSI\ndesignations after the termination of the Sublicense Agreement in December 2013. (D.I. 1 at \u00a5\n54; D.I. 14, Ex. C at J] 55-60) Specifically, ACSI LLC accused ForeSee of continuing to use the\nACSI name and marks in its advertising and promotional materials, failing to inform its\ncustomers that it was no longer applying ACSI methodology, using the ACSI name in its own\nproducts, comparing its customer satisfaction scores and methodology to ACSI scores and\nmethodology, and falsely promoting its survey results as using ACSI methodology. (D.I. 14, Ex.\nC at { 56-60)\n\nVerint acquired ForeSee\u2019s stock from Answers in December 2018. (D.I. 1 at {J 11, 52)\n\nVerint and ForeSee then merged, leaving Verint as the surviving corporation and successor to\nForeSee. (Jd. at f] 11, 53) Following the merger, CFI Group USA brought an action against\nVerint in the Eastern District of Michigan in September 2019. (D.I. 14, Ex. G) Asa sublicensee\nof the ACSI designations, CFI Group USA challenged the same business practices identified by\nACSI LLC in the litigation against ForeSee.? (D.I. 1 at $55)\n\nWhen Verint initiated this action in May 2021, it alleged that Defendants breached the\nterms of the Joinder and Waiver Agreement by filing the Michigan Lawsuits after releasing\nForeSee and its successors from all claims related to ForeSee. (D.I. 1 at [9] 56-57, 63-64)\nAlthough CFI Software is the only Defendant who was a party to the Joinder and Waiver\nAgreement, the complaint alleges that Dr. Fornell, CFI Group USA, and ACSI LLC are liable for\nbreaches of the Joinder and Waiver Agreement as affiliates or alter egos of CFI Software. (Id. at\n{1 64, 69-71)\n\nA month after the complaint in this action was filed, ForeSee and Verint jointly moved\nfor summary judgment against ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA in the Michigan Lawsuits. (D.I.\n14, Ex. I) The arguments raised in the summary judgment briefing correspond with the causes of\naction alleged in the complaint in this case. Among other things, the motion for summary\njudgment alleges that ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA waived their claims in the Michigan\nLawsuits as affiliates of CFI Software, a party to the Joinder and Waiver Agreement that released\n\nall claims relating to ForeSee. (/d. at 1-2) A hearing on the motion for summary judgment is\n\n2 The lawsuit brought by ACSI LLC against ForeSee and the lawsuit brought by CFI Group USA\nagainst Verint in the Eastern District of Michigan are collectively referred to herein as the\n\u201cMichigan Lawsuits.\u201d Defendants attach pleadings and a motion for summary judgment filed in\nthe Michigan Lawsuits to their motion to dismiss in the instant litigation. (D.I. 14, Exs. C-I)\nVerint does not object to the court\u2019s consideration of these exhibits, confirming that \u201ca court may\nconsider \u2018matters of public record\u2019 and \u2018undisputedly authentic documents\u2019\u201d in deciding a\nmotion to dismiss. (D.I. 21 at 15 n.3) (quoting Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir.\n2010)).\nscheduled to go forward on November 15, 2021. (E.D. Mich. C.A. No. 2:18-13319-GAD-APP,\nD.I. 140)\n\nIn July 2021, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in this action for failure to state\naclaim or, alternatively, to stay the matter or transfer it to the Eastern District of Michigan. (D.I.\n14) On October 8, 2021, this case was referred to the undersigned judicial officer to hear and\nresolve all pretrial matters, up to and including the resolution of case-dispositive motions. (D.I.\n24) The court heard oral argument on the pending motion on November 4, 2021. Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss is now ripe for resolution by the court.\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,\n790-91 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n\nalleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The analysis is a context-specific task requiring the\ncourt \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663-64.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nDefendants contend that this case should be dismissed, stayed, or transferred in\naccordance with the first-to-file rule, which serves the interests of comity and judicial efficiency\nby providing that, \u201c[i]n all cases of federal concurrent jurisdiction, the court which first has\npossession of the subject must decide it.\u201d Crosley Corp. v. Hazeltine Corp., 122 F.2d 925, 929\n(3d Cir. 1941); EEOC v. Univ. of Pa., 850 F.2d 969, 971 (3d Cir. 1988). There is no dispute that\nthe Michigan Lawsuits were both filed before the instant action.\n\nVerint briefly argues that the first-to-file rule does not apply because the claims in this\nlitigation are not sufficiently analogous to those at issue in the Michigan Lawsuits. (D.I. 21 at\n10-11) A comparison of the pleaded allegations in the Michigan Lawsuits and in this court\nconfirms that the Michigan Lawsuits involve fewer Defendants and no contract-based causes of\naction. (D.I. 1; D.I. 14, Exs. C & G) But complete identity of parties,? claims, and issues is not\n3 Verint mentions that the actions pending in each venue lack identity because this case \u201cinvolves\ntwo additional defendants who are not parties\u201d to the Michigan Lawsuits. (D.I. 21 at 11) The\nfour Defendants in this action include ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA, which are plaintiffs in\nthe Michigan Lawsuits. Verint\u2019s position regarding a lack of identity among the parties in each\n\nvenue is belied by its own complaint in this action, which alleges that Dr. Fornell founded ACSI\nLLC and CFI Group USA, he was the majority owner and controller of CFI Software, and he\nrequired for application of the first-to-file rule if there is \u201csubstantial overlap among the parties\nand issues involved.\u201d Bank of Am. v. S.ILP. Assets, LLC, C.A. No. 07-159-GMS, 2007 WL\n2698192, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 11, 2007); see Phoenix Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Teva Pharm. Indus. Ltd.,\n381 F. Supp. 3d 416, 419-20 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (applying a \u201cmore flexible approach\u201d to the degree\nof similarity required for application of the first-filed rule and rejecting the notion that the first-\nfiled rule is \u201climited to mirror image cases where the parties and the issues perfectly align.\u201d).\nAlthough the causes of action raised in each venue present distinct legal theories, they are\nlinked by the same factual underpinnings. Specifically, ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA brought\ntrademark infringement and unfair competition claims in the Michigan Lawsuits based on\nallegations that ForeSee continued to use the ACSI marks after its sublicense was terminated on\nDecember 8, 2013. (D.I. 14, Ex. C at J 43-62) These facts also form the basis for Verint\u2019s\nbreach of contract claims because CFI Software executed a general release of all claims against\nForeSee after ForeSee\u2019s sublicense was terminated and ForeSee allegedly continued using the\nACSI mark. (D.I. 1 at {] 4-6) Despite the execution of the general release of all claims in the\nJoinder and Waiver Agreement, Defendants initiated the Michigan Lawsuits years later. (Id. at\n{{ 63-67) Verint\u2019s focus on the Joinder and Waiver Agreement in its motion for summary\njudgment in the Michigan Lawsuits confirms that resolution of the contract-based issues in\nVerint\u2019s favor would likely dispose of the infringement and unfair competition claims in the\nMichigan Lawsuits. (D.I. 14, Ex. I at 13-24) Consequently, the policy goals of the first-to-file\nrule would be well-served by allowing the case to proceed in the Eastern District of Michigan.\nSee E.E.0.C. v. Univ. of Pa., 850 F.2d 969, 977 (3d Cir. 1988), aff'd, 493 U.S. 182 (1990)\n(explaining that the purpose of the first-to-file rule is \u201cto avoid burdening the federal judiciary\n\ncaused ACSI LLC and CFI Group USA to file the Michigan Lawsuits. (D.I. 1 at 29, 31, 43,\n48-49, 56)\nand to prevent the judicial embarrassment of conflicting judgments.\u201d); see also Wilson Wolf Mfg.\nCorp. v. Brammer Bio, LLC, C.A. No. 19-2315-RGA, D.I. 22 (D. Del. Dec. 8, 2020) (staying\ncase pursuant to first-filed rule to achieve \u201csimplification and reduction of duplicative effort\u201d\nwhere first-filed court had substantial experience with the parties and subject matter).\n\nVerint also alleges that an exception to the first-to-file rule applies because the mandatory\nforum selection clause in the Joinder and Waiver Agreement gives Delaware courts exclusive\njurisdiction over claims arising from it. (D.I. 21 at 8-10) \u201cThe presence of a valid forum\nselection clause may serve as an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 that would justify a departure from\nthe first-filed rule.\u201d See Samuel T. Freeman & Co. v. Hiam, 2012 WL 2120474, at *7 (E.D. Pa.\nJune 11, 2012). The Joinder and Waiver Agreement provides that \u201c[e]ach of the parties hereto*\nirrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware. . . and the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of any suit, action,\nproceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated hereby.\u201d (D.I. 14, Ex. B at J 5(g))\n\nDefendants do not argue that the forum selection clause in the Joinder and Waiver\nAgreement is invalid. Instead, Defendants suggest that Verint waived reliance on the forum\nselection clause by actively litigating the Michigan Lawsuits for about two years before seeking\nto enforce the forum selection clause. (D.I. 22 at 2-4) Courts have held that a forum selection\nclause may be deemed waived \u201cwhere the party invoking it has taken actions inconsistent with it,\nor delayed its enforcement, and other parties would be prejudiced.\u201d Wachovia Bank Nat\u2019l Ass'n\nv. EnCap Golf. Holdings, LLC, 690 F. Supp. 2d 311, 328 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citations omitted).\nThe inquiry is fact-specific, and \u201cthere is no bright-line rule for determining whether waiver has\n\n4 The parties to the Joinder and Waiver Agreement are Answers and CFI Software. (D.I. 14, Ex.\nB at FORESEE_0374281-83)\nor has not occurred.\u201d Jd. (citing Krape v. PDK Labs Inc., 194 F.R.D. 82, 86 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)).\nThe record before the court shows that Verint took actions inconsistent with the forum selection\nclause, and Defendants would be prejudiced by enforcement of the forum selection clause at this\nlate stage of the Michigan Lawsuits.\n\nCourts have declined to enforce forum selection clauses where, as here, those clauses\nwere not asserted in a motion to dismiss or as an affirmative defense in a pleading. See Elias v.\nGettry Marcus CPA, P.C., 2019 WL 10947069, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2019) (finding that\ndefendants \u201cfailed to preserve their proclaimed contractual rights under the . . . mandatory forum\nselection clause by not stating that the complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).\nIn this case, Verint and ForeSee affirmatively moved for summary judgment in the Michigan\nLawsuits and asserted contract-based defenses in their motion practice after declining to raise\nany contractual defenses or issues pertaining to venue at the pleadings stage. (D.I. 14, Exs. D, E,\nH, I) Verint attempts to explain this delay by suggesting that it did not understand the\nrelationships among Defendants, the continuous nature of Defendants\u2019 business practices, and\nthe significance of the Joinder and Waiver Agreement until fact discovery in the Michigan\nLawsuits. (D.I. 25 at 25:24-26:16, 32:14-20) This explanation is implausible because the\nrelationships among Defendants are readily ascertainable from publicly available sources.\u00b0\nMoreover, ForeSee is a party to the Joinder and Waiver Agreement and cannot plausibly deny\nawareness of its terms. (D.I. 14, Ex. B; see also D.I. 25 at 30:17-22 (Verint\u2019s counsel\nrepresenting that \u201cForeSee negotiated for a Delaware forum. ... There is a reason why we want\n5 The Michigan Lawsuits were brought by CFI Group USA and ACSI LLC. (D.I. 14, Exs. C, G)\nAlthough neither of these entities was a signatory to the Joinder and Waiver Agreement, a\ncursory review of their websites confirms that they are associated with and founded by Dr.\n\nFornell, and that \u201cCFI\u201d stands for \u201cClaes Fornell International.\u201d See https://cfigroup.com;\nhttps://www.theacsi.org/ (last visited November 9, 2021).\nto be in Delaware.\u201d)). Verint\u2019s failure to assert the forum selection clause during the first several\nmonths of the Michigan Lawsuits, combined with its affirmative conduct in asserting contract-\nbased arguments in its summary judgment motion, support a finding that Verint waived its\ncontractual rights under the forum selection clause of the Joinder and Waiver Agreement. See\nAm. Int'l Grp. Europe S.A. v. Franco Vago Int'l, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d 369, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)\n(finding waiver where the defendant failed to assert the forum selection clause for nearly a year\nbefore raising it for the first time in its opposition to the plaintiff's motion for summary\nJudgment).\n\nHaving determined that the forum selection clause in the Joinder and Waiver Agreement\ndoes not provide a viable exception to the first-to-file rule, I recommend that the court apply the\nrule and stay this action until resolution of case dispositive motions in the Michigan Lawsuits. A\nprimary goal of the first-to-file rule is to avoid the risk of inconsistent rulings. See Cellectis S.A.\nv. Precision Biosciences, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 609, 613 (D. Del. 2012). The complaint\u2019s\nallegations regarding the applicability of the general release in the Joinder and Waiver\nAgreement in this action are also pending before the Eastern District of Michigan on Verint\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment. (D.I. 1; D.I. 14, Ex. I at 13-24) Specifically, Verint argues in\nboth venues that Defendants\u2019 claims in the Michigan Lawsuits were brought in violation of the\nJoinder and Waiver Agreement, and Defendants respond that Verint waived its right to invoke\nthe general release provision of the Joinder and Waiver Agreement by failing to plead it as an\naffirmative defense in the Michigan Lawsuits. (E.D. Mich. C.A. No. 2:18-13319-GAD-APP,\nD.I. 127 at 1-7; D.I. 1; D.I. 14, Ex. I at 13-24; D.I. 22) Thus, staying this action until resolution\nof case dispositive motions in the Michigan Lawsuits will avoid the risk of inconsistent rulings\n\nregarding the applicability of the general release provision of the Joinder and Waiver Agreement.\nSee Chavez v. Dole Food Co., Inc., 836 F.3d 205, 216-17 (3d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWhen a district court\ndecides to apply the first-filed rule, it then faces the discretionary choice whether to stay the\nsecond-filed action, transfer it, dismiss it without prejudice, or dismiss it with prejudice, thereby\npermanently terminating the case.\u201d).\n\nThe three factors generally considered on a motion to stay also weigh in favor of granting\nDefendants\u2019 alternative request for a stay. Courts consider: (1) whether a stay will simplify the\nissues for trial; (2) the status of the litigation; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant\nto suffer undue prejudice from the delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage.\nSee Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS, 2021 WL 616992,\nat *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021). A stay is likely to simplify the issues for trial because a ruling on\nsummary judgment in the Michigan Lawsuits may dispose of the contractual issues before the\ncourt in this action. Moreover, the status of the litigation weighs in favor of a stay because this\ncase remains at the pleadings stage, no scheduling order has been entered, and discovery has not\nyet begun. Finally, Verint will not suffer undue prejudice from the delay because the contractual\nissues in this case are currently pending before the Eastern District of Michigan on a fully briefed\nmotion for summary judgment, with oral argument scheduled on November 15, 2021.\n\nI recommend that the court deny Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this action. In Chavez,\nthe Third Circuit cautioned that, \u201cin the vast majority of cases, a court exercising its discretion\nunder the first-filed rule should stay or transfer a second-filed suit. Even a dismissal without\nprejudice may create unanticipated problems. A dismissal with prejudice will almost always be\nan abuse of discretion.\u201d Chavez, 836 F.3d at 220-21. Dismissal without prejudice could give\nrise to unintended consequences in this case. Verint\u2019s breach of contract claims identify the\n\nfiling of the Michigan Lawsuits in October 2018 and September 2019 as the alleged breach of\n\n11\nthe Joinder and Waiver Agreement. (D.I. 1 at 765) Paragraph 5(g) represents that Delaware law\ngoverns the Joinder and Waiver Agreement (D.I. 14, Ex. B at J 5(g)), and the statute of\nlimitations for a cause of action for breach of contract under Delaware law is three years, 10 Del.\nC. \u00a7 8106(a). Because dismissal of this second-filed suit could \u201chave the effect of putting the\nplaintiffs entirely out of court,\u201d dismissal is not appropriate here. Chavez, 836 F.3d at 217.\n\nIn addition, transferring the action to the Eastern District of Michigan at this stage of the\nMichigan Lawsuits would not serve the interests of judicial efficiency. Verint\u2019s arguments and\nDefendants\u2019 responses regarding the effect of the general release provision of the Joinder and\nWaiver Agreement are currently pending before the Eastern District of Michigan in the briefing\non the motion for summary judgment. (D.I. 14, Ex. I; E.D. Mich. C.A. No. 2:18-13319-GAD-\nAPP, D.I. 127) The motion for summary judgment has been pending in the Eastern District of\nMichigan since June 2021, and oral argument on the motion is scheduled for November 15,\n2021. (D.I. 14, Ex. I; E.D. Mich. C.A. No. 2:18-13319-GAD-APP, D.I. 140) Adding new\ncontract-based claims to the Michigan Lawsuits at this stage makes little sense when the issues\nraised by those claims may be resolved on summary judgment. Consequently, I recommend that\nthe court deny Defendants\u2019 alternative request to transfer this action to the Eastern District of\nMichigan.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART Defendants\u2019\nmotion. (D.I. 14) Specifically, I recommend that the court GRANT Defendants\u2019 motion to stay\nthis action and administratively close the case pending resolution of case dispositive motions in\n\nthe Michigan Lawsuits, and I recommend that the court DENY Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\n\n12\nand motion to transfer.\u00ae I further recommend that the court order the parties to submit a joint\nstatus report in this matter within ten (10) days of the resolution of case dispositive motions in\nthe Michigan Lawsuits.\n\nGiven that the court has relied upon material that technically remains under seal,\u2019 the\ncourt is releasing this Report and Recommendation under seal, pending review by the parties. In\nthe unlikely event that the parties believe that certain material in this Report and\nRecommendation should be redacted, the parties shall jointly submit a proposed redacted version\nby no later than November 16, 2021, for review by the court, along with a motion supported by\na declaration that includes a clear, factually detailed explanation as to why disclosure of any\nproposed redacted material would \u201cwork a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking\nclosure.\u201d See In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liab. Litig., 924 F.3d 662, 672 (3d\nCir. 2019) (quoting Miller v. Ind. Hosp., 16 F.3d 549, 551 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). If the parties do not file a proposed redacted version and corresponding\nmotion, or if the court determines the motion lacks a meritorious basis, the documents will be\nunsealed within thirty (30) days of the date the Report and Recommendation issued.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\n\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\n\n6 By way of this recommendation, I further recommend that the court terminate the motion to\ndismiss filed at D.I. 20, which appears to be a redacted version of the pending motion to dismiss\nat D.I. 14 that was filed using the wrong event code.\n\n7 Although the briefing on the pending motion was not filed under seal, the court has referred to\nthe parties\u2019 summary judgment briefing filed in the Eastern District of Michigan. The docket in\nthis matter indicates that the briefing on Verint\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the Michigan\nLawsuits is confidential and it was filed it under seal in this matter. (D.I. 14, Ex. I) The court\nconfines any proposed redactions to the sealed exhibits from the Michigan Lawsuits. The parties\nare not permitted to propose redactions of material publicly filed.\n\n13\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: November 10, 2021\n\nAGISTRATE JUDGE\n\n14\n"}
