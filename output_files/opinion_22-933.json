Andrews", "date": "10-25-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nWILLIAM J. WEBB, JR.,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-933-RGA\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, et al., :\nDefendants.\n\nWilliam J. Webb, Jr., James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. Pro Se\nPlaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nOctober 29 , 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nj\nANDREWS, if District Judge:\n\nPlaintiff William J. Webb, Jr., a pretrial detainee at James T. Vaughn Correctional\nCenter in Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I. 1).\nPlaintiff appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (D.I.\n5). He has filed a motion to expedite the proceedings and a motion for injunctive relief.\n(D.I. 7, 8). The Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(a).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\npurposes of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542\nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). This case concerns Plaintiffs parental rights, a lifetime\nProtection from Abuse order (\u201cPFA\u201d) based upon alleged false and unreliable evidence,\nand visitation rights. Plaintiff alleges the following violations: \u201creunification while\nincarcerated, Fourteenth Amendment, failure to train, False Claims Act, exceeded\njurisdiction.\u201d (D.1. 1 at 6). He seeks compensatory and punitive damages and\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. (/d. at 9-10).\n\nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or\nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Baill v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,\n452 (3d Cir. 2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions); 28\n\n1\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental\ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and\ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93\n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel. 957 F.3d 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only\nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or\n\u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u201d /d.\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when\nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.\n1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless\namendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293\nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conciusions.\nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive\n\n2\nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim\nasserted. See id. at 11.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane\nConsir. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when\nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a\n\u201ccontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\nand common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Complaint will be dismissed for a number of reasons.\n\nThe Complaint raises claims against Warden Robert May, Staff Lt. DeJesus,\nTreatment Administrator Stacey Hollis, and Counselor Thongvong, all of whom are\nemployed at JTVCC. In the Complaint, Plaintiff states that the grievance process was\nnot complete when he commenced this action. He states that his grievance \u201c[w]as\nreturned, as unprocessed so [he] went on the tablet and wrote Warden Robert May.\u201d\n\n(D.I. 1 at 9). He wrote the counselor and he \u201cgot an illegal response.\u201d (/d.).\n\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, a prisoner must pursue all\navailable avenues for relief through the prison\u2019s grievance system before bringing a\nfederal civil rights action. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731,\n741 n.6 (2001) (\u201c[AJn inmate must exhaust irrespective of the forms of relief sought and\noffered through administrative avenues.\u201d). Section 1997(e) provides, \u201cNo action shall\nbe brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of the Revised Statutes\nof the United States, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison,\nor other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are\nexhausted.\u201d\n\nThe exhaustion requirement is mandatory. Williams v. Beard, 482 F.3d 637, 639\n(3d Cir. 2007); Booth, 532 U.S. at 742 (holding that the exhaustion requirement of the\nPLRA applies to grievance procedures \u201cregardless of the relief offered through\nadministrative procedures\u201d). There is no futility exception to \u00a7 1997e\u2019s exhaustion\nrequirement. Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 75-76 (3d Cir. 2000). An inmate must fully\nsatisfy the administrative requirements of the inmate grievance process before\nproceeding into federal court. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2004). Courts have\nconcluded that inmates who fail to fully, or timely, complete the prison grievance\nprocess are barred from subsequently litigating claims in federal court. See, e.g., Booth\nv. Churner, 206 F.3d 289 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nIf the actions of prison officials directly caused the inmate\u2019s procedural default on\na grievance, the inmate will not be held to strict compliance with this exhaustion\nrequirement. See Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279 (3d Cir. 2000). In addition, an\n\n4\ninmate\u2019s failure to exhaust will be excused \u201cunder certain limited circumstances,\u201d Harris\nv. Armstrong, 149 F. App\u2019x 58, 59 (3d Cir. 2005), and an inmate can defeat a claim of\nfailure to exhaust only by showing \u201che was misled or that there was some extraordinary\nreason he was prevented from complying with the statutory mandate.\u201d Davis v.\nWarman, 49 F. App\u2019x 365, 368 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Ross v Blake, 578 U.S. 632,\n643-44 (2016). \u201c[A]ldministrative remedies are not \u2018available\u2019 under the PLRA where a\nprison official inhibits an inmate from resorting to them through serious threats of\nretaliation and bodily harm.\u201d Rinaldi v. United States, 904 F.3d 257, 267 (3d Cir. 2018).\n\nWhile exhaustion is an affirmative defense, the Court may sua sponte dismiss an\naction pursuant to \u00a7 1915A when the failure to exhaust defense is obvious from the face\nof the complaint. See Caiby v. Haidle, 785 F. App\u2019x 64, 65 (3d Cir. 2019). Plaintiff\nadmits that the grievance process was not complete when he filed his Complaint. He\nstates that he received an \u201cillegal response\u201d but does not describe why the response\nwas illegal and does not indicate that he appealed the response. Given Plaintiff's\nadmission that the grievance process was not complete when he filed this action,\ndismissal for failure to exhaust is warranted as to May, DeJesus, Hollis, and\nThongvong.\n\nEven had Plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies as to these Defendants,\nthe allegations that Defendants defied a court order that allowed Plaintiff visits with his\nchild does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. It is long-established that\nthere is no absolute constitutional right to visitation. See Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Corr. v.\nThompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989) (no substantive due process right to \u201cunfettered\n\n5\nvisitation\u201d); Neumeyer v. Beard, 301 F. Supp. 2d 349, 351 (M.D. Pa. 2004), affd, 421\nF.3d 210 (3d Cir. 2005) (convicted prisoners and their families and spouses have no\n\u201cconstitutional right to visitation\u201d other than with legai counsel); see also White v. Keller,\n438 F. Supp. 110, 115-18 (D. Md. 1977) (neither prisoners nor prospective visitors have\nconstitutional right to prison visitation), aff'd, 588 F.2d 913 (4th Cir. 1978). Moreover, the\nConstitution does not require that inmates be allowed visits when prison administrators\ndetermine, in their sound discretion, that such visits jeopardize the security of the\ninstitution or conflict with an orderly administration of the same for one reason or\nanother. See Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 589 (1984). Accordingly, the claims\nagainst May, DeJesus, Hollis, and Thongvong will be dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim.\n\nThe remaining Defendants are immune from suit. The Delaware Department of\nJustice and the Division of Youth and Family Services are immune from suit under the\nEleventh Amendment. See, e.g., Alston v. Administrative Offices of Delaware Courts,\n178 F. Supp. 3d 222, 229 (D. Del.), affd, 663 F. App\u2019x 105 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nJudge Joelle P. Hitch has judicial immunity. A \u201cjudicial officer in the performance\nof his duties has absolute immunity from suit and will not be liable for [her] judicial acts.\u201d\nCapogrosso v. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, 588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2009)\n(quoting Azubuko v. Royal, 443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir. 2006)). \u201cA judge will not be\ndeprived of immunity because the action [she] took was in error, was done maliciously,\nor was in excess of [her] authority; rather, [she] will be subject to liability only when [she]\nhas acted \u2018in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d /d. (citations omitted).\n\n6\nThe Complaint alleges in a conclusory manner that Judge Hitch \u201cexceeded her\njurisdiction\u201d yet the facts alleged do not support this conclusion. The Complaint alleges\nthat Judge Hitch presided over a termination of parental rights petition, she entered a\nPFA, she did not enforce a Court order, and she entered a lifetime PFA. All of these\nacts took place in Judge Hitch\u2019s capacity as a judge. Despite the unsupported\nassertions to the contrary, Plaintiff has not set forth any facts to show that Judge Hitch\nacted in the absence of jurisdiction. She will be dismissed as a defendant.'\n\nDeputy Attorney General Islanda L. Finamore has prosecutorial immunity for the\nclaims raised against her. The Complaint alleges that Finamore \u201cfailed her obligation to\nPlaintiff to uphold and enforce the laws in Plaintiff's favor.\u201d Prosecutors should not be\nencumbered by the threat of civil liability while performing judicial or quasi-judicial\nfunctions, see Odd v. Malone, 538 F.3d 202, 208 (3d Cir. 2008), and prosecutors acting\nwithin the scope of their duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution are\nimmune to suit under \u00a7 1983, Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 410 (1976). It is clear\nfrom the allegations that Plaintiff is unhappy with the actions taken by Finamore in her\ncapacity as a deputy attorney general. She has immunity and will be dismissed.\n\nFinally, Suzanne Valle has witness immunity. The Complaint alleges that Valle\n\nmade fraudulent statements to Judge Hitch. Witnesses are immune from \u00a7 1983 liability\n\n1 Some of the complaints against Judge Hitch are time-barred. Plaintiff complains of\njudicial acts that occurred on July 1, 2019, yet he did not commence this action until\nJuly 11, 2022. For purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are\ncharacterized as personal injury actions. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985).\nIn Delaware, \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two-year limitations period. See 10 Del. C.\n\u00a7 8119; Johnson v. Cullen, 925 F. Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).\n\n7\nwhere the claim is based on allegations of perjury, either at trial or during pretrial\nproceedings. See Rehberg v. Paulk, 566 U.S. 356, 367 (2012) (\"{A] trial witness has\nabsolute immunity [from suit under \u00a7 1983] with respect to any claim based on the\nwitness\u2019 testimony.\u201d); McArdle v. Tronetti, 961 F.2d 1083, 1085 (3d Cir. 1992) (witness\nimmunity applies to testimony given at pretrial hearings as well as to trial testimony);\nBenckini v. Upper Saucon Twp., 2008 WL 2050825, at *11 (E.D. Pa. May 13, 2008)\n(absolute immunity afforded to witnesses, including police officers, charged under \u00a7\n1983 for alleged perjurious testimony at pretrial proceedings). Valle has immunity from\nsuit and she will be dismissed.\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss as moot Plaintiffs motion for\nexpedited proceedings and motion for injunctive relief (D.1. 7, 8); and (2) dismiss the\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (iii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and\n(2). The Court finds amendment futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nWILLIAM J. WEBB, JR.,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No, 22-933-RGA\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, etal.\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 25\" day of October, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT 1S ORDERED that:\n\n1.
