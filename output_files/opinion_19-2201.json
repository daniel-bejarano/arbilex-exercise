Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \n \nBefore me is Defendant  Pharmacy Corporation of America\u2019s  motion for summary \njudgment  on the basis that this action is barred by res judicata .  (D.I. 51).  I have considered the \nparties \u2019 briefing.  (D.I. 52, 54, 56).  For the following reasons , I will GRANT  Defendant\u2019s \nmotion .  \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Burt Zweigenhaft sued Defendants PharMerica Corporation1 and Pharmacy \nCorporation of America  (\u201cPCA\u201d) for breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing related to PCA\u2019s purchase of the company  OncoMed.  (D.I. 11  at \u00b6\u00b6 110- 155).   \nZweigenhaft\u2019s claims arise from two contracts related to this purchase \u2014an Operating Agreement \nand a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (\u201cMIPA\u201d).  (D.I. 54 at 1- 2).   \nZweigenhaft \u2019s claims in this case are \u201cnearly identical\u201d to those in a prior action \ninvolving PCA .  (D.I. 54 at 13  (citing  Pharmacy Corporation of America, et al. v. Askari et al.  \n[hereinafter \u201cthe Askari Action\u201d] , No. 16- 1123 (D.Del. )).2  I conducted a bench trial in the \nAskari A ction on July 6- 8, 2020 and ruled in favor of PCA on the relevant counts .  (Askari \nAction, D.I. 229) .   \nZweigenhaft was not a party to the Askari Action, though he tried to join it.  ( Askari \nAction, D.I. 177) .  The Askari Action was litigated by Kaveh Askari, the majority shareholder in \nthe three holding companies (the \u201cOnco360 Members\u201d) that owned  OncoMed.  ( See Askari \nAction, D.I. 224 at 1- 2; D.I. 184, \u00b6 1) .  Zweigenhaft was the CEO, Secretary, and a Director of \nthe Onco360 Members.  (D.I. 53- 1, Ex. 4 at No. 6 ).  Askari and Zweigenhaft were the sole \n \n1 PharMerica Corporation was dismissed as a defendant on September 3, 2020.  (D.I. 29).   \n2 An appeal in the  Askari action is pending in the Court of Appeals.  No. 21- 2800 (3d Cir.) . Page 3 of 8 \n shareholders of the Onco 360 Members  at the time of the purchase, with Zweigenhaft having a \nminority share.  ( Askari Action, D.I. 224 at 1) .  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Summary Judgment  \n\u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  F ED. \nR. CIV. P. 56(a).  The moving party has the initial burden of proving the absence of a genuinely \ndisputed material fact relative to the claims in question.   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, \n323 (1986).  Material facts are those \u201cthat could affect the outcome\u201d of the proceeding, and \u201ca \ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d  Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Anderson v. Liber ty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  The burden on the \nmoving party may be discharged by showing an absence of evidence supporting the non- moving \nparty\u2019s case.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  T he burden then shifts to the non- movant to demonstrate \nthe existence of a genuine issue for trial.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585- 86 (1986).   \nWhen determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view \nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non -moving party and draw all reasonable \ninferences in that party\u2019s favor.  Scott v. Harris , 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007).  A dispute is \n\u201cgenuine\u201d only if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non -\nmoving party.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247- 49.   \n  Page 4 of 8 \n B. Res Judicata  \nRes judicata is a doctrine that \u201cexists to provide a definite end to litigation, prevent \nvexatious litigation, and promote judicial economy.\u201d   LaPoint v. AmerisourceBergen Corp., 970 \nA.2d 185, 192 (Del. 2009) .  The parties agree that Delaware preclusion law applies.   (D.I. 52 at \n11-12; D.I. 54 at 9).  Under Delaware law, r es judicata bars subsequent actions where : \n(1) the original court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (2) the \nparties to the original action were the same as those parties, or  in privity, in the case at \nbar; (3) the original cause of action or the issues decided was the same as the case at bar; (4) the issues in the prior action must have been decided adversely to the ap pellants in the \ncase at bar; and (5) the decree in the prior action was a final decree.   \nLaPoint , 970 A.2d at  192 (citation omitted).  Parties are in privity wh ere \u201cthe relationship \nbetween two or more persons is such that a judgment involving one of them may justly be \nconclusive on the others[.]\u201d   Levinhar v. MDG Med., Inc ., 2009 WL 4263211, at *8 (Del. Ch. \nNov. 24, 2009) (citations omitted).  Delaware courts consider \u201cwhether the interests of a party to \nthe first suit and the party in question in the second suit are aligned\u201d and whether there is a \n\u201cclose or significant relationship\u201d between the parties.  Id.  \n\u201cRes judicata is an issue of law,  and if the doctrine applies, there is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact and summary judgment is appropriate.\u201d  Mohammed v. May Dep\u2019t Stores, Co., 273 F. Supp. 2d 531, 534 (D. Del. 2003).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nZweigenhaft  contests only the second element of res judicata .  (See D.I. 54 at 13 -14).  \nThe issue is whether Zweigenhaft is in privity with the Askari litigants.   \nPCA argues that Zweigenhaft is in privity with Askari and the Onco360 M embers \nbecause (1) Zweigenhaft and A skari are the sole  shareholders in the Onco360 Members ; (2) \nZweigenhaft would have been entitled to a portion of the recovery in the Askari A ction; (3) \nZweigenhaft signed the contracts at issue in his role as an Onco360 director ; (4) Zweigenhaft Page 5 of 8 \n knew about the Askari A ction  and actively engaged with it ; and ( 5) Zweigenhaft appointed \nAskari as his \u201cagent and attorney -in-fact\u201d in the MIPA.  (D.I. 52).   \nI agree with PCA that Zweigenhaft is in privity with the Askari litigants.  At the very \nleast, Zweigenhaft  and the Onco360 Members have a sufficiently close relationship, and their \ninterests are substantially aligned.  As Zweigenhaft admitted , the present cause of action is \n\u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the A skari action.  ( Askari Action, D.I. 177 at 2) .  In his mo tion to \nconsolidate, Zweigenhaft noted, \u201cIf the Askari and Zweigenhaft Cases are not consolidated, the \nPlaintiff will be prejudiced with the potential application of collateral estoppel, res judicata and inconsistent verdicts [.]\u201d  Id.  Zweigenhaft, as co -owner of the Onco360 Members, expected a \nrecovery from the Askari A ction had  the Askari litigants  prevailed.   (D.I. 53 -1, Ex. 2 at 54:24-\n55:10).  With regard to the contracts at issue, Zweigenhaft\u2019s interests are aligned with the \nOnco360 Members.  \nThere is also a strong argument  for finding Zweigenhaft in privity with Askari, though \nthis finding is not necessary to my ultimate conclusion.  In the MIPA, Askari was appointed as an \u201cagent and attorney -in-fact of each of the Selling Shareholders \u201d including \u201cacting in the name \nof and on behalf of the Selling Shareholders\u201d for \u201cthe investigation, prosecution, defense and/or settlement of any claims . . . related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby [.]\u201d  (D.I. 53 -1, Ex. 3 at \u00a7 12.1(a)).  The MIPA is \u201creferenced in, and incorporated into, \nthe Operating Agreement.\u201d  (D.I. 11 at \u00b6 120).  Thus, for the claims at issue, Askari was designated to represent Zweigenhaft\u2019s interests.  Cf. Aveta Inc. v. C avallieri, 23 A.3d 157, 165, \n180 (Del. Ch. 2010)  (finding privity among shareholders when a  Purchase Agreement designated \na Shareholders\u2019 Representative).   Page 6 of 8 \n I find Zweigenhaft\u2019s arguments opposing privity unavailing.  The main thrust of \nZweigenhaft \u2019s argument that he cannot be barred from bringing the present suit because he was \ndenied the chance to join the Askari A ction.  (D.I. 5 4 at 1 0-13).  Zweigenhaft argues , \u201ccourts \nhave held that a plaintiff should not be barred from presenting all  of their arguments when they \nwere barred for other reasons, like jurisdictional reasons, in the previous action.\u201d  ( Id. at 12 \n(citing Maldonado v. Flynn, 417 A.2d 378, 383 (Del. Ch. May 29, 1980))).  The Maldonado \ncourt addressed claim splitting by the same plaintiff, not privity.  Id .  (\u201c[W]here it appears that a \nplaintiff could not for jurisdictional reasons have presented his claim in its entirety in a  prior \nadjudication, the rule against claim splitting will not be applied to bar this claim.\u201d ).  I do not see \nhow this is relevant to the question of privity.  As PCA argues , \u201conce Zweigenhaft is shown to be \nin privity with Askari and the Onco360 Members, the question is whether they, not Zweigenhaft, had an opportunity to present the claims in issue.\u201d  (D.I. 56 at 4).   \nZweigenhaft also challenges PCA\u2019s argument that shareholders in a closely held \ncorporation are in privity with the corporation and other s imilarly situated shareholders .  \nZweigenhaft points to the Restatement (Second) of Judgments  in support of this proposition.  \n(D.I. 54 at 11).  Section 59 of the Restatement  states:  \nIf the corporation is closely held, in that one or a few persons hold substantially the entire \nownership in it, the judgment in an action by or against the corporation or the holder of ownership in it is conclusive upon the other of them as to issues determined therein as follows:  (a) The judgment in an action by or against the corporation is conclusive upon \nthe holder of its ownership if he actively participated in the action on behalf of the corporation, unless his interests and those of the corporation are so different that he should have opportunity to relitigate the issue [.] \n\u00a7 59 (3).  PCA has presented evidence that Zweigenhaft did actively participate in the Askari \nAction by providing documents, meeting with A skari and/or Askari\u2019s counsel during the \nlitigation, receiving discovery from Askari\u2019s counsel , and testifying at trial.  ( D.I. 53- 1, Ex. 4 at Page 7 of 8 \n Nos. 15- 17; Ex. 7) .  There is no evidence that Zweigenhaft\u2019s interests are \u201cso different\u201d from the \nOnco360 Members that he should have the opportunity to relitigate.   \nUnder Delaware law, the relevant inquiries  are whether Zweigenhaft has a close \nrelationship with the Askari litigants and whether their interests are aligned.  Zweigenhaft\u2019s \nownership in the closely held Onco360 Members and participation in the Askari A ction are just \ntwo factors that point to a close relationship and aligned interests.  As the Restatement explains,  \n\u201cWhen [a] corporation is closely held, . . . interests of the corporation\u2019s management and stockholders and the corporation itself generally ful ly coincide.\u201d  \u00a7 59, cmt. e.  \nDelaware courts have found shareholders to be in privity in similar circumstances.  See \nLevinhar v. MDG Med., Inc., 2009 WL 4263211, at *8 (Del. Ch. Nov. 24, 2009)  (finding privity \namong shareholders and noting, \u201call four [parties] share identical interests as common \nstockholders\u201d) .  I find Zweigenhaft\u2019s attempts to distinguish Levinhar unavailing.  Primarily, \nZweigenhaft suggests that the Levinhar plaintiffs strategically refiled a case with different \nplaintiffs to achieve a different outcome.  (D.I. 54 at 11).  The present action is different, \nZweigenhaft argues , because Zweifenhaft \u201cwas not allowed to join the previous claims and was \nactually a named defendant in prior litigation.\u201d   Id.   \nI disagree.  As discussed  above, the fact that Zweigenhaft was not permitted  to join the \nprior action is not relevant to  the privity analysis.  Zweigenhaft\u2019s statement about being a \ndefendant in prior litigation appea rs to be a reference to litigation commenced in New York  but \ndismissed pursuant to a forum selection clause.  (See id. at 5, citing  Askari v. PharMerica et al., \nNew York Supreme Court, Nassau County, Index No. 608580/2016) .  Zweigenhaft does not \nexplain why he was named as a defendant in the New York action or how it should impact my analysis.  At any rate, the New York Supreme Court action is not the relevant action.  As to the Page 8 of 8 \n Askari Action, which is the relevant action , Zweigenhaft attempted to  join Askari and the \nOnco360 Members in it and has conceded  that the claims here are \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to theirs .  \n(Askari Action, D.I. 177 at 2) .  Thus, the evidence indicates  that Zweigenhaft\u2019s  interests are \nindeed aligned with the Askari litigants.  \nZweigenhaft \u2019s other arguments are not persuasive.  He  points to new evidence in the \nform of an expert report  and claims that he \u201cshould not be bound by the lack of similar evidence \nin the prior Askar i action[,]\u201d though he does not address this in his legal argument.  ( See D.I. 5 4 \nat 1, 7- 14).  An underlying principle of res judicata, however, is to promote finality.  \u201cIf simply \nsubmitting new evidence rendered a prior decision factually distinct, res judicata would cease to \nexist [.]\u201d  Torres v. Shalala, 48 F.3d 887, 894 (5th Cir. 1995) . \nFinally, Zweigenhaft suggests  that my denial of PCA\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of \nstanding is relevant to the issue of whether Zweigenhaft is in privity with the Askari litigants.   (D.I. 5 6 at 13  (\u201cThis Court already decided that the Plaintiff had proper authority to bring this \nclaim[.]\u201d )).  It is not.  In denying PCA\u2019s motion to dismiss, I determined that Zweigenhaft\u2019s \nclaim is not a derivative claim and that Zweigenhaft had standing to bring suit.  (D.I. 28 at 4- 6).  \nStanding and res judicata are two different concepts.  Res judicata was not at issue when I decided the motion to dismiss, and a finding of standing does not confer a even a weak shield against a finding of res judicata.  \nIV.
