Civil Action No. 19-176-CFC \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nBranden Wallace. Pro Se Petitioner. \nKathryn Joy Garrison, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, \nWilmington, Delaware. Counsel for Respondents. \nMarch 7, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware CL 1: !Lkf/ \nCONNOLLY, CHIEF dGE: \nPresently pending before the Court is a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and subsequent amendments filed by Petitioner Branden \nWallace. (D.I. 3; D.I. 8; D.I. 10) The State filed an Answer in opposition , to which \nPetitioner filed a Reply. (D.I. 15; D.I. 21) For the reasons discussed, the Court will \ndeny the Petition. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn April 1, 2010, members of the Governor's Task Force \n(\"GTF\"), which included Probation Officer Philip Graham \n(\"P.O. Graham\"), Probation Officer James Kelly (\"P.O. Kelly\"), \nand police officers, were conducting routine home visit \ncompliance checks in the Brookside , Newark area. Home visit \ncompliance checks are authorized by Delaware Department \nof Correction, Bureau of Community Corrections, Probation \nand Parole Procedure Number 7.3 (\"Procedure 7.3\"). At \napproximately 9:40 p.m., the GTF arrived at 79 Chaucer Drive \nto complete a home visit compliance check, because it was \nlisted as the address of two Level II probationers, [Petitioner] \nand co-defendant Johanna Garcia (\"Garcia\") . \n[Petitioner] had been recently charged with Offensive \nTouching against Garcia, resulting in a No Contact Order \nagainst [Petitioner]. Consequently, [Petitioner 's] continued \nresidence at 79 Chaucer Drive would be a violation of the No \nContact Order and, therefore , a violation of his probation . \nAccordingly, the compliance check was conducted to \ndetermine [Petitioner's] current residence. \nAt the time of [Petitioner's] Offensive Touching charge, his \nprobation officer, not P.O. Graham or P.O. Kelly, was advised \nof the No Contact Order and [Petitioner] provided him with a \nnew residence address. However, [Petitioner 's] new address \nwas not entered into the Delaware Criminal Justice \nInformation System (\"DELJIS\"). Therefore , it was not \navailable to P.O. Graham or P.O. Kelly on March 31, 2010, \nwhen a field sheet was printed for the purpose of conducting \nthe routine home visit compliance check. Upon arrival at 79 Chaucer Drive, P.O. Graham, accompanied \nby P.O. Kelly and Officer Eric Huston of the Delaware State \nPolice, knocked on the front door of the residence. P. 0. \nGraham also announced himself as a probation officer. \nDevonta Garcia (\"Devonta\"), co-defendant Garcia's fourteen\u00ad\nyear-old son, opened the door wide, which P.O. Graham \nunderstood as an invitation to enter the premises. \nAt or near the threshold, P.O. Graham asked Devonta \nwhether [Petitioner] or Garcia were home. Devonta answered \nin the negative. P .0. Graham entered and proceeded to \nconduct a \"safety sweep\" of the house to ensure that no one \nelse was on the premises. The only persons at the residence \nwere Devonta, his sister Shavonta Garcia, and Devonta's \nfriend Shane Minchew-all of whom were minors and playing \na video game at the time of the compliance check. \nDuring the \"safety sweep\" of the home, also considered to be \npart of the Procedure 7.3 home visit compliance check \"Walk\u00ad\nThrough,\" P.O. Graham entered Garcia and [Petitioner's] \nbedroom. There he noticed what appeared to be a bag of \ncocaine in plain view on a bedside table. P.O. Graham then \ncommenced Delaware Department of Correction, Bureau of \nCommunity Corrections, Probation and Parole Procedure \nNumber 7.19 (\"Procedure 7.19\") in order to execute an \nadministrative search of the residence. \nIn accordance with Procedure 7.19, P.O. Graham \nimmediately held a case conference with his supervisor, P.O. \nKelly. Together, they reviewed the entire Procedure 7.19 \nSearch Checklist. Thereafter, P.O. Graham received \npermission to conduct an administrative search of the \nresidence. He also received permission to search \n[Petitioner's] car parked in the driveway of 79 Chaucer Drive. \nThe administrative search of the residence yielded 1.9 grams \nof crack cocaine, 1.2 grams of powder cocaine, 26 bags of \nheroin, hypodermic needles and syringes along with other \npackaging materials, morphine and adderall pills, a handgun, \nammunition to a different handgun, and $2,251 in cash. The \nadministrative search of the car produced an additional 310.7 \ngrams of powder cocaine and a loaded handgun, matching \nthe type of ammunition found in [Petitioner] and Garcia's \nbedroom. \n2 Wallace v. State, 62 A.3d 1192, 1193-95 (Del. 2012). \nA. Plea Negotiations and Motion to Suppress \nPetitioner was charged with numerous drug possession and trafficking charges, \nfirearm possession charges, and one charge of second degree conspiracy. (D.I. 15 at \n8) Petitioner faced the possibility of being sentenced as a habitual offender to a \nmandatory term of life imprisonment if convicted at trial. (D. I. 16-15 at 81-82) After \nPetitioner's indictment and arrest, trial counsel moved to suppress the evidence \ndiscovered during the warrantless entry and searches of 79 Chaucer Drive and \nPetitioner's vehicle as unconstitutional, arguing that the probation officers did not have \nconsent to enter or search the residence without reasonable suspicion. (D.I. 16-15 at \n45-68; D.1.16-16 at 307) While the suppression motion was pending and prior to \nPetitioner's September 15, 201 O fast track hearing, 1 the State offered a plea to resolve \nPetitioner's violation of probation (\"VOP\") and new charges, which would have permitted \nPetitioner to plead guilty to trafficking in exchange for a recommendation by the State \nfor eight years of incarceration. (D.I. 16-16 at 306-07) On September 10, 2010, trial \ncounsel wrote Petitioner, explaining the options of taking the fast track plea or going to a \nhearing on his VOP charge. (D.I. 16-16 at 269) Trial counsel also told Petitioner that \nthe motion to suppress \"states strong legal grounds and I am optimistic we will win.\" Id. \nPetitioner had a \"firm position from the outset . . . that he was not going to accept the \nplea offer, and ... wanted to fight the charges against him.\" (D.I. 16-16 at 306-07) \nPetitioner subsequently rejected the plea offer. (/d.) \n1 Petitioner was placed on a fast-track calendar because he was on probation when he \nwas arrested. (D.I. 15 at 8 n.21) \n3 On September 16, 2010, trial counsel informed Petitioner that the same plea \noffer would remain open until his VOP hearing on September 22, 2010. (D.I16-16 at \n270, 306-07, 311) Trial counsel explained the options of taking the plea or going to a \nhearing on the VOP charge, and the consequences of rejecting the plea or losing the \nsuppression hearing. (D.I. 16-16 at 311-312) Trial counsel advised Petitioner that while \n\"we have strong grounds to support the suppression motion, I cannot guarantee the \nresult.\" (Id. at 312) Trial counsel also informed Petitioner that the State had advised \nthat the plea offer would increase to ten years plus the VOP sentence if he rejected the \noffer, and that the plea offers would get worse as the case proceeds. (Id.) Trial counsel \ninformed Petitioner that, if he did not accept the plea, the State was going to make a \nplea offer to his co-defendant Garcia, and the State would \"be looking for ... Garcia to \nassist the State in [Petitioner's] prosecution in return for a more lenient sentence for \nher.\" (Id.) Trial counsel informed Petitioner that he \"need[ed] to understand that there is \na tremendous risk in proceeding to trial,\" and if [he] change[d] his mind [about rejecting \nthe plea offer, he] need[ed] to contact [trial counsel] immediately.\" (Id.) Petitioner \nrejected the plea offer again, and the Superior Court found him in violation of his \nprobation and sentenced him to two years in prison. (D.I. 15-1) \nBefore the suppression hearing started on January 21, 2011, the State offered \nPetitioner a plea, and informed the Superior Court about its plea recommendation of \nseven years of incarceration: \nWe've had some further plea discussions, and as recently as \nthis morning the State had made a plea offer to [Petitioner] to \nresolve them. [Petitioner] faces B Section habitual sentencing \nif he is convicted. I have made it clear to this attorney and I \nbelieve his attorney has made it clear to [Petitioner], that, \n4 should the State be successful in this litigation I will seek a \nmandatory life sentence for [Petitioner]. And I want to make \nsure that if we are successful, [t]he [Superior] Court and I and \n[trial counsel] are not litigating this post-conviction where \n[Petitioner] claims he didn't know, or his attorney didn't advise \nhim. So, I would like [t]he Court to have a colloquy with \n[Petitioner] and have him state on the record that he is \nrejecting our seven-year offer, knowing he faces life, if \nconviction. \n(D.I. 16-15 at 81) Trial counsel then told the Superior Court that Petitioner understood \nthe plea offer and the risks involved, but still wanted to proceed: \nI spoke with [Petitioner] about the plea offer. He understands \nthe plea offer, what's at risk. He understands there is a \npotential that the State is going to seek a life sentence if he is \nconvicted at trial, that, if he loses the suppression hearing, \nthere is not going to be any other plea offers, and the State \nintends upon proceeding to trial. I spoke to him about it briefly \ntoday, and he states he understands it and wants to proceed. \n(Id.) The Superior Court held a brief colloquy with Petitioner, confirming that he wanted \nto reject the offer and proceed with the suppression hearing. (D.I. 16-15 at 81-82) \nOn March 4, 2011, after supplemental briefing, the Superior Court denied the \nmotion to suppress, and subsequently denied Petitioner's motion for reargument. (D.I. \n16-15 at 138-45, 157-61); see State v. Wallace, 2011 WL 2552640 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. \n4, 2011 ), rearg't denied by State v. Wallace, 2011 WL 2552550 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 8, \n2011). \nB. Stipulated Trial, Sentencing, and Direct Appeal \nFollowing the denial of the suppression motion, Petitioner agreed to a stipulated \nbench trial on the trafficking, possession with intent to deliver a narcotic schedule II \ncontrolled substance (\"PWITD\"), and possession of a firearm by a person prohibited \n(\"PFBPP\") charges (\"new offenses\") to avoid habitual sentencing and ensure a cap on \n5 the sentencing recommendation. Trial counsel explained the reasoning for agreeing to a \nstipulated trial as follows: \n[Petitioner] was facing a life sentence if he was convicted of \nthese charges after a jury trial. The State made the offer today \nof stipulated trial. If he did that, they were going to drop some \nof the charges, recommend a minimum mandatory for the \ncharges he pied guilty to, which would be 14 years. And that's \nwhat they would recommend. \n(D. I. 16-15 at 165) The following exchange occurred between Petitioner and the \nSuperior Court during the colloquy just prior to the bench trial: \nCOURT: So the advantage of going to a nonjury trial, a bench \ntrial with me, is the State will not ask that you be declared an \nhabitual offender if you're convicted, but only ask that you \nreceive the minimum sentences, as far as any of the charges \nagainst you that they are going to present this morning. \n* * * \nCOURT: And that's the only promise that's been made on the \nhabitual offender thing, is that correct, any promises? \nPETITIONER: A minimum of 14 years. \n* * * \nCOURT: The State would not ask for more than the 14 years? \nPETITIONER: Yes. \nCOURT: So, there are two things the State's indicated to you; \nis there anything else? \nPETITIONER: No. \n(D.1. 16-15 at 166-67) The Superior Court found Petitioner guilty of trafficking, PWITD, \nand PFBPP. See Wallace, 62 A.3d at 1193-95. \n6 At sentencing, it was disclosed that, when reaching the stipulation agreement, \nthe State had mistakenly represented to Petitioner that the minimum mandatory \nsentence for the new charges was 14 years when it was actually 16 years. See \nWallace, 2017 WL 4317261, at *1 n.3. During the sentencing hearing, Petitioner asked \nthe Superior Court to impose the 14 year sentence that was agreed to when reaching \nthe agreement on the stipulated trial. (D.I. 16-15 at 181) The Superior Court declined, \nexplaining that it was not bound by any sentencing recommendation the parties may \nhave reached, but rather, it was bound by statute to impose the minimum mandatory. \n(D.I. 16-15 at 181) The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to a total of 16 years in \nprison: 8 years of incarceration at Level V for the trafficking conviction, 5 years of \nincarceration at Level V for the PFBPP, and 5 years of incarceration at Level V, to be \nsuspended after 3 years for two years Level IV, to then be suspended after 6 months for \nLevel Ill probation, for the PWITD conviction. (Id. at 182) \nThereafter, Petitioner filed a direct appeal. \n(The Delaware Supreme Court] remanded [Petitioner's] \nappeal to the Superior Court with directions that it address: \n\"whether Devonta Garcia or [Petitioner] himself consented to \nentry of the premises;\" and whether \"the application of \nDepartment of Correction Probation and [Parole] Policy, \nProcedure 7.3 to this case is consistent with the U.S. \nConstitution.\" On remand, the Superior Court found that \nconsent to enter the home was given by Devonta Garcia at \nthe time of the compliance check, consent was given by \n[Petitioner] as part of his conditions of supervision, and that \nProcedure 7 .3 is constitutional. \nWallace, 62 A.3d at 1193-95. Upon return of the remand, the Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed Petitioner's convictions and sentences. Id. \n7 In June 2013, Petitioner filed a prose motion for post-conviction relief pursuant \nto Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"). See State v. Wallace, \n2017 WL 4317261, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 27, 2017). Petitioner filed an amended \nRule 61 motion and a motion for appointment of counsel in October 2013. See id.; (D.I. \n16-24; D.I. 16-25) Petitioner's first court-appointed attorney filed an opening brief in \nsupport of Petitioner's Rule 61 motion in February 2014, and then amended it in August \n2014. (D.I. 15 at 3) Petitioner's Rule 61 representation changed twice -his first court\u00ad\nappointed attorney ceased practicing law, and his second court-appointed attorney \nretired. (Id.) Petitioner's third and final Rule 61 counsel initially filed a motion to \nwithdraw, but later withdrew that request and filed an amended Rule 61 motion in April \n2017. (Id.) \nThe Superior Court denied Petitioner's amended Rule 61 motion on September \n27, 2017. See Wallace, 2017 WL 4317261, at *7. That same day, the Superior Court \nissued an Order Modifying Sentences, stating that it found \"extraordinary \ncircumstances\" under Superior Court Criminal Rule 35 to justify modifying Petitioner's \nrelated VOP sentence in order to make his sentence in this case conform with the \namount of time the parties had incorrectly calculated he would receive in their \nagreement to stipulate to a bench trial. (D.I. 16-16 at 353-56) The Superior Court \nmodified Petitioner's VOP sentence to discharge him as unimproved, and amended the \neffective date of his remaining sentence to allow him to receive credit for time-served \nsince his detention. (Id.) Petitioner appealed the denial of his Rule 61 motion, and the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision in April 2018. See \nWallace v. State, 184 A.3d 842 (Table), 2018 WL 1768652 (Del. Apr. 11, 2018). \n8 In April 2019, Petitioner filed a second pro se Rule 61 motion. See State v. \nWallace, 2019 WL 2486861, at *1 (Del. Super. Ct. June 13, 2019). The Superior Court \nsummarily dismissed the Rule 61 motion as second or subsequent under Rule 61(d), \nand the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that decision. See id. at *2; Wallace v. \nState, 222 A.3d 142 (Table), 2019 WL 5681412 (Del. Oct. 31, 2019). \nII. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES \nA. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\"AEDPA\") \"to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences \nr \n... and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\" Woodford v. \nGarceau, 538 U.S. 202,206 (2003). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal court may consider \na habeas petition filed by a state prisoner only \"on the ground that he is in custody in \nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2254(a). Additionally, AEDPA imposes procedural requirements and standards for \nanalyzing the merits of a habeas petition in order to \"prevent federal habeas 'retrials' \nand to ensure that state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under \nlaw.\" Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 693 (2002). \n8. Exhaustion and Procedural Default \nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief \nunless the petitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. \nConnor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). AEDPA states in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \n9 person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court \nshall not be granted unless it appears that-\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the \ncourts of the State; or \n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective \nprocess; or (ii) circumstances exist that render such process \nineffective to protect the rights of the applicant. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). This exhaustion requirement, based on principles of comity, \ngives \"state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking \none complete round of the State's established appellate review process.\" O'Sullivan, \n526 U.S. at 844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). \nA petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the \nhabeas claims were \"fairly presented\" to the state's highest court, either on direct \nappeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural manner permitting the court \nto consider the claims on their merits. See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 451 n.3 (2005); \nCastille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). If the petitioner raised the issue on direct \nappeal in the correct procedural manner, the claim is exhausted and the petitioner does \nnot need to raise the same issue again in a state post-conviction proceeding. See \nLambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997). \nIf a petitioner presents unexhausted habeas claims to a federal court, and further \nstate court review of those claims is barred due to state procedural rules, the federal \ncourt will excuse the failure to exhaust and treat the claims as exhausted. See \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732, 750-51 (1991) (such claims \"meet[] the \ntechnical requirements for exhaustion\" because state remedies are no longer available); \nsee also Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 92-93 (2006). Such claims, however, are \n10 procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749; Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, \n160 (3d Cir. 2000). Similarly, if a petitioner presents a habeas claim to the state's \nhighest court, but that court \"clearly and expressly\" refuses to review the merits of the \nclaim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is exhausted \nbut procedurally defaulted. See Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. \n255, 260-64 (1989). \nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims \nunless the petitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual \nprejudice resulting therefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if \nthe court does not review the claims. See McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F .3d 255, 260 \n(3d Cir. 1999); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750-51. To demonstrate cause for a procedural \ndefault, a petitioner must show that \"some objective factor external to the defense \nimpeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\" Murray v. Carrier, \n477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice, a petitioner must show that \nthe errors during his trial created more than a possibility of prejudice; he must show that \nthe errors worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial \nwith error of constitutional dimensions.\" Id. at 494. \nAlternatively, if a petitioner demonstrates that a \"constitutional violation has \nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\"2 then a federal court \ncan excuse the procedural default and review the claim in order to prevent a \nfundamental miscarriage of justice. See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446,451 \n(2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218, 224 (3d Cir. 2001 ). The miscarriage of justice \n2Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. \n11 exception applies only in extraordinary cases, and actual innocence means factual \ninnocence, not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 \n(1998); Murray, 477 U.S. at 496. A petitioner establishes actual innocence by asserting \n\"new reliable evidence-whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy \neyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence-that was not presented at trial,\" \nshowing that no reasonable juror would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a \nreasonable doubt. See Hubbard v. Pinchak, 378 F.3d 333, 339-40 (3d Cir. 2004). \nC. Standard of Review \nIf a state's highest court adjudicated a federal habeas claim on the merits, the \nfederal court must review the claim under the deferential standard contained in 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief may only be granted if \nthe state court's decision was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, \nclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates,\" or the state court's decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts \nbased on the evidence adduced in the trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2); see Williams \nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,412 (2000); Appel v. Hom, 250 F.3d 203,210 (3d Cir. 2001). A \nclaim has been \"adjudicated on the merits\" for the purposes of\u00a7 2254(d) if the state \ncourt decision finally resolved the claim on the basis of its substance, rather than on a \nprocedural or some other ground. See Thomas v. Hom, 570 F.3d 105, 115 (3d Cir. \n2009). The deferential standard of\u00a7 2254(d) applies even \"when a state court's order is \nunaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.\" \nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011). As explained by the Supreme Court, \"it \nmay be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the \n12 absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\" Id. at 99. \nFinally, when reviewing a habeas claim, a federal court must presume that the \nstate court's determinations of factual issues are correct. See \u00a7 2254(e)(1 ). This \npresumption of correctness applies to both explicit and implicit findings of fact, and is \nonly rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. See\u00a7 2254(e)(1); \nCampbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d 280,286 (3d Cir. 2000); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. \n322, 341 (2003) (stating that the clear and convincing standard in\u00a7 2254(e)(1) applies \nto factual issues, whereas the unreasonable application standard of\u00a7 2254(d)(2) \napplies to factual decisions). \nIll. DISCUSSION \nPetitioner asserts six Claims in his timely-filed Petition: (1) trial counsel provided \nineffective assistance by advising Petitioner not to take a favorable plea offer; (2) the \nDelaware courts denied Petitioner a full and fair opportunity to resolve his Fourth \nAmendment suppression issue; (3) appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nfailing to adequately argue the Fourth Amendment suppression issue on direct appeal; \n(4) appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that the State \ndefaulted on a term the parties had agreed upon in stipulating to the bench trial; (5) \nappellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that the Superior \nCourt erroneously assessed conflicting evidence regarding the probation officers' entry \ninto the home which led to Petitioner's convictions; and (6) post-conviction counsel \nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to present an argument in his first Rule 61 \nmotion that the State failed to comply with its Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) \nobligations with respect to an evidentiary scandal in Delaware's Office of the Chief \n13 Medical Examiner (\"OCME\"). \nA. Claim One: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel \nIn Claim One, Petitioner asserts that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance \nby telling Petitioner that the suppression motion stated strong legal grounds for \nsuppression and that he (trial counsel) was optimistic that Petitioner would \"win.\" (D.I. 6 \nat 19) According to Petitioner, trial counsel's deficient advice about the potential \nsuccess of the suppression motion \"robbed\" Petitioner \"of the opportunity to take two \nfavorable pleas.\" (Id.) The Superior Court denied Claim One as meritless, and the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed that judgment \"on the basis of and for the reasons \nassigned\" by the Superior Court. Given these circumstances, Petitioner will only be \nentitled to habeas relief if the Superior Court's decision3 was either contrary to, or an \nunreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. \nThe clearly established Supreme Court precedent governing ineffective \nassistance of counsel claims is the two-pronged standard enunciated by Strickland v. \nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) and its progeny. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 \n(2003). Under the first Strickland prong, a petitioner must demonstrate that \"counsel's \nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" with \nreasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel \nrendered assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Under the second Strickland prong, \n3See Wilson v. Sellers, 138 S. Ct. 1188, 1193-94 (2018) (reiterating that when a higher \ncourt affirms a lower court's judgment without an opinion or other explanation, federal \nhabeas law employs a \"look through\" presumption and assumes that the later \nunexplained order upholding a lower court's reasoned judgment rests upon the same \ngrounds as the lower court judgment). \n14 a petitioner must demonstrate that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for \ncounsel's error the result would have been different.\" Id. at 687-96. A reasonable \nprobability is a \"probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. at \n688. A court many deny an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by deciding only one \nof the Strickland prongs. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. \nIn order to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must \nmake concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them or risk summary \ndismissal. See Wells v. Petsock, 941 F.2d 253, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1991); Dooley v. \nPetsock, 816 F.2d 885, 891-92 (3d Cir. 1987). Although not insurmountable, the \nStrickland standard is highly demanding and leads to a \"strong presumption that the \nrepresentation was professionally reasonable.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. \n\"Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are \ngoverned by the two-part test setforth in Strickland.\" Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. 134, \n140 (2012). When alleged \"ineffective advice led not to an offer's acceptance but to its \nrejection, [h]aving to stand trial, not choosing to waive it, is the prejudice alleged.\" Lafler \nv. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156, 163-64 (2012). \"In these circumstances a defendant must \nshow that but for the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that \nthe plea offer would have been presented to the court (i.e., that the defendant would \nhave accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of \nintervening circumstances), that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the \nconviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe \nthan under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.\" Lafler, 566 U.S. at \n164. \n15 Turning to the first prong of the\u00a7 2254(d)(1) inquiry, the Court notes that the \nSuperior Court correctly identified the Strickland/Lafler standard as governing \nPetitioner's instant ineffective assistance of counsel contention. As a result, the \nDelaware Supreme Court's decision was not contrary to clearly established Supreme \nCourt precedent. \nThe Court must also determine if the Superior Court reasonably applied the \nStrickland/Lafler standard to the facts of Petitioner's case. See Harrington, 562 U.S. at \n105-06. When performing this inquiry, the Court must review the Superior Court's \ndenial of Petitioners ineffective assistance of counsel allegations through a \"doubly \ndeferential\" lens. Id. \"[T]he question is not whether counsel's actions were reasonable, \n[but rather], whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied \nStrickland's deferential standard.\" Id. When assessing prejudice under Strickland, the \nquestion is \"whether it is reasonably likely the result would have been different\" but for \ncounsel's performance, and the \"likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not \njust conceivable.\" Id. And finally, when viewing a state court's determination that a \nStrickland claim lacks merit through the lens of\u00a7 2254(d), federal habeas relief is \nprecluded \"so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state \ncourt's decision.\" Id. at 101. \nIn this case, the Superior Court found that \n[d]efense counsel have various duties and responsibilities in \nthe plea bargaining process. First, defense counsel must \ncommunicate formal plea offers to defendants. In addition, \ndefense counsel must explain the nature of the plea offer to \ndefendants. According to the Delaware Supreme Court, the \n\"decision to accept a plea offer ... must be an informed one, \nto be made only after full consultation with counsel.\" \n16 However, the ultimate decision of whether to accept a plea \nmust be made by the defendant. Therefore, it is the role of \ndefense counsel to explain the benefits and consequences of \na plea offer to the defendant so that the defendant is able to \nmake an informed decision to accept or reject. \nTrial Counsel's communications with [Petitioner] about the \nInitial Plea Offer and the Second Plea Offer satisfied this \nobjective standard of reasonableness. Trial Counsel wrote to \n[Petitioner] on two separate occasions to explain terms of the \nInitial Plea Offer. Trial Counsel explained to [Petitioner] that \nfuture plea offers would only get worse and that [Petitioner] \nwas facing the possibility of a mandatory life sentence if \nconvicted and sentenced as a habitual offender. In addition, \nTrial Counsel stated at the suppression hearing that he \nexplained to [Petitioner] the terms of the Second Plea Offer \nand the State's intention to seek a mandatory life sentence for \nDefendant if convicted. Therefore, Trial Counsel satisfied his \nobligation to inform [Petitioner] of plea offers and to counsel \nhim about the decision to accept or reject. \nIn addition, Trial Counsel's statements that he was \"optimistic\" \nabout the motion to suppress and that there were strong \ngrounds to support the motion to suppress were not \nobjectively unreasonable. Although Trial Counsel expressed \noptimism to [Petitioner] about the chance of success at the \nsuppression hearing, he qualified this optimism by writing, \"I \ncannot guarantee the result.\" In addition, Trial Counsel told \n[Petitioner] that there was a \"tremendous risk in proceeding to \ntrial.\" \nWallace, 2017 WL 4317261, at *4-5. The Superior Court also concluded that \"it was \nnot objectively unreasonable for trial counsel to believe that there were strong legal \ngrounds to support the motion to suppress.\" Id. at *5. The Superior Court explained \nthat, at the time of the suppression hearing, there was a genuine question about \nwhether Procedure 7.3 allowed for warrantless entry of a probationer's home and \nwhether Devonta Garcia gave consent for the probation officers to enter. Id. at *5. \nThe record supports the Superior Court's determination that trial counsel did not \n17 perform deficiently in evaluating the suppression issues because he informed Petitioner \nof the terms of the plea offers and gave Petitioner enough information to make an \ninformed decision about whether or not to accept the pleas. Although trial counsel told \nPetitioner that he believed they had \"strong grounds to support the suppression motion, \n[trial counsel stated he could not] guarantee the result.\" (D.I. 16-16 at 306-07, 311-12) \nTrial counsel explained to Petitioner that he faced a life sentence if he were convicted of \nall charges at trial, that plea offers would get less favorable as time went on, and that \nPetitioner \"need[ed] to understand that there is a tremendous risk in proceeding to trial.\" \n(D.I. 16-15 at 81-82; D.I. 16-16 at 311-12) Moreover, according to trial counsel's Rule \n61 affidavit, Petitioner did not want to take a plea and wanted to fight the charges on the \ngrounds asserted in the motion to suppress. (D.I. 16-15 at 81-82; D.I. 16-16 at 306) \nEven in this proceeding, Petitioner does not explicitly assert that he would have \naccepted the offered pleas. \nThe Superior Court also reasonably determined that Petitioner failed to prove \nprejudice. Prior to the start of the suppression hearing, the Superior Court conducted a \ncolloquy with Petitioner. During that colloquy, Petitioner indicated that trial counsel had \ndiscussed the State's second plea offer and had also informed Petitioner that he faced a \nmandatory life sentence. Yet, Petitioner still rejected the second plea offer and chose to \nproceed to trial. See Wallace, 2017 WL 4317261, at *6. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed to \nsubstantiate either prong of Strickland. Thus, the Court will deny Claim One for failing \nto satisfy\u00a7 2254(d). \n18 B. Claim Two: Fourth Amendment \nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that he was denied a full and fair opportunity to \nlitigate his motion to suppress the evidence discovered as a result of the searches of 79 \nChaucer Drive and his vehicle \"when the [Delaware] Supreme Court remanded the case \nback to the Superior Court\" which violated his due process right to have an impartial \ntribunal at his suppression hearing. (D .1.15 at 18) \nThe State properly argues that the instant Fourth Amendment Claim is not \ncognizable on federal habeas review under the doctrine established in Stone v. Powell, \n428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976). In Stone, the Supreme Court held that a federal court cannot \nreview a Fourth Amendment claim if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to \nlitigate the claim in the state court. See also Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 293 (1992). \nA petitioner is considered to have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate such claims if \nthe state has an available mechanism for suppressing evidence seized in or tainted by \nan illegal search or seizure, irrespective of whether the petitioner actually availed \nhimself of that mechanism. See U.S. ex rel. Hickey v. Jeffes, 571 F.2d 762, 766 (3d Cir. \n1978); Boyd v. Mintz, 631 F.2d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 1980). Conversely, a petitioner has \nnot had a full and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim, and therefore \navoids the Stone bar, if the state system contains a structural defect that prevented the \nstate court from fully and fairly hearing the petitioner's Fourth Amendment argument. \nSee Marshall v. Hendricks, 307 F.3d 36, 82 (3d Cir. 2002). Notably, \"an erroneous or \nsummary resolution by a state court of a Fourth Amendment claim does not overcome \nthe [Stone] bar.\" Id. \nIn this case, Petitioner filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence pursuant \n19 to Rule 41 of the Delaware Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Superior \nCourt denied the suppression motion after conducting a hearing. Petitioner then \nchallenged that decision in his direct appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. The \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's judgment. \nThis record clearly demonstrates that Petitioner was afforded a full and fair \nopportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claims in the Delaware state courts. \nAlthough Petitioner asserts he was denied a suppression hearing before an impartial \ntribunal, he really just disagrees with the Delaware state courts' suppression decisions \nin his case. (See D.I. 6 at 26-38) The fact that Petitioner disagrees with the state court \ndecisions and the reasoning utilized by the state courts is insufficient to overcome the \nStone bar. Therefore, the Fourth Amendment argument in Claim Two is barred by \nStone. \nC. Claims Three, Four, and Five: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate \nCounsel \nIn Claim Three, Petitioner contends that appellate counsel was ineffective for \nfailing to competently argue his Fourth Amendment claim on direct appeal. Claim Four \nasserts that appellate counsel failed to argue that the State reneged on one of the terms \nit promised when negotiating with Petitioner for a stipulated trial. And finally, in Claim \nFive, Petitioner contends that appellate counsel should have argued that the Superior \nCourt erred in relying on the probation officers' version of facts regarding their entry into \n79 Chaucer Drive rather than the version of facts provided by the three minors who \nwere at the house at the time of the officers' entry. \nThe record reveals that Petitioner raised Claim Four in his first prose Rule 61 \n20 motion, but post-conviction counsel failed to assert it in one of the subsequent amended \nRule 61 motions or on post-conviction appeal. Petitioner included Claims Three, Four \nand Five in his second Rule 61 motion. The Superior Court summarily dismissed \nPetitioner's second Rule 61 motion under Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61(d) \nas procedurally barred because it was second or successive and Petitioner failed to \nplead with particularity that new evidence existed to create a strong inference that he \nwas actually innocent, or that a new, retroactively applicable rule of federal or Delaware \nconstitutional law applied to his case and rendered his conviction invalid. See Wallace, \n2019 WL 2486861, at *2. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's \ndecision. See Wallace, 2019 WL 5681412, at *1. \nThe State contends that Claims Three, Four, and Five were procedurally \ndefaulted in the state courts and ultimately procedurally barred from habeas review, \nbecause the Delaware state courts found the Claims to be barred under Rule 61(d). \nThe State, however, does not address: (1) the history of Rule 61(d) and the fact that the \ncurrent version of Rule 61 (d) was added to Rule 61 in 2014; (2) the fact that the Court \nhas not yet decided whether the current version of rule 61(d) constitutes an independent \nand adequate state procedural rule for procedural default purposes when, as here, the \npetitioner filed his first Rule 61 motion prior to the 2014 amendment of Rule 61; and (3) \nwhy, given the aforementioned issues with Rule 61(d), the current version of Rule 61(d) \nconstitutes an independent and adequate state procedural rule. \nGiven the myriad of issues related to determining if the post-2014 version of Rule \n61(d) constitutes an independent and adequate state procedural rule for federal habeas \nprocedural default purposes, the Court concludes that the interests of justice are best \n21 served in this instance by addressing the merits of Claims Three, Four, and Six. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b){2) (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the \nmerits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in \nthe courts of the State.\"). The Court notes that claims of ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel are evaluated under the same Strickland standard applicable to \nineffective assistance of trial counsel claims. See Lewis v. Johnson, 359 F.3d 646,656 \n(3d Cir. 2004). An attorney's decision about which issues to raise on appeal is strategic, \nand an attorney is not required to raise every possible non-frivolous issue on appeal. \nSee Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 272 (2000); Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745 (1983). \nAs a general rule, the presumption of effective assistance of appellate counsel will be \novercome \"only when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented.\" Smith, \n528 U.S. at 285. \n1. Claim Three \nPetitioner contends that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by \nincompetently presenting his Fourth Amendment/suppression argument on direct \nappeal. The crux of the motion to suppress was that Devonta Garcia-the minor who \nopened the door for the probation officers- was 14 years old and lacked any actual or \napparent authority to consent to the probation officers entering the home or master \nbedroom. In response, the State argued that Petitioner had limited rights to privacy \nbecause he was a probationer and the entry into the home was not done to perform a \nsearch but, rather, was an authorized compliance check to determine if Petitioner was \nat the residence in violation of a no-contact order. (D.I. 16-16 at 287-88) On direct \nappeal, appellate counsel argued that the Superior Court erred in denying Petitioner's \n22 suppression motion because the probation officers did not have consent to enter the \nhome in the first instance and, in the second instance, they could not enter the home \nwithout reasonable suspicion. (0.1. 16-2) \nAs a result of appellate counsel's arguments, the Delaware Supreme Court \nremanded case to the Superior Court to determine if Devonta Garcia or Petitioner \nhimself consented to the probation officers' entry of the premises, and also to determine \nif the application of the Department of Probation and Policy Procedure 7 .3 was \nconsistent with United States Constitution. (0.1. 16-16 at 333) The fact that the \nappellate arguments caused the Delaware Supreme Court to remand the case \nessentially eradicates Petitioner's argument that appellate counsel did not competently \nargue the suppression issue. Notably, Petitioner has not indicated how appellate \ncounsel could have challenged the suppression issue in a more \"competent\" manner, \nnor has he demonstrated that appellate counsel ignored arguments about the \nsuppression issue that were clearly stronger than the arguments that resulted in a \nremand. Accordingly, the Court will deny Claim Three as meritless. \n2. Claim Four \nIn Claim Four, Petitioner contends that appellate counsel failed to argue that the \nState reneged on its promise not to ask for more than the mandatory minimum 14 years \nof imprisonment if Petitioner stipulated to a bench trial. The record reveals that the \nState mistakenly asserted that the minimum mandatory sentence was 14 years when it \nwas actually 16 years. Petitioner was sentenced to the minimum mandatory 16 years \nfor his new-offenses convictions which, when added to his two-year VOP sentence, \nresulted in a total 18 years of incarceration. \n23 Although appellate counsel did not raise on direct appeal the argument regarding \nthe State's mistaken sentencing assertion, the Superior Court actually modified \nPetitioner's sentence on the same day that it denied Petitioner's first Rule 61 motion. \nNotably, in its modification of sentence order, the Superior Court explained: \n[Petitioner] agreed to a stipulated bench trial for the New \nOffenses based, in part, on incorrect information that the \nminimum mandatory time he faced was 14 years. \n* * * \nAt the time [Petitioner] agreed to a stipulated bench trial, he \nhad already been sentenced to 2 years at Level V for the VOP \nand it was represented to him that the law required an \nadditional 14 years of minimum mandatory time for a total of \n16 years at Level V. Accordingly, the Court will modify the \nVOP sentence so that [Petitioner's] total sentence will be \nconsistent with the representations made to him when he \nagreed to a stipulated bench trial. Also, after modifying the \nVOP sentence, it is necessary to modify the effective date of \nthe sentence for the New Offenses so that [Petitioner] is \nproperly awarded credit for time served since his detention. \n(D.I. 16-16 at 354-356) The Superior Court then modified the VOP sentence to provide \nthat Petitioner was discharged as unimproved and modified the sentence for the new \noffenses to impose an effective date of July 23, 2010. (D.I. 16-16 at 356) \nTo recap, Petitioner was originally sentenced in 2010 to a total of 18 years of \nincarceration -2 years for his VOP and 16 years for the convictions at issue here -\nwith the sentences to run consecutively. (D.I. 16-15 at 186) His VOP sentence was \neffective as of July 23, 2010. See Wallace, 2017 WL 4317261, at *1. The Superior \nCourt's act of discharging Petitioner's VOP sentence as unimproved and changing the \neffective date of his sentence for the convictions at issue here to July 23, 2010 \nessentially changed Petitioner's actual term of incarceration to 16 years -the same total \n24 number of years Petitioner would have spent in prison had he been given the 14-year \nsentence the State mentioned during the stipulated-trial negotiations. Since Petitioner \nhas received the relief he argues he was denied by appellate counsel's failure to raise \nClaim Four on direct appeal, the Court will deny Claim Four as moot. See, e.g., Sibron \nv. State of New York, 392 U.S. 40, 57 (1968) (noting that a claim in a habeas petition \nchallenging a conviction becomes moot when it is shown that the petitioner has already \nreceived all the relief possible from that claim.). \n3. Claim Five \nIn Claim Five, Petitioner contends that appellate counsel was ineffective for \nfailing to advance an argument that the Superior Court erred in its resolution of \nconflicting evidence presented during the suppression hearing, bench trial, and remand \nby accepting the probation officers' version of what occurred during their entry into the \nhouse at 79 Chaucer Drive instead of the version of events provided by Devonta Garcia \nand the other two minors who were in the house. (D.I. 6 at 47-51) \nAs a general rule, credibility determinations are reserved for the trier of fact, not \nappellate courts. See Lavender v. Kum, 327 U.S. 645, 653 (1946) (noting that it \"would \nbe an undue invasion of the jury's historic function for an appellate court to weigh the \nconflicting evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and arrive at a conclusion \nopposite from the one reached by the jury.\"); United States v. Wise, 515 F.3d 207,214 \n(3d Cir. 2008) (\"It is not our role to weigh the credibility of the witnesses. Indeed, we \nmust be ever vigilant ... not to usurp the role of the jury by weighing credibility and \nassigning weight to the evidence, or by substituting our judgment for that of the jury.\") \nAs previously discussed, on direct appeal, appellate counsel did challenge the validity of \n25 the Superior Court's finding of consent with respect to the probation officers' entry into \n79 Chaucer Drive, and appellate counsel's challenge succeeded in getting the matter \nremanded to the Superior Court for further argument. The Delaware Supreme Court's \nact of remanding the case based on appellate counsel's arguments demonstrates the \nviability of the arguments raised, and Petitioner has not demonstrated that challenging \nthe Superior Court's determination of credibility issues would have been a clearly \nstronger argument than the two claims appellate counsel actually raised. Given these \ncircumstances, the Court will deny Claim Five. \nD. Claim Six: Ineffective Assistance of Postconviction Counsel \nIn his final Claim, Petitioner contends that postconviction counsel was ineffective \nfor failing to present a Brady v. Maryland violation claim with respect to an investigation \nin 2014 by the Delaware State Police and the Delaware Department of Justice into an \nevidence scandal that occurred at the OCME. The 2014 OCME investigation revealed, \ninter alia, that drugs sent to the OCME to be tested in criminal cases had been stolen. \n(D.I. 10 at 1-3) \nThere is no federal constitutional right to effective assistance of post-conviction \ncounsel. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 752 (1991 ). In fact, the AEDPA \nspecifically provides that \"the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal \nor State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a \nproceeding under section 2254.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(i). Therefore, the Court will deny \nPetitioner's instant ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel argument because \n26 it does not assert an issue cognizable on federal habeas review.4 See, e.g., Jordan v. \nSup't Somerset SCI, 2017 WL 5564555, at *1 (3d Cir. Feb. 15, 2017) (\"[C]laims alleging \nineffective assistance of PCRA counsel are non-cognizable in federal habeas, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(i).\"). \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide \nwhether to issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011 ); 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2253(c)(2). A certificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \n\"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" by demonstrating \"that \nreasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims \ndebatable or wrong.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n484 (2000). \nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. \nReasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly, the \nCourt will not issue a certificate of appealability. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed, the Court concludes that the instant Petition must be \ndenied. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n4Alternatively, Claim Six is procedurally barred from habeas review. Petitioner did not \npresent this argument to the Delaware state courts in his first or amended Rule 61 \nmotions that were pending at the time the OCME evidence scandal was discovered. At \nthis juncture, any attempt to present Claim Six in a new Rule 61 motion would be barred \nas time-barred under Rule 61 (i)(1 ). Since Rule 61 (i)(1) is an independent and adequate \nstate procedural bar, Claim Six is procedurally defaulted. Petitioner does not assert any \ncause for, and prejudice resulting from, his default of Claim Six, nor does he show that a \nmiscarriage of justice will result if the Claim is not reviewed on the merits. Thus, Claim \nSix is both non-cognizable and procedurally barred from federal habeas review. \n27 "}
