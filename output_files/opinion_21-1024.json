No. 21- 1024- RGA  \n   \n \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \nPlaintiff Timothy Thorn filed this action against New Castle County and three New Castle \nCounty police officers .  Defendants moved to dismiss  eleven of Plaintiff\u2019s  twelve claims .  (D.I. 9.)  \nFor the reasons  announced from the bench on July 14, 2022, I recommend that Defendants \u2019 motion \nbe GRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED- IN-PART .   \nI. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announced from the bench on July 14, 2022, as \nfollows:  \nThis is my Report and Recommendation on Defendants \u2019 \nmotion to dismiss.  (D.I. 9.)   I will summarize the reasons for the \nReport and Recommendation in a moment , but before I do, I want \nto be clear that my failure to  address a particular argument advanced \nby a party does not mean that I did not consider it.  We have carefully \nconsidered the complaint (D.I. 1) and  the parties \u2019 briefs (D.I. 10, 13, \n14) . . . .  We will not be issuing a separate opinion, but we will issue 2 \n a written document incorporating the [recommendation]  that I am \nabout to state . \n  \nFor the following reasons, Defendants \u2019 motion [should]  be \ngranted -in-part and denied -in-part. \n On the afternoon of July 15, 2019, Plaintiff was working in \nhis home office when he heard male voices coming from his downstairs living r oom.\n1  Plaintiff went out into his hallway and saw \nred dots projected onto the wall, which he believed were coming from the laser scope of a firearm.   He yelled that he was coming out \nwith his hands up, and he slowly walked down the hallway of his home an d towards the stairs.  When he reached the corner of his \nhallway leading to the stairs, he extended his hands around the corner first and then came around the corner with his hands up.   \n At the bottom of Plaintiff \u2019s stairway was a uniformed New \nCastle Cou nty police officer, referred to in the Complaint as John \nDoe #1.  Doe #1 had a firearm drawn and pointed at Plaintiff.  Doe #1 then holstered his firearm.  Plaintiff came down his stairs and noticed another uniformed New Castle County police officer, John Doe #2, in the living room.   \n Plaintiff asked the officers why they were there.  Neither \nanswered the question.  Doe #2 told Plaintiff that the officers needed to search Plaintiff \u2019s basement.  Plaintiff asked if they had a warrant.  \nThe officers didn\u2019 t answer that question either, and they left \nPlaintiff \u2019s house.  As the officers walked down the driveway, \nPlaintiff yelled, \u201c What the [expletive] are you doing in my house? \u201d \nand \u201cWhy the [expletive] are you pointing guns at me? \u201d  The \nofficers responded, \u201c Thank you, thank you.\u201d    \n Plaintiff saw another New Castle County officer, John Doe \n#3, standing in the street with a German Shepherd.  Plaintiff yelled at Doe #3 as well.  Doe #3 told Plaintiff \u201c to come out into the \n[expletive] street, \u201d which Plaintiff interpreted as taunting.  Plaintiff \nremained on his own property.  The officers then walked away.  \n The officers did not have an arrest warrant for Plaintiff or a \nsearch warrant for his house.  Plaintiff later learned that the police had been chasing a suspect in the neighborhood and that the suspect was apprehended a few blocks from Plaintiff \u2019s house.   \n \n1 The facts are taken from the allegations in Plaintiff \u2019s Complaint.  (D.I. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 12\u201329, 35\u2013\n41, 71\u201374.)  I assume the all egations to be true for purposes of resolving this motion to dismiss f or \nfailure to state a claim.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 3 \n  \nPlaintiff filed this action on July 14, 2021.  The Complaint \ncontains twelve counts and names as defendants Does #1\u20133, in their individual capacities, and New Castle County.  Counts I , III, and IV \nallege that Officers Doe #1 and Doe #2 are liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violating Plaintiff \u2019s constitutional right to be free from \nunreasonable searches and seizures.  Count V is a Monell\n2 claim \nagainst New Castle County.   \n The remaind er of the counts are federal and state claims \nagainst Does #1\u20133.  On October 22, 2021, Defendants moved to \ndismiss every count except Count III\n3 for failure to state a claim.4  \n(D.I. 9.)  In response to the motion, Plaintiff indicated that he was \n\u201cabandoning\u201d  Counts II and VI \u2013XII.  (D.I. 13 at 1; D.I. 15.)  Plaintiff \nis still pursuing Counts I, III, IV, and V.  Since everyone agrees that Count III should move forward, at issue in this motion are Counts I, IV, and V.  \n Count I alleges that Officers Doe #1 a nd Doe #2 used \nexcessive force against Plaintiff.  Count IV alleges that the same officers violated Plaintiff \u2019s right to be free from  unreasonable \nseizures.  I consider these two counts together because they are different ways of articulating a claim for violation of the same \n \n2 See Monell v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs ., 436 U.S. 658 (1978) (holding that a \nmunicipality may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 where a constitutional injury is caused by \na municipal policy or custom).   \n \n3 Count III alleges that Officers Doe #1 and Doe #2 violated Plaintiff \u2019s Fourth Amendment \nright to be free from unreasonable searches.   \n \n4 A defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201c To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018 state a claim to relief tha t is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. at  678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  \nA claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201c factual content that allows the court \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. \u201d  Id. (citing \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.  \u201cWhere a complaint pleads \nfacts that are \u2018merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \u2018 stops short of the line between \npossibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. \u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557).   \n  \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201c well-pleaded facts \u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions.  Id . at 679.  \u201c [W]hen the allegations in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d   Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (quotation omitted). 4 \n constitutional right: citizens have a Fourth Amendment right to be \nfree from  unreasonable seizures, and a seizur e effected through \nexcessive force is unreasonable and thus violates the Fourth Amendment. \n I reject Defendants \u2019 contention that the Complaint fails to \nplausibly allege that Plaintiff was \u201c seized. \u201d  (D.I. 10 at 15.)  In \nCalifornia v. Hodari D ., the Supreme  Court held that a seizure \nrequires either physical force or, where that is absent, submission to a show of authority.\n5  A show of authority is a set of circumstances \nwhere police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that they were not f ree to leave.\n6  The Complaint here \nplausibly alleges that Plaintiff submitted to a show of authority when he put his hands up in response to Doe #1 drawing his firearm.   \n  \nDefendants also contend that the Complaint fails to allege \nexcessive force and/or an unreasonable seizure because \u201c no force \nwas used against Plaintiff. \u201d  (D.I. 10 at 13.)  I also reject that \nargument.  A seizure can be unreasonable even if the officer does n\u2019t \nlay hands on the person being seized.\n7 \n \nDefendants point to evidence outside of the Complaint in \nsupport of their arguments that they acted reasonably under the circumstances and that they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n8  But \nthis is a motion to  dismiss, so the Court cannot consider evidence \noutside of the Complaint and must view the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.  Viewed in that light, the Complaint plausibly alleges that Plaintiff was seized by Doe #1 and that the  \nseizure was unreasonable.  Plaintiff was in his home when officers \nentered without a search or arrest warrant.  Doe #1 drew his firearm, \ncausing Plaintiff to put his hands up.  That is enough to plausibly \nallege an unreasonable seizure.   \n \n \n5 499 U.S. 621, 627 (1991); United States v. Waterman, 569 F.3d 144, 146 (3d Cir. 2009). \n \n6 United States v. Mendenhall , 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980); Hodari D ., 499 U.S. at 627.   \n \n7 E.g., Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 262\u201363 (2007) ( \u201c[An individual] sitting in a \nchair may submit to authority by not getting up to run away.\u201d ); United States v. Lowe , 791 F.3d \n424, 434 (3d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[W] e hold that when a stationary suspect reacts to a show of authority \nby not fleeing, making no threatening movement or gesture, and remaining stationary, he has \nsubmitted under the Fourth Amendment and a seizure has been effectuated .\u201d). \n \n8 Qualified immunity shields the officers from liability unless they violated Plaintiff \u2019s \nclearly established constitutional rights.   Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 182 (3d Cir. 2011).  5 \n It is possible that dis covery will reveal that Plaintiff was not \nseized, that Doe #1 acted reasonably under the circumstances, that \nthe brevity of any seizure weighs in favor of a finding that it was reasonable, or \u2014relevant to qualified immunity \u2014that the actual \nfacts of the officers \u2019 actions did not amount to a violation of clearly \nestablished law.\n9  All I can say at this stage is that the allegations in \nthe Complaint plausibly state a Fourth Amendment violation by Doe #1, and it is plausible that Doe #1 is not entitled to qualified immunity.   \n  However, I agree with Doe #2 that the Complaint fails to \nplausibly allege that he was personally involved in seizing Plaintiff.\n10 \n  Accordingly, Counts I and IV should be dismissed as to Doe \n#2 but not Doe #1. \n  I\u2019ll now turn to Count V, the Monell  claim against New \nCastle County.  While the Complaint plausibly alleges an illegal search and seizure by New Castle County officers, the County\u2019 s \nliability under  \u00a7 1983 \u201c may not be proven under the respondeat \nsuperior  doctrine but must be f ounded upon evidence that the \n[County] itself supported a violation of constitutional rights.\u201d\n11  \n \nTo succeed on a Monell  claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate \n(among other things) the existence of a municipal policy or custom \nand that the municipality, through its deliberate and culpable \nconduct, was the \u201c moving force \u201d behind the injury alleged.12  A \ngovernment \u2019s failure to act, such as a failure to train or discipline \nemployees, can be deliberate conduct, but only if policymakers \nconsciously ignored evidence of the deficiency and dismissed an opportunity to fix it \u2014that is, if they showed \u201c deliberate \n \n9 See Curley v. Klem , 298 F.3d 271, 278 (3d C ir. 2002) (\u201c [F]actual disputes often need to \nbe resolved before determining whether the defendant \u2019s conduct violated a clearly established \nconstitutional right .\u201d). \n \n10 See Williams v. City of York, Pa., 967 F.3d 252, 261 (3d Cir. 2020) ( \u201cA plaintiff alleging \nthat one or more officers engaged in unconstitutional  conduct must establish the personal \ninvolvement of each named defendant to survive summary judgment and take that defendant to trial.\u201d (quotation omitted)).  \n \n11 Bielevicz v. Dubinon , 915 F.2d 845, 850 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing Monell v. New York City \nDep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978)).  \n \n12 Bd. of Cty. Comm \u2019rs v. Brown , 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).   6 \n indifference\u201d  to individuals \u2019 constitutional rights.13  To survive a \nmotion to dismiss, a plaintiff is not required to identify the specific \ncustom and it s inadequacy,14 but the complaint must still contain \nfacts supporting both a plausible inference that there is a policy or custom that caused plaintiff \u2019s injury and a plausible inference that \nthe municipality was the deliberate, moving force behind it. \n Plaintiff \u2019s Compl aint does neither.  The Complaint alleges \nthat (1) nearly twenty years ago, some New Castle County officers allegedly mistook an individual for a burglar during a stakeout, but the resulting lawsuit resulted in a verdict for the officers; (2) ten years ago , different New Castle County officers allegedly raided the \nwrong home, and the resulting lawsuit was resolved with a stipulation of dismissal; (3) five years ago, different New Castle County officers allegedly used excessive force when they responded to a call for a medical emergency, and the resulting lawsuit was \nresolved with a stipulation of dismissal; and (4) last year, an individual sued New Castle County officers and the County for allegedly using significant physical force while arresting him, but the court dismissed the individual \u2019s Monell  claim against the County \nbecause the complaint failed to allege a pattern of violations or an obvious need for more training.\n15 \n Those allegations do not plausibly suggest that New Castle \nCounty has a policy or custom that led to the Fourth Amendment violations alleged here.  At best, the Complaint identifies four sporadic Fourth Amendment violations by different county officers \nover a twenty- year period, and none of the facts alleged in those \ncases resembles the i ntrusion alleged in this case.  Nor does the \nComplaint contain any facts plausibly suggesting that the County was aware of and/or deliberately indifferent to the need for officer training.  Even if the Court assumed the truth of every allegation in the cit ed cases, the nature of the alleged misconduct demonstrates \n \n13 City of Canton v. Harris , 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989); Carter v. City of Philadelphia, 181 \nF.3d 339, 356\u201357 (3d Cir. 1999). \n \n14 Carter , 181 F.3d at 356\u2013 57. \n \n15 Plaintiff incorrectly said in his Complaint that Brown v. Evans , C.A. No. 21- 651-SB, is \nongoing against New Castle County.  Brown\u2019 s claims against the County were dismissed on \nOctober 25, 2021, for failure to allege a plainly obvious need for more training or a pattern of \nviolations.  (C.A. No. 21- 651, D.I. 17 at 11\u201312.)   7 \n no pattern that would put the county on notice that more officer \ntraining was needed.16  \n  Plaintiff \u2019s Monell  claim fails.  \n   \nII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated  above,  Defendants \u2019 Motion to D ismiss (D.I. 9) should be  \nGRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED -IN-PART:  \n1. As to Counts I and IV , the motion should be DENIED for John Doe #1 but \nGRANTED for John Doe #2. \n2. The motion should be GRANTED as to Counts II  and V\u2013XII.  \n3. The only claims that should proceed are  Counts I and IV (against John Doe #1) and \nCount III (against John Doe #1 and John Doe #2).  All claims against Defendants New Castle \nCounty and John Doe #3 should be dismissed without prejudice.   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B),  (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.  Any \nobjections to the Report and Recommendation shall be filed within fourteen days and limited to \nten pages.  Any response shall be filed within fourteen days thereafter and limited to ten pages.  The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo  \nreview in the district court.   \n \n16 To plausibly suggest deliberate indifference, a complaint m ust contain allegations \nsuggesting a pattern of similar, preventable violations or a specific need for additional training \u201c so \nobvious[] and . . . so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights[] that the policymakers \n. . . can be reasonably said to be deliberately indifferent to the need.\u201d   Thomas v. Cumberland \nCounty , 749 F.3d 217, 224 (3d Cir. 2014); see also Carter , 181 F.3d at 356\u201357 (reversing dismissal \nof Monell  claim when complaint alleged pattern of similar constitutional violations that reasonably \nsuggested officers received inadequate training about perjury).  8 \n The parties a re directed to the Court \u2019s \u201cStanding Order for Objections Filed Under Fed.
