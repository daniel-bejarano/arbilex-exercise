No. 21-1705-GBW \nDOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION , \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiff Mia Woodruff asserts claims of gender-based harassment and discrimination \narising out of her employment relationship with her former employer , Dolgencorp , LLC (\"Dollar \nGeneral\").1 In working for Dollar General, Ms. Woodruff voluntarily agreed to resolve \nemployment disputes in arbitration pursuant to two separate valid and enforceable Dollar General \nEmployee Arbitration Agreements (collectively, the \"Arbitration Agreements \"). Because her \nclaims are arbitrable , Ms. Woodruff will be compelled to arbitration and this action stayed pending \nthat arbitration. \nI. BACKGROUND \nMs. Woodruff worked for Dollar General between 2017 and 2019, commencing and ending \nher employment on two separate occasions. D.I. 12; 13-1 1 3. Prior to starting both periods of \nemployment , Ms. Woodruff signed two Arbitration Agreements with Dollar General-the first on \n1 Dollar General explains ( and Ms. Woodruff does not dispute) that the proper defendant \nto this action is Dolgencorp , LLC as the entity that employed Ms. Woodruff. D.I. 11 at n. 1. November 4, 2017, and the second on September 6, 2018. D.I. 12-3, 12-4.2 The Arbitration \nAgreements , identical in form except for the dates of execution, state: \nYou agree that, with the exception of certain excluded claims described below, any \nlegal claims or disputes that you may have against Dollar General, its parent and \nsubsidiary corporations , employees , officers and directors arising out of your \nemployment with Dollar General or termination of employment with Dollar \nGeneral (\"Covered Claim\" or \"Covered Claims\") will be addressed in the manner \ndescribed in this Agreement. You also understand that any Covered Claims that \nDollar General may have against you related to your employment will be addressed \nin the manner described in this Agreement. \n[ ... ] \nThe procedures in this Agreement will be the exclusive means ofresolving Covered \nClaims relating to or arising out of your employment or termination of employment \nwith Dollar General, whether brought by you or Dollar General. This includes, but \nis not limited to, claims alleging violations of wage and hour laws, state and federal \nlaws prohibiting discrimination , harassment , and retaliation , claims for defamation \nor violation of confidentiality obligation s, claims for wrongful termination , tort \nclaims, and claims alleging violation of any other state or federal laws, except \nclaims that are prohibited by law from being decided in arbitration , and those claims \nspecifically excluded in the paragraph below. \nCovered Claims do not include claims for unemplo yment insurance benefits, \nworkers' compensation benefits[workers ' compensation discrimination and \nretaliation claims are Covered Claims], whistleblower claims under the Sarbanes\u00ad\nOxley Act, and claims for benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct. Covered Claims also do not include claims pending in court as of the date this \nAgreement is signed by you, and claims concernin g the scope or enforceability of \nthis Agreement. \n[ ... ] \nYou expressly waive your right to file a lawsuit in court against Dollar General \nasserting any Covered Claims. You also waive your right to a jury trial. Dollar \nGeneral waives its right to file a lawsuit for any Covered Claims it may have \nagainst you, and Dollar General waives its right to a jury trial. \n2 Although Ms. Woodruff states she does not remember signing the Arbitration \nAgreements , she \"acknowledge[s] that Ex. B looks familiar and ... recall[s] that at the onboardin g \nprocess in November of 2017.\" D.I. 13-1 ,r 6. She does not otherwise argue that she was not a \nsignatory to these agreements. \n2 Id. at 1-2. \nWhile employed by Dollar General, Ms. Woodruff alleges that her manager \"touched her \nbody and pressed her breasts up against Ms. Woodruff on more than one occasion.\" D.I. 1 1 7. \nMs. Woodruff avers that she \"asked her manager not to do this but she continued to do it three \nmore times\" and, as a result ofrefusing her advances , Ms. Woodruff's manager allegedly \"teased \nher, degraded her, and called her names in front of other employees.\" Id. 1 9. Ms. Woodruff \nexplains that even though she reported her managers ' conduct to \"Dollar General Corporation \nverbally twice, both through her assistant manager and via the Employee Complaint Hotline,\" Id. \n1 10, \"Dollar General failed to appropriatel y respond.\" Id. 1 11. According to Ms. Woodruff , \nDollar General told her \"they did not have to like each other but do have to work together.\" Id. 1 \n12. As a result of Dollar General's purported inaction, Ms. Woodruff explains that she \"had no \nchoice but to resign in order to avoid further sexual harassment \" and did so \"on November or \nDecember 2019.\" Id. 111-16.3 \nMs. Woodruff states that, in December 2019, she submitted a Charge of Discrimination to \nthe Delaware Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(\"EEOC\") against \"all Defendants. \" Id. 1 4.4 She explains that, on July 13, 2021, the Delaware \nDepartment of Labor sent her a \"Final Determination and Right to Sue Notice and Reasonable \nCause Determination and Notice of Mandatory Conciliation.\" Id. 15. She claims Dollar General \ndid not participate in conciliation and, therefore , the \"Department of Labor Right to Sue became \n3 According to Dollar General, Ms. Woodruff's employment was terminated on April 30, \n2019 \"for walking off the job without notice.\" D.I. 1215. \n4 While Ms. Woodruff states that the Charge of Discrimination was directed \"against all \nDefendants ,\" D.I. 1 1 4, she does not identify the specific entities charged. The Court assumes \nMs. Woodruff directed her action against either Dollar General Corporation or Dolgencorp , LLC. \n3 effective on July 30, 2021.\" Id She also explains that, on September 30, 2021, the EEOC sent her \n\"a Dismissal and Notice of Rights with respect to her claim against Defendant.\" Id \nMs. Woodruff initiated this action on December 2, 2021, asserting claims of gender-based \nharassment and discrimination in violation Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 \n2000(e), et seq. and the Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act, 19 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 710, et seq. \nD.I. 1. Dollar General now moves for an order (1) compelling Ms. Woodruff to arbitrate her claims \nagainst Dollar General and (2) dismissing or staying these proceedings pending arbitration (the \n\"Motion\"). D.I. 10. Dollar General's Motion has been fully briefed. D.I. 11, 13, 14. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) reflects the 'national policy favoring arbitration and \nplaces arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts. \"' In re Remicade (Direct \nPurchaser) Antitrust Litig., 938 F.3d 515, 519 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting Buckeye Check Cashing, \nInc. v. Cardegna , 546 U.S. 440, 443 (2006)). It requires that the Court, \"upon being satisfied that \n[an] issue involved in [a] suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration \" under an arbitration \nagreement, \"shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such \narbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement .... \" 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. \nTo determine whether an issue in a suit or proceeding is \"referable to arbitration, \" courts \n\"must consider two 'gateway' questions : (1) 'whether the parties have a valid arbitration \nagreement at all' (i.e., its enforceability) , and (2) 'whether a concededly binding arbitration clause \napplies to a certain type of controvers y' (i.e., its scope).\" Remicade , 938 F.3d at 519 (quoting \nLamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 139 S. Ct. 1407, 1416-17 (2019)). Subject to certain exceptions , state \nlaw governs both questions . Id at 522; Jaludi v. Citigroup , 933 F.3d 246,254 (3d Cir. 2019). \n4 III. DISCUSSION \nMs. Woodruff argues that the Arbitration Agreements are unenforceable in view of the \nEnding Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EF AA). D.I. \n13 at 2. Alternatively , Ms. Woodruff argues that \"the contract is voidable because Ms. Woodruff \ndid not understand what it meant and so lacked the capacity to assent to its terms.\" Id. at 1. The \nCourt does not find the Arbitration Agreements unenforceable or voidable, and concludes that their \nscope encompasses Ms. Woodruff s claims. \nA. The Arbitration Agreements Are Enforceable and the EFAA Does Not Apply \nRetroactively \nUnder the EF AA, \" ... at the election of the person alleging conduct constituting a sexual \nharassment dispute or sexual assault dispute . . . no predispute arbitration agreement ... shall be \nvalid or enforceable with respect to a case which is filed under Federal [or] State law and relates \nto the ... sexual harassment dispute or the sexual harassment dispute.\" 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).5 The \nEF AA, however, \"shall apply with respect to any dispute or claim that arises or accrues on or after \nthe date of enactment of this Act.\" EFAA, Pub. L. No. 117-90, 136 Stat. 26 (2022) (codified at 9 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 402). The EFAA was enacted on March 3, 2022. Id. \nHere, because the EF AA does not apply retroactively , it cannot save Ms. Woodruff from \narbitration. Ms. Woodruff explains that she \"worked for Dollar General Corporation in \napproximately 2018 or 2019\", D.I. 1 1 7, and that her manager's conduct occurred during her \nemployment, continuing until Ms. Woodruff resigned \"in order to avoid further sexual \n5 Congress defined \"predispute arbitration agreement \" as \"any agreement to arbitrate a \ndispute that had not yet arisen at the time of the making of the agreement.\" 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1). A \n\"sexual assault dispute\" means \"a dispute involving a nonconsensual sexual act or sexual contact.\" \n9 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3). A \"sexual harassment dispute\" is a dispute \"relating to conduct that is alleged \nto constitute sexual harassment.\" 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(4). \n5 harassment. \" Id.~ 14; see also id. at 8-16. In December 2019, Ms. Woodruff filed her Charge of \nDiscrimination with the EEOC, and the complaint to this Court was filed on December 2, 2021. \nD.I. 1. All of these dates are before March 3, 2022, when the EFAA was enacted. Accordingly , \nthe EF AA cannot be applied to Ms. Woodruff's case. See, e.g., Steinberg v. Capgemini Am., Inc., \nC.A. No. 22-489, 2022 WL 3371323, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 16, 2022) (compelling to arbitration \nsexual harassment claims accruing before EFAA's enactment). \nWhile Ms. Woodruff acknowledges that the EF AA \"technically\" does not apply to this \naction, she argues that the Court \"should not enforce the Agreement because it contravenes public \npolicy.\" D.I. 13 at 2. Ms. Woodruff declines to develop this theory other than to state that, \"[a] \nlaw need not explicitly make a contract illegal in order for the Court to find that [the] contract is \nin violation of public policy as expressed by the law.\" Id Unfortunately , if Congress had intended \narbitration agreements like the one Ms. Woodruff signed to be covered by the EF AA-that is, held \ninvalid or unenforceable based on public policy-it would have enacted a law with retroactive \ncoverage. Ms. Woodruff cannot ask the Court to do what the EF AA proscribes . See, e.g., Tantaros \nv. Fox News Network, LLC., C.A. No. 19-7131 (ALC), 2022 WL 4614755, at *2 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept. 30, 2022) (\"The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of \n2021. That law, signed into law on March 3, 2022, well after Plaintiffs arbitration agreement and \nlawsuit, does not apply retroactively ; it cannot be used to shield Plaintiff from arbitration. \"). \nB. Ms. Woodruff Did Not Plead That the Agreements Are Voidable or That She \nLacked Contractual Capacity \nCiting to Delaware law, Ms. Woodruff argues that, \"[t]his Court should not enforce a pre\u00ad\ndispute arbitration agreement that was beyond ... [her understanding] when she applied for her \njob at Dollar General\" because she is \"uneducated and unsophisticated\" and, therefore , \"did not \n6 understand the Agreement even if she did click that she agreed.\" D.I. 13 at 3. Under Delaware6 \nlaw, \"(a]dults are presumed to have contractual capacity and the burden of proving otherwise rests \nwith the party alleging incapacity.\" Bettis v. Premier Pool & Prop. Mgmt., LLC, C.A. No. 6858-\nVCN, 2012 WL 4662225, at *2 (Del. Ch. Sept. 26, 2012). Here, Ms. Woodruff pleads no facts \nrelated to any claim of contractual incapacity , and she \"may not amend [her] complaint through \n(her] opposition brief.\" Schiavo v. Carney, 548 F. Supp. 3d 437, 441 n.3 (D. Del. 2021), aff'd, \nNo. 21-2368, 2021 WL 6550638 (3d Cir. Nov. 18, 2021). \nMoreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has observed : \"It will not do for a (person] to enter into \na contract, and, when called upon to respond to its obligations , to say that [s]he did not read it \nwhen (s]he signed it, or did not know what it contained.\" Upton v. Tribilcock, 91 U.S. 45, 50 \n(1875). In the Third Circuit, \"(a]rbitration agreements in the employment context are not exempt \nfrom this principle. \" Morales, 541 F.3d at 223. It was Ms. Woodruffs \"obligation to ensure [s]he \nunderstood the Agreement[s] before signing.\" Morales v. Sun Constructors, Inc., 541 F.3d 218, \n223 (3d Cir. 2008). That she did not cannot excuse her obligations thereunder. Therefore, Ms. \nWoodruffs argument that there \"is no Binding Agreement\" due to lack of capacity fails. \nC. Ms. Woodruff's Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Arbitration Agreements \nIn determining whether the particular dispute falls within a valid arbitration agreement 's \nscope, 'there is a presumption of arbitrability( .]' \"Century Indem. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at \nLloyd's, London, 584 F.3d 513, 524 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting AT & T Techs., Inc. v. \nCommunications Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643,650 (1986)). This presumption applies whenever \na contract has an arbitration clause and is \"particularly applicable where the clause is [] broad.\" \n6 Although the Arbitration Agreements do not appear to contain a choice of law provision , \nboth parties cite to Delaware authority in evaluating their validity. See D .I. 11 at 11; D .I. 13 at 3. \n7 Monfared v. St. Luke's Univ. Health Network, 767 F. App'x 377, 379 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting AT \n& TTechs., Inc., 475 U.S. at 650)). \"'Any doubts as to the scope ofarbitratable issues should be \nresolved in favor of arbitration ... \"' Suter v. Munich Reinsurance Co., 223 F.3d 150, 155 (3d Cir. \n2000) (quoting Pattern Sec. Corp. v. Diamond Greyhound & Genetics, Inc., 819 F.2d 400, 405-\n407 (3d Cir. 1987)). When the presumption applies, \"a court may not deny a motion to compel \narbitration 'unless it may be said with positive assurance that the ... arbitration clause is not \nsusceptible of an interpretation that covers the dispute.' \" Cup v. Ampco Pittsburgh Corp., 903 \nF.3d 58, 64-65 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting AT & T Techs., Inc., 475 U.S. at 650). \"If ... the court \ndetermines that an agreement exists and that the dispute falls within the scope of the agreement , it \nthen must refer the matter to arbitration without considering the merits of the dispute.\" \nPaineWebber Inc. v. Hartmann, 921 F.2d 507, 511 (3d Cir. 1990) (overruled on other grounds) \n(citing AT & T Techs., Inc., 475 U.S. at 649). \nHere, the Arbitration Agreements apply to \"any legal claims or disputes that you may have \nagainst Dollar General, its parent and subsidiary corporations , employees, officers and directors \narising out of your employment with Dollar General or termination of employment with Dollar \nGeneral\" and specifically include \"claims alleging violations of ... state and federal laws \nprohibiting discrimination , harassment , and retaliation . . . and claims alleging violation of any \nother state or federal laws.\" D.I. 12-3, 12-4. The Third Circuit has enforced similarly broad \nlanguage. See, e.g., Blair v. Scott Specialty Gases, 283 F.3d 595, 603 (3d Cir. 2002) (finding \narbitration enforceable for \"any dispute aris[ing] from ... employment\"). Ms. WoodrufI's \ncomplaint and her affidavit accompanying her Opposition Brief confirm that her claims \"aris[ e] \nout of [her] employment with Dollar General\" and, thus, fall within the scope of the Arbitration \n8 Agreements.See , e.g.,D.I.1117-16;D .I.13-113.7 Therefore ,Ms. Woodruff must arbitrate them. \nPaine Webber, 921 F.2d at 511. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Dollar General's Motion is granted and Ms. Woodruff is \ncompelled to arbitration. Because the FAA requires district courts to stay proceedings pending \narbitration, rather than dismiss claims outright, this action will be stayed pending arbitration. See \nNino v. Jewelry Exch. , Inc., 609 F.3d 191,208 n.7 (3d Cir. 2010) (district court erred by granting \ndefendant's motion to dismiss rather than staying claims pending results of arbitration). Dollar \nGeneral may move to lift the stay and dismiss this action if Ms. Woodruff does not pursue her \nclaims in arbitration. \n* * * \nAt Wilmington this 19th day of December , 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Dismiss Or, Alternatively , Stay All \nProceedings Pending Arbitration is GRANTED. D.I. 10. This case is STAYED \npending the results of the arbitration. Defendant may move to lift the stay and \ndismiss this action if Plaintiff does not pursue her claims in arbitration. \n2. The parties SHALL FILE a status report every six months, or within one week of \nthe arbitration decision, whichever comes frrst. \nGREGOR B. WILLIAMS \nUNITED ST ATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n7 Indeed, Ms. Woodruff does not dispute (and thus, concedes) that her claims lie within \nthe Arbitration Agreements' scope. See generally D.I. 13. \n9 "}
