PICKLE ,     : \n      : \n   Petitioner,   : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1041- RGA  \n      : \nROBERT MAY, Warden, and   : \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE   : \nSTATE OF DELAWARE,    : \n      : \n   Respondent s.   : \n______________________________________________________________________________    \nMEMORANDUM  \nI. BACKGROUND   \n On April 2, 2014, Petitioner pled guilty in the Delaware Superior Court to five counts of \nthird degree rape.  He was  immediately  sentenced to 125 years in prison, suspended after twenty -\nfive years for decreasing levels of supervision.   See Pickle v. May, 2021 WL 3726012, at *1 (D. \nDel. Aug. 23, 2021).  Petitioner did not appeal his convictions or sentence.  See id . \nOn December 17, 2014, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a motion for \npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u201d).  \nSee Pickle, 2021 WL 3726012, at *1.  After holding an evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on December 4, 2017.  See id.  Petitioner filed a notice of appeal, but the Delaware Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as untimely filed on January 24, 2018.  See id.   \nIn July 2018, Petitioner filed in this Court a habeas Petition challenging his 2014 \nconvictions , asserting the following grounds for relief: (1) the police violated Petitioner\u2019s \nconstitutional rights by stacking the charges against him , failing to charge the victim with sexual 2 \n extortion and rape, and failing to look at evidence (an iPhone and an iPad) that would have \nshown that the victim was the aggressor; (2) the State violated Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights by stereotyping Petitioner because of his age and sexual orientation, failing to timely indict Petitioner, and failing to look into Petitioner\u2019s or the victim\u2019s mental health issues; (3) defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by discriminating against Petitioner becaus e of his age \nand also by failing to: (a) meet with Petitioner in time to prepare his case; (b) investigate and take Petitioner\u2019s defense seriously; and (c) look into Petitioner\u2019s mental health issues; and (4) the \nSuperior Court violated Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights by misplacing documents, failing to \nacknowledge and consider Petitioner\u2019s defense, failing to address Petitioner\u2019s mental health issues, and failing to adequately establish the voluntariness of Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea.  ( See D.I. \n7 in Pickle v. May , Civ. A. No. 18- 680-RGA)  The Court denied the petition after determining \nthat all four grounds were procedurally barred from habeas review .  (See D.I. 7 at 10- 14 in Pickle \nv. May , Civ. A. No. 16- 680-RGA)  \nIn August 2022, Petitioner filed  in this Court the instant  Petiti on for a Writ of Habeas \nCorpus Purs uant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) challenging his 2014 convictions .  (D.I. 3)  The \nPetition asserts  the following  two grounds for relief : (1) defense counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to adequately investigate whether Petitioner\u2019s Asperger Syndrome \u201cleft [him] with insufficient willpower to choose whether to do the act or refrain from doing it \nalthough [he was] physically capable of refraining from the doing the act\u201d (id. at 3); and (2) \ndefense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to investigate whether Petitioner\u2019s statement to the police was involuntary because it was the \u201cresult of coercive gover nment 3 \n misconduct\u201d ( id. at 6).   Petitioner has also filed a Motion to Appoint Counsel (D.I. 5) and a \nMotion for Forensic Psychological  Evaluations (D.I. 6).   \nII.   LEGAL STANDARDS  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)( 3)(A ), a petitioner must seek authorization from the \nappropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive habeas petition in a district \ncourt.  See Burton v. Stewart , 549 U.S. 147, 152 (2007) ; Rule 9, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a72254.    \nNotably, a  petition fo r habeas relief is not considered to be \u201csecond or successive simply \nbecause it follows an earlier federal petition.\u201d  Benchoff v. Colleran, 404 F.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. \n2005) .  Rather, a habeas petition is classified as second or successive within the meaning of  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244 if a prior petition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new petitions challenge the same conviction, and the new petition asserts a claim that was, or could have been, \nraised in a prior habeas petition.  See Benchoff , 404 F.3d at 817;  In re Olabode , 325 F.3d 166, \n169-73 (3d Cir. 2003).  If a habeas petitioner erroneously files a second or successive habeas \npetition \u201cin a district court without the permis sion of a court of appeals, the district court\u2019s only \noption is to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.\u201d  Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir. 2002).   III.   DISCUSSION   \n The dismissal of Pet itioner's first petition as procedurally barred from habeas review \nconstitutes an adjudication on the merits  for second or successive habeas purposes .   See Jackson \nv. Johnson, 2015 WL 5005795, at *1 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2015) .  The instant Petition challenges \nthe same 2014 convictions that were challenged in his  first petition, and the instant Petition also \nasserts claims that were or could have been asserted in his first petition.   See Benchoff , 404 F.3d 4 \n at 817- 18.  As a result , the Court concludes that the instant Petition constitutes a second or \nsuccessive habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.   \nPetitioner does not allege, and the record does not indicate, that the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals authorized the filing o f the instant second or successive habeas Petition.  Consequently, \nthe Court concludes that it  lacks jurisdiction to consider the Petition .  See  Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \n\u00a7 2254; Robinson, 313 F.3d at 139.  The Court further concludes that it would not be  in the  \ninterest of justice to transfer this case to the Third Circuit, because nothing in the Petition comes \nclose to satisfying the substantive requirements for a second or successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2).  Accordingly, the Court will di smiss the Petition for lack of jurisdiction , \nand will dismiss  as moot  the pending Motion to Appoint Counsel and Motion for Forensic \nPsychological Evaluations.\n1 \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n For the reasons  set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition for \nlack of jurisdiction  and the pending Motions  as moot .  The Court will also decline to issue a \ncertificate of appealability because Petitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial show ing of the  \ndenial of a constitutional right.\u201d  See  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United \nStates v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997).  A separate Order will be entered.  \n  \nSeptember  23, 2022                                  /s/ Richard G. Andrews _____________                                                                 \n      UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n \n \n1Although al so rendered moot  by the Court\u2019s dismissal of the instant Petition, the Court advises \nPetitioner to disregard  the Order dated September 21, 2022 imposing a partial filing fee.
