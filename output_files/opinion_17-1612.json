Presently before the Cour t is the matter of claim construction.  (D.I. 179; D.I. \n184)  The Court recommends that the District Court adopt the construc tions set forth below.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nChemours c ommenced th is action on November 8, 2017.  (D.I. 1)  On December 21, \n2018, the case was stayed pending completion of inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) proceedings  \ninvolving the asserted patents.  ( See D.I. 77 at 32- 33)  On November 12, 2019, the United States \nPatent and Trademark Office\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal B oard (\u201cPTAB\u201d) issued two Final \nWritten Decisions finding all claims of both asserted patents unpatentable.  ( See D.I. 80 at 2)  \nChemours appealed  these decisions, and on July 22, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit  reversed the PTAB\u2019s unpatentability decisions.  ( Id.); see also Chemours Co. \nFC, LLC v. Daikin Indus., Ltd., 4 F.4th 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2021) .   2 On August 3, 2021, the District Court lifted the stay of the case.  (D.I. 81)  The cas e was \nthereafter referred to the Court by United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika to hear and \nresolve all pretrial matters  up to and including expert discovery mat ters.  (D.I. 98 )  A trial is set \nto begin on July 11, 2022.  (D.I. 87 at \u00b6  20)  \nThe asserted patents are directed to specific fluorinated ethylene propylene (\u201cFEP\u201d) \npolymer compositions that are used to insulate communications cables.  ( See D.I. 153 at 1, 3)  \nBoth patents are entitled \u201cHigh Melt Flow  Fluoropolymer ,\u201d and they claim priority to an \napplication filed on May 14, 2003.  ( D.I. 158, exs. 1- 2)1  The specification explains that prior to \nthe invention, there was a need for FEPs capable of being extruded at high speeds while still \nproducing a high quality wire coating.  ('609 patent, col. 1: 10-49)  The inventors of the asserted \npatents created an FEP  that can be processed at high speeds and over a broad range of operating \nconditions.  ( Id., Abstract ; id., col. 1:53- 62)  The claimed FE P has:  (1) a minimal concentration \nof alkali metal salt; (2) a high melt flow rate; and (3) a low number of unstable e nd groups .  (Id.; \nsee also D.I. 153 at 1)     \nChemours alleges that Daikin\u2019s copolymers , including Neoflon\u00ae FE P NP-1108, Neoflon \nFEP NP-1109 and Neoflon FEP NP -3180, infringe certain claims of the asserted patents.  ( D.I. \n13 at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 51)  Further details regarding the asserted patent s will be provided below in Section \nIII.    \nOn October 15, 2021, t he parties filed their joint c laim c onstruction brief .  (D.I. 153)   \nBoth parties subsequently submitted Notices of Supplemental Evidence in support of their claim \n \n 1  The asserted patents appear on the docket in this action more than once.  The two \npatents -in-suit share the same specification.

(D.I. 197; D.I. 213)  The Court conducted a Ma rkman hearing on November \n16, 2021.  (D.I. 246 (hereinafter, \u201cTr.\u201d) )  In December 2021, Daikin submitted a Notice of \nSupplemental Authority in support of  its claim construction positions .  (D.I. 241)  \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n The Court has often set out the relevant legal standard for claim construction, including \nin Vytacera Bio LLC v. CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. , Civil Action No. 20- 333-LPS-CJB, 2021 WL \n4621866, at *2- 3 (D. Del. Oct. 7, 2021).  The Court hereby incorporates by reference its \ndiscussion in Vytacera Bio of th ese legal standards and will follow the m herein.  To the extent \nconsideration of the disputed terms here necessitates discussion of other, related legal principles, \nthe Court will discuss those principles in Se ction III below.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The parties set out three  disputed terms or sets of terms (hereinafter, \u201cterms\u201d) for the \nCourt\u2019s review.  Th e Court  takes up the terms  in the order in which they were argued.    \n A. \u201cmelt flow rate \u201d  \n The first disputed term , \u201cmelt flow rate \u201d (also referred to as \u201cMFR\u201d below) , appears , \ninter alia , in claims 1 and 2 of the '609 patent and claims 3 and 4 (as depending from claim 1) of \nthe '431 patent .  The parties\u2019 competing proposed constructions for \u201c melt flow rate \u201d are set out in \nthe chart below:   \nTerm   Plaintiff \u2019s Proposed \nConstruction  Defendants \u2019 Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201cmelt flow rate \u201d   Plain and ordinary meaning, \nwhich is \u201cthe amount of mass \nor volume of a viscous material moving past a \u201cthe rate of extrusion of \nmolten resins through a die of specified length and diameter under prescribed conditions \nof temperature, load, and 4 reference point as a function \nof time\u201d  piston position in the barrel as \nthe timed measurement is \nbeing made, in accordance with ASTM D- 1238 and \nASTM D -2116\u201d \n (D.I. 153 at 3 2-33)  The parties \u2019 dispute with respect to this term is whether it should be \nconstrued to require measurements made in accordance with specific industry standards  (i.e., \nASTM D- 1238 and ASTM D -2116, or the \u201cASTM standards\u201d ).  (See i d. at 35- 36; Tr. at 11, 14)   \nChemours argues that it is not necessary to import into the claims various limitations relating to \ntesting methods set out in the ASTM standards ; Daikin asserts that the proper construction of \n\u201cmelt flow rate\u201d requires reference to such standards .  (D.I. 153 at 35- 36, 47 ; Tr. at 11)  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court concludes that the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d does not align with D aikin\u2019s proposed construction.     \nAs an initial matter, in order to determin e the correct  answer here, it is important to first \nunderstand what the se ASTM standards actually are.  I t is undisputed that ASTM D -1238 is a \ntest method  that is used measure melt flow rate.  (D.I. 153 at 34- 35; D.I. 155, ex. 28 at \nDKN0001130;  Tr. at 17, 48)  It is also undisputed that the specification of the asserted patents \nstates that \u201c[t]he melt flow rates (MFR) of FEP copolymers are determined in accordance with ASTM D1238[.]\u201d  ( '609 patent, col. 2:38- 39; see also D.I. 153 at 34- 36; see also Tr. at 62 \n(Chemours \u2019 counsel acknowledging that \u201cI agree that [the] person skilled in the art reading the \npatent in [light of] the specification understands  that [ the] melt flow rate is determined using the \nASTM standard\u201d) )\n2   \n \n 2  The ASTM D -2116 standard defines FEPs and states that the melt flow rate is \ndetermined by the test method described in ASTM D -1238.  (D.I. 155, ex. 29 at \u00b6\u00b6 1.1, 11.1.1)  \nThe ASTM D -2116 standard is not mentioned in the patents.  ( See D.I. 153 at 35)  \n 5 Understanding this then, and absent strong evide nce in the record to the contrary, it does \nnot seem right to say that a test method  used to measure  a property ( i.e., \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d) would \namount to the plain and ordinary meaning of t he property  itself.  (D.I. 153 at 35; Tr. at 18, 26- 27)  \nChemours  agrees, and asserts that a person of ordinary skill in the art (\u201cPOSITA\u201d) would instead \nunderstand the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d  to be simply  \u201cthe amount of mass \nor volume of a viscous material . . . [ moving]  past a reference point as a function of time.\u201d  (D.I. \n153 at 33- 34 (citing D.I. 158, ex. 8 at \u00b6 26))3     \n Turning next  to the intrinsic record, the claim s\u2019 language provides  support  for C hemours\u2019 \nproposed construction.  Claim 1 of the '431 patent  recites an FEP composition \u201chaving a melt \nflow rate of within the range of about 30\u00b13 g/10 min as determined by ASTM D1238 at 372\u00b0  \nC[.]\u201d  ('431 patent, col. 10: 13-14)  The reference to ASTM D -1238 was added by the patentee in \nresponse to a rejection by the E xaminer during prosecution of  the '431 patent .  (D.I. 154, ex. 18 \nat CHEM00001627, CHEM00001646)  The claim had been drafted without reference to ASTM \nD-1238 or a temperature, and t he Examiner had stated that the language \u201c\u2018 having a melt flow \nrate of within the range of about 30\u00b13 g/10 min\u2019  may render the claim indefinite.  It is unclear \nwhat is the actual temperature measured.  As known in the art, the number of melt flow depends on the  measured temperature very much.\u201d  ( Id. at CHEM00001646)   The patentee then elected to \namend the claim language to include reference to ASTM D1238 and a particular temperature , \ninstead of attempting to travers e the rejection.  ( Id. at CHEM00001627)  Meanwh ile, during \n \n3  Even Daikin\u2019s expert seems to agree that the meaning of melt flow rate, as a \ngeneral matter, is not the same as the test method by which melt flow rate is determined.  (D.I. \n154, ex. 19 at ex. B at \u00b6 49 (Daikin\u2019s expert noting that \u201c[t]he rate at which a melted material can be extruded is known as the melt flow rate\u201d and that melt flow rate \u201cis the measure of the amount of material, after being heated to a specified temperature, that extrudes from a test device in a given amount of time and under a given weight load\u201d))  6 prosecuti on of  the '609 patent, no such indefiniteness rejection was made.  As a result,  claim 1 of \nthat patent recites an FEP composition \u201chaving a melt flow rate of within the range of about \n30\u00b13 g/10 min\u201d \u2014without reference to the ASTM standard  or any particular temperature.  ( See \nD.I. 158, ex. 5; '609 patent, col. 10:20)  \n This claim language in the respective patents help s Chemours\u2019  case, for the following \nreasons : \n\u2022 For one thing, the fact t hat claim 1 of the '431 patent explains \nthat the melt flow rate is \u201c determined  by ASTM D1238 at 372\u00b0  \nC\u201d just seems to underscore the fact that the ASTM standard is \nnot the melt flow rate itself .  Instead,  it is a tool used to \ndetermine the melt flow rate.   (Tr. at 9 -10)4   \n \n\u2022 Additionally, the difference in language between the claims of the '609 patent a nd the '431 patent counsels in favor of \nChemours \u2019 proposed construction.  If the meaning of the term \n\u201cmelt flow rate\u201d inherently included the concept that the  rate \nmust be determined by the ASTM D- 1238 standard at 372\u00b0  C, \nthen there would have been no need for the patentee to separately inject those limitations into the '431 patent  claims, in \norder to overcome the Examiner\u2019s objections.  ( Id. at 50 -51)  \nAnd, of course, the '609 patent\u2019s claims do not contain this \nstandard /temperature language at all.  In the end, when the \npatentee wanted to claim a specific test method for determining  \nmelt flow rate, it knew how to do so (and it knew it had to add additional words to the claims to do so, beyond just \u201cmelt flow \nrate\u201d).   (D.I. 153 at 34- 35); s ee, e.g. , Forest Labs., Inc. v. Teva \nPharms. USA, Inc., C.A. No. 14- 121-LPS, 2016 WL 54910, at \n*7-8 (D. Del. Jan. 5, 2016) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s attempt to \nlimit a term to particular plasma memantine concentration \nprofiles , where other claims in certain of the asserted patents \nspecifically claimed such particular plasma memantine \n \n4  Chemours cites to deposition testimony of one of the inventors of the asserted \npatents , which also emphasizes that the ASTM standard is not the melt flow rate itself.

Aug. 7, 2012)  (rejecting defendants\u2019 attempt to \ndefine \u201ca power switching circuit\u201d with reference to m emory \ncells, where aside from four claims in one asserted patent, the \nother claims in the asserted patents did not contain any reference to memory cells).       \n \n\u2022 Moreover  (and relatedly) , Daikin\u2019s proposed construction, \nwere it correct, would render the reference to ASTM D -1238 in \nthe claims of the '431 patent superfluous .  (D.I. 153 at 44)  This \nfurther indicates that Daikin\u2019s proposal is wrong.  See, e.g., \nMonaghan Med. Corp. v. Smiths Med. ASD, Inc., C.A. No. 17-\n712-LPS-CJB, 2018 WL 3323823, at *4 (D. Del. July 6, 2018) \n(rejecting constructions incorporating additional limitations that were redundant).\n5  \n \nThe Court turns next to the s pecification .  Daikin asserts that its proposal \u201cflows\u201d from \nthe spe cification , because the proposal is consistent with the following excerpt  from the patent : \nThe melt flow rates (MFR) of FEP copolymers are determined in accordance with ASTM D1238.  The MFR of polymers according to this invention are in the range of about 27 to 33 g/10 min, preferably about 28 to 32 g/10 min.  \n (D.I. 153 at 38 (quoting ' 609 patent, col. 2:38- 41), 48; Tr. at 45, 68)  Yet th is excerpt  does not \namount to clear lexicography that narrow s the construction of \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d in the manner \nDaikin suggests.  (D.I. 153 at 45; Tr. at 58- 59)  With regard to the first sentence above, again, it \nspeaks to how melt flow rates are determined , not necessarily to what is the meaning of  the term  \n \n 5  Daikin argues that the claim language of claim 1 of the '609 patent supports its \nproposed construction because the claimed \u201cme lt flow rate\u201d is measured in \u201cg/10 min [,]\u201d which \nis the measurement unit required by ASTM D -1238.  (D.I. 153 at 37; see also D.I. 155, ex. 28 at \n\u00b6 12.1)  But as Chemours retorts, just because the patentee referenced in the claims a mass \nmeasurement of gram s and a period of time that is common in the industry, that does not mean \nthat the patentee intended to import the entirety of the ASTM standard into the \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d limitation.  (D.I. 153 at 45)  8 \u201cmelt flow rate.\u201d  A dditionally, it is not a s if th at first  sentence is clearly definitional; it does not, \nfor example, read:  \u201cAs used herein, melt flow rate shall mean . . .\u201d  (Tr. at 46 -47)  Instead, th e \nsentence notes only that melt flow rates of FEP copolymers \u2014generally \u2014are determined in \naccordance with ASTM D -1238.  It is the second sentence that zeros in on the melt flow rate of \npolymers \u201c according to this invention\u201d ; that sentence simply provides a range of the melt flow \nrate of the claimed polymers \u2014it does not expressly incorporate ASTM D -1238.  ( Id.)  So \nnothing in this excerpt suggests that the patent is providing a clear definition for the term \u201cmelt \nflow rate\u201d  (let alone one that imports the ASTM standards into such a definition) .  See Baxalta \nInc v. Genentech, Inc., 972 F.3d 1341, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\u201cIndeed, the standard for lexicography is exacting, requiring the patentee to clearly express an intent to redefine a term.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citat ion omitted).    \n In sum, the intrinsic record does not support adoption of a narrower construction of \u201cmelt \nflow rate\u201d than is called for by the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning.  Daikin does not seem to \nseriously dispute that \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d is , as a general matter, \u201cthe amount of mass or volume of \na viscous material moving past a reference point as a function of time.\u201d  ( See D.I. 153 at 43, 44; \nTr. at 59)   While Daikin argues that Chemours \u2019 proposal \u201ccontradicts the claim language\u201d since \nthe claims specify \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d as a specific mass unit per a particular time period , (D.I. 153 \nat 43), the Court is not persuaded that this  is a problem , since adoption of Chemours\u2019 \nconstruction for the  term would still mean that the \u201camount of mass or volume of a viscous \nmaterial moving past a reference point as a function of time\u201d of the claimed copolymer is \u201cwithin \nthe range of about 30\u00b13 g/10 min[,]\u201d ( '609 patent, col. 10:19- 20; '431 patent, col. 10: 14-15).6   \n \n 6  It is clear that Daikin believes that Chemours\u2019 co nstruction would render the \nasserted claims indefinite .  (D.I. 153 at 41- 42)  But the Court makes no such finding on this 9 For these reasons, the Court recommends that \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d be construed to mean \u201c the \namount of mass or volume of a viscous material moving past a reference point as a function of \ntime.\u201d  \n B. \u201cabout 30\u00b1 3 g/10 min \u201d/\u201cabout 30\u00b1 2 g/10 min\u201d/\u201cabout\u201d (the \u201cabout\u201d terms) \nClaim 1 of the '609 patent and claims 3 and 4 of the ' 431 patent (as depending from claim \n1) recite a copolymer that has, inter alia , \u201ca melt flow rate of within the range of about 30\u00b1 3 \ng/10 min [.]\u201d  ('609 patent, col. 10:19- 20 (emphasis added) ; '431 patent, col. 10:13- 14, 19- 22 \n(emphasis added) )  Claim 2 of the '609 patent recites a copolymer that has, inter alia , \u201ca melt \nflow rate of within the range of about 30\u00b1 2 g/10 min [.]\u201d  ( '609 patent, col. 10: 22-23 (emphasis \nadded) )  The parties\u2019 proposed constructions for these terms are as follows : \nTerm  Plaintiff\u2019s Propos ed \nConstruction  Defendants\u2019 Proposed \nConstruction  \n\u201cabout\u201d  \u201capproximately\u201d  \u201cabout\u201d must be read in the \ncontext of the term that it \nmodifies, e.g., \u201cabout 30\u00b13 g/10 \nmin\u201d  \n \nrecord.   Such a finding would require clear and convincing evidence, and Daikin has not shown \nby such clear and convincing evidence that th e patentee has failed to inform with reasonable \ncertainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 789 F.3d 1335, 1341, 1344- 45 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (finding that claim 1 was invalid for \nindefiniteness  where it was undisputed that \u201cmolecular weight\u201d could be ascertained by any of \nthree possible measures, but the claims or the specification did not indicate which measure to use, and the term \u201cmolecular weight\u201d did not have plain meaning to one of skill i n the art).  For \nexample, Daikin has not demonstrated that using different methods or conditions with respect to ascertaining melt flow rate would be outcome determinative with respect to infringement.  (D.I. 153 at 47)  Indeed, during the Markman hearing, Daikin confirmed that it was not now \nattempting to make this showing.  (Tr. at 36)   \n  At this stage, then, the Court\u2019s job is simply to construe the claim term at issue and give it \nthe meaning warranted by the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence.  Biosig Instruments, Inc. v. Nautilus, Inc., 783 F.3d 1374, 1377- 78 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ; 0912139 B.C. Ltd. v. Rampion USA \nInc., CASE NO. C18 -1464JLR, 2019 WL 3426058, at *16 (W.D. Wash.

(Id. \nat 52, 56- 57; Tr. at 72)   Specifically, Daikin asserts that \u201cabout\u201d provides, at most, - 1 g/min at \nthe lower end and no increased melt flow rate at the upper end.  (D.I. 153 at 55; see also id. at \n53)7  The Court agrees with Chemours.  \n Generally, a patentee\u2019s use of the term \u201cabout\u201d in connection with a numeric range is \nintended to avoid a \u201cstrict numerical boundary\u201d to the specified parameter.   See, e.g., Par \nPharm., Inc. v. Hospira, Inc., 835 F. App\u2019x 578, 584 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ; Genentech, Inc. v. Amgen \nInc., Civ. No. 18- 924-CFC, Civ. No. 18- 1363- CFC, 2019 WL 2493446, at *9 (D.

Apr. 3, 2018) (\u201cWhere a patentee has not acted as his own lexicographer in redefining \nthe word \u2018about,\u2019 courts have construed \u2018about\u2019 to mean \u2018approximately.\u2019\u201d).   \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that t he patentee did not act as his \nown lexicographer in redefining the term \u201cabout .\u201d  Instead, in claiming a range of \u201cabout 30\u00b13 \u201d \n \n 7  The parties are most focused on the impact of Court\u2019s claim construction on the \nupper end of the range, as that is apparently where a key infringement battle in the case will be \nfought.  (Tr. at 113)  11 (and \u201cabout 30\u00b12\u201d ), the patentee contemplated melt flow rate values  that could be less than 27 \nand greater than 3 3 g/10 min (and less than 28 and great er than 32 g/10 min).    \nIn arguing to the contrary, Daikin first contends that the specification states t hat a precise \nnumerical range is required for the \u201cabout \u201d terms  because it describes a melt flow rate range of \n27-33 g/10 min as being \u201ccritical to the invention.\u201d   (D.I. 153 at 56; see also id. at 54, 73- 74; Tr. \nat 123- 24, 127- 28)  Daikin points in particular to the following portion of the specification, \nwhich describes Example H : \nExample H (The Invention)  \n \n. . . The same result is obtained when the MFR of the copolymer is \nvaried within the range of 28- 32 g/10 min. . . . As the MFR or melt \ntemperature moves out of these ranges, the occurrence of sparks \nand lumps increases drastically .  The MFR range of 30\u00b13 g/10 min \nand melt temperature range of 393\u00b0 C.\u00b16\u00b0  C. include the transition \nfrom acceptable quality to borderline quality, the narrower MFR \nand melt temperature ranges giving the most consistent highest \nquality results.  \n \n('609 pate nt, col. 5: 38-62 (cited in D.I. 153 at 54, 56, 74; Tr. at 123- 24, 127- 28))  According to \nDaikin, this passage , in describing \u201c[ t]he [i]nvention[,]\u201d conveys that the range of 27 to 33 g/10 \nmin is the \u201csweet spot\u201d required for obtaining a copolymer that is of acceptable quality .  (D.I. \n153 at 54, 56; see also Tr. at 123- 24, 127- 28)  Thus, Daikin asserts that the \u201cabout \u201d terms cannot \nbe construed in a way that would extend the range \u201cabove 33 or below 26\u201d because neither is \n\u201c\u2018acceptable[;]\u2019 \u201d expanding beyond this range will drastically increase the occurrence of sparks \nand lumps.  (D.I. 153 at 56-57, 73- 74)8 \n \n 8  Daikin also contends that the specification\u2019s descr iption of Examples E and F \nreinforce its proposed construction.  (D.I. 153 at 73 n.25, 74 n.26)  Example E had a melt flow \nrate of 26 g/10 min that reported \u201cacceptable quality[,]\u201d but at a melt temperature that is \u201cnarrower than the variation in melt temp erature typically present in the industry.\u201d  ( '609 patent, \ncol. 5:15- 22)  Daikin explains that, in light of this example, its proposed construction allows for 12  But even af ter taking into account the specification \u2019s description of Example H ( and of \nthe other examples described therein) , the Court is not convinced that Daikin is correct .  (Id. at \n65-68; Tr. at 90- 91, 94- 99)  To be sure, Example H is entitled \u201c The Invention\u201d  and there is no \ndoubt that what it discloses is meaningful.  But this portion of the patent i s teaching tha t a \nproperty of the polymer ( the melt flow ra te) and a processing condition ( melt temperature ) can \nboth have an important effect  on the production of a copolymer of acceptable quality  or \nunacceptable quality .  ('609 patent, col. 5:56- 62; see also id ., col. 5:40- 51; D.I. 153 at 66- 67 \n(Chemours  noting that \u201cMFR values are [not] included or excluded in a vacuum \u201d); Tr. at 95, 99)  \nFor i nstance, Example G describes a test in which the melt flow rate of the copolymer was 30 \ng/10 min ( thus clearly within the claimed range ); however, the test was processed at a melt \ntemperature of 404 \u00b0 C and  it ultimately produced an insulated conductor of inadequate quality.  \n('609 patent, cols. 4:30- 31, 5:33- 36; see also id ., col. 5: 40-55 (noting that the results from \nExample G differed \u2014and a result of acceptable quality was obtained \u2014when the melt \ntemperature was changed to 393\u00b0  C, and also explaining how other changes to the melt \ntemperature, melt flow rate and draw -down ratio can produce results of acceptable quality) )  \nExample H also explains that when the melt temperature was decreased below 388\u00b0  C or above \n399\u00b0  C, the quality of the conductor becomes unacceptable, even when the melt flow rate of the \npolymer was between 27 g/10 min to 33 g/10 min.  ( Id., cols. 5:58- 6:3)   \n \nthe low end of the claimed range to go down to 26 g/10 min.  (D.I. 153 at 74; Tr. at 129- 30)  \nExample F had a melt flow rate of 35 g/10 min that resulted in \u201cinadequate quality[,]\u201d ( '609 \npatent, col. 5:26- 29), which Daikin contends \u201ccorroborates the specification\u2019s express definition \nof the upper MFR limit for \u2018acceptable quality\u2019 lying between 32- 33 g/10 min[,]\u201d (D.I. 153 at 74 \nn.26).    13  With this in mind, it becomes significant that the patent  claims  do not impose a limitation \nrequiring that a particular melt temperature be used  during processing.  (D.I. 153 at 66; Tr. at 89)  \nMelt temperature is clearly an important  variable in the process of producing high- quality \ninsulated wire \u2014and as set out above , using a too high or t oo low melt temperature can  \n(depending on other variables)  cause a sample to be of poor quality.  One of those variables is \nthe melt flow rate of the polymer.  And what the specification teaches is that if certain particular \nmelt temperature s are used, then it is possible that a melt flow rate of outside of the 27 to 33 g/ 10 \nmin band c ould provide acceptable results .  (D.I. 153 at 65- 66 (\u201c[T ]he Examples are not mere \nvariations of MFR, but instead illustrate the flexibility of the invention by changing various operating conditions.\u201d ); Toro Co. v.

Cir. 2004)  \n(explaining that claims should not be limited to specific nume rical parameters from preferred \nembodiments unless the embodiment is the entire invention presented by the patentee).\n  Indeed, \nthat seems to be what is going on in Example E, where the melt flow rate was 26 g/10 min (i.e., a rate that Example H describes as generally undesirable), but the example still states that insulated conductor of \u201cacceptable quality can be produced \u201d\u2014so long as a \u201cnarrow[]\u201d variation in melt \ntemperature is utilized (one that, admittedly, i s outside of the \u201cvariation . . . typically present in \nthe industry\u201d) .  ('609 patent, col. 5:15- 22)   \n In the end, even Daikin seems to acknowledge that the specification alone  would not \nwarrant narrowing the \u201c about \u201d terms to the precise numerical ranges reflected in its  proposed \nconstructions.  (D.I. 153 at 74 (\u201c[T]he intrinsic record suggests  that the MFR range should \nexclude 33 g/10 min and above[.]\u201d)  (emphasis added) ; Tr. at 152- 53 (Daikin\u2019s counsel noting \nthat th e patentee put \u201cabout\u201d into the claims because it \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be cabined to just 27- 33\u201d \nand because varying the melt temperature can impact the MFR ))  Indeed, back in 2018, before 14 the case was stayed pending IPR  proceedings , Daikin had proposed that the term \u201cabout 30\u00b13 \ng/10 min\u201d be construed to mean \u201cgreater than 2 6 g/10 min and less than 34 g/10 min\u201d and that \nthe term \u201cabout 30\u00b12 g/10 min\u201d be construed to mean \u201cgreater than 27 g/10 min and less than 33 \ng/10 min[,]\u201d  citing to, inter  alia, the description in Example H of the specification in support.  \n(D.I. 62, ex. A at 8 (emphasis added) (cited in D.I. 153 at 53- 54))  Thus, at least at that point, \nDaikin was not arguing that the specification mandated that the claimed melt flow rate could \nnever be above 33 g/10 min.     \nHowever, D aikin now asserts  that during the IPR proceedings , Chemours  \u201cerased any \ndoubt about whether the claims reach MFRs higher than 33 g/10 min[.]\u201d  (D.I. 153 at 74; see \nalso id. at 57 ; Tr. at 133- 35)  According to Daikin, in the  IPR, Chemours \u201c broadly insisted . . . \nthat increasing MFR wou ld impa ir product quality and mechanical properties\u201d and thus \u201ccannot \nnow say that \u2018about 30\u00b13 g/10 min\u2019  permits doing precisely what Chemours insisted skilled \nartisans would never do, increasing MFR beyond the claimed MFR range.\u201d  (D.I. 153 at 76- 77 \n(emphasis in original) ; Tr. at 138)     \n The Court thus turns to Chemours\u2019 statements from the IPR proceedings .  In doing so, it  \nasks:  Do those statements  amount to prosecution disclaim er with respect to the \u201c about \u201d terms ?  \n(See D.I. 153 at 57; Tr. at 141, 148)  \u201cThe doctrine of prosecution disclaimer precludes . . . \npatentees from recapturing through claim interpretation specific meanings disclaimed during \nprosecution.\u201d  SanDisk Corp. v.

Apple Inc. , 856 F.3d 1353, 1361 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Here, the Court concludes that 15 during the IPR proceedings, Chemours did not make a clear and unmistakable argument that the \n\u201cabout \u201d terms should be limited in the manner suggested by Daikin.   \nIn those proceedin gs, Daikin had argued that the patents were obvious over a prior art \nreference called \u201cKaulbach.\u201d  (D.I. 158, ex. 7 at 55)  Kaulbach taught that copolymers should \nhave a melt flow rate of 15 g/10 min or higher, and disclosed a sample with a melt flow ra te of \n24 g/10 min.  ( Id.)  Importantly, t he invention of Kaulbach had a \u201cvery narrow molecular -weight \ndistribution [.]\u201d  (D.I. 154, ex. 15 at col. 3:34- 35; see also id., ex. 12 at 12; D.I. 156, ex. 31 at 26); \nsee also Chemours Co., 4 F.4th at 1375.  Daikin \u2019s position in the IPR proceedings was that it \nwould have been obvious to modify the sample  in Kaulbach  to yield a copolymer with a melt \nflow ra te of 30\u00b13 g/10 min.  (D.I. 158, ex. 7 at 52, 55- 56)   \nThe IPR statements that Daikin points to as amounting to \u201ca [h]ard and [f]ast [n]umeric \n[l]ine\u201d for the upper limit of the \u201c about \u201d terms cannot be viewed in a vacuum.  (D.I. 153 at 76 \n(citing D.I. 156, ex. 31 at 31, 32; id., ex. 32 at 2, 10) ); see also, e.g., Gald erma Labs., L.P. v. \nAmneal Pharms. LLC , 806 F. App\u2019x 1007, 1010 (Fed. Cir. 2020) .  Rather, viewed in proper \ncontext, Chemours\u2019 arguments to the PTAB  were focused on the disclosures in Kaulbach.  In \nother words, Chemours was explaining that, given those disclosures , a POSITA  would not have \nbeen motivated to increase the melt flow ra te of 24  g/10 min referenced in Kaulbach to the range  \nclaimed in the asserted patents \u2014because doing so would involve broadening the molecular \nweight distribution of the polymer .  (D.I. 153 at 69 -71)  To that end, Chemours argued to the \nPTAB that:      \n\u2022 \u201cAs of the invention of the '431 patent, a number of methods \nwere known for adjusting an F EP\u2019s . . . melt flow rate.  But to \navoid the problems discussed above associated with overall \nmolecular weight reduction, these methods often resulted in \nbroadening the molecular weight distribution of the polymer. . . 16 . [T]he conventional wisdom in the art was that a broad \nmolecular weight distribution was necessary to create a \npolymer that could be processed at high speeds, with a high \nmelt flow rate, without sacrificing coating quality [.]\u201d  (D.I. \n156, ex. 31 at 24 -25)  Chemours then provided examples of \ndisclosures that broadened molecular weight distributions to \ncreate copolymers with higher melt flow rate s.  (Id. at 25)   \n \n\u2022 \u201cKaulbach [] recognized that broader molecular weight \ndistributions were typically believed necessary to increase \npolymer melt flo w rate without sacrificing coating quality .\u201d \n(Id.);  \n \n\u2022 \u201cConsistent with his stated goal, Kaulbach teaches against \ncommon practices that were known to broaden the molecular \nweight distribution of a polymer and thereby increase melt \nflow rate .\u201d  (Id. at 26);  \n \n\u2022 Daikin\u2019s expert fails to \u201cexplain why one of skill in the art \nwould be motivated to increase Kaulbach\u2019s melt flow rate \nwhile retaining its narrow molecular weight distribution, in \nlight of the significant drawbacks in coating quality, or how \none of skill would have known how to achieve this objective \nusing ordinary skill and known methods .\u201d  (Id. at 32 -33 \n(emphasis added) ) \n \nSimilarly, in appealing the PTAB\u2019s findings  of obviousness to the Federal Circuit, Chemours \nasserted that \u201c[e]ven if one wanted to increase Kaulbach\u2019s melt flow rate, the known methods for \ndoing so without sacrificing quality involved broadening the molecular weight distribution of the \nFEP.\u201d  (D.I. 157, ex. 33 at 7- 8 (emphasis added) )  The Federal Circuit agreed with Chemours, \nconcluding that  the PTAB , in finding that a POSITA  would have been motivated to increase the \nmelt flow rate of the sample in Kaulbach to within the claimed range, \u201cdid not adequately \ngrapple with why a skilled artisan would find it obvious to increase Kaulbach\u2019s melt flow rate to \nthe claimed range while retaining its critical \u2018very narrow molecular -weight distribution.\u2019\u201d  \nChemours Co., 4 F.4th at 1376 (citation omitted ).   17 In light of this record, Chemours made no clear and unmistakable statement that the \nclaimed invention is limited to the precise numeric range recited in Daikin\u2019s proposed \nconstructions  (or that increasing MFR above 33 g/10 min would always unduly impair product \nquality and mechanical properties ).  Instead , its IPR-related arguments w ere more nuanced \u2014\nthey were specific to the Kaulbach reference and to the interplay between increased melt flow \nrate and its impact on narrow molecular weight distributi on.  (D.I. 153 at 70); see, e.g. , Asetek \nDanmark A/S v. CoolIT Sys. Inc., Case No. 19- cv-00410- EMC, 2020 WL 4207520, at *26 (N.D. \nCal. July 22, 2020)  (finding that the defendant\u2019s statements relating to prior art did not amount to \nclear and unmistakable disclaimer ).   \nIn sum, the intrinsic record does not support an interpretation of  the \u201c about \u201d terms that \nrequires adoption of the precise melt flow rate ranges  reflected in Daikin\u2019s proposals.  And i n the \nabsence of Chemours redefining \u201cabout\u201d to require a precise range, the Co urt agrees that \u201cabout\u201d \nshould be construed to mean \u201capproximately,\u201d  that \u201cabout 30\u00b1 3 g/10 min\u201d be construed to mean \n\u201capproximately 30\u00b1 3 g/10 min\u201d and that \u201cabout 30\u00b1 2 g/10 min\u201d be construed to mean \n\u201capproximately 30\u00b1 2 g/10 min.\u201d   See, e.g., Sun Pharm.

(D.I. 153 at 55, 61)  To this, the Court notes that its rejection of Daikin\u2019s proposed \nconstructions does  resolve at least one claim construction -related dispute between the parties:  it \nmakes clear that the terms are not absolutely limited to a melt flow rate of 33 g/10 min at the \nupper end.  ( Id. at 72)  To the sure, the parties may have other disputes that relate to these terms, \nbut those are infringement  disputes.  And on that score, the issue of whether the accused products \nhave melt flow rates that fall within the claimed range will be a task for the fact -finder to resolve.  \nSee, e.g., PPG Indus. v. Guardian Indus. Corp., 156 F.3d 1351, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 1998) \n(explaining that a court may not, under the rubric of claim construction, \u201cgive a claim whatever \nadditional precision or specifi city is necessary to facilitate a comparison between the claim and \nthe accused product.  Rather, after the court has defined the claim with whatever specificity and \nprecision is warranted by the language of the claim and the evidence bearing on the proper \nconstruction, the task of determining whether the construed claim reads on the accused product is \nfor the finder of fact\u201d); see also Par Pharm., 835 F. App\u2019x at 584 (noting that when \u201cabout\u201d has \nits plain and ordinary meaning of \u201capproximately,\u201d applying t he claims to the accused device \npresents a question of technological fact as to whether the accused device meets a reasonable \nmeaning of \u201cabout\u201d in the particular circumstances).   19 (D.I. 1 53 at 6)  \n \n The crux of the dispute between the parties is whether the term should be construed to \nexclude - CF2H endgroup s.  (Id. at 7, 13, 15, 24; Tr. at 212)   While Daikin asserts that \u201c[t]he \nCourt should hold, based on the intrinsic evidence, that - CF2H is a stable endgroup\u201d ( and thus \nadopt its construction that provides that \u201cunstable endgroups\u201d do not include - CF2H), (D.I. 153 at \n30), Chemours argues that Daikin\u2019s proposal to exclude  -CF2H from the scope of the limitation is \nimproper , (id. at 13- 15).  For the reasons discussed below, the Court again agrees with \nChemours.     \n  Daikin\u2019s proposed construction is problematic for two reasons.   \nFirst, as to the part of the construction that makes reference to  a list of non- limiting \nexamples,  this does not  really  provide guidance as to what the term \u201cunstable endgroups\u201d \nactually means.  ( Id. at 10 ; id. at 12 n.2)   In its briefing, at one point Daikin  does  actually \ndescribe what the term means \u2014\u201cchemical moieties at the end of polymer chains  . . . that are not \nstable [.]\u201d  (Id. at 15)   Yet this language does not appear in its proposal.  And in its briefing, \nDaikin never explains how a list of non- limiting examples would assist the trier of fact in \nunderstanding the term\u2019s meaning.  Thus, the Court is not persuaded that the  construction for \n\u201cunstable endgroups\u201d should include this  grouping of examples.   See, e.g., Certusview Techs. \nLLC v. S & N Locating S ervs., LLC , No. 2:13cv346, 2014 WL 2090550, at *26- 27 (E.D. Va. \nMay 16, 2014) ( rejecting a proposed construction that included examples , where those examples \ndid not define the outer limits of the claim).   \n Second, Daikin\u2019s proposed negative limitation (i.e., that \u201cunstable endgroups\u201d do not \ninclude - CF2H) is not a proper use of the claim construction process .  (D.I. 153 at 13, 29- 30; Tr. \nat 175- 76)  T he specification and  the patents\u2019 prosecution history do not even mention - CF2H.  20 (D.I. 153 at 13; see also id. at  18)  However, Daikin\u2019s prior products apparently include - CF2H \nendgroups.  Chemours contends that Daikin\u2019s proposal amounts to an \u201cattempt to have this Court \nmake a factual fi nding that the - CF2H endgroups in Defendants\u2019 prior products are stable \nendgroups.\u201d   (Id. at 13 )  And t hat does seem like what Daikin is up to here.

(D.I. 153 at 8, 28- 29)   \nDaikin\u2019s briefing did not identify any shortcomings with th is portion of Chemours\u2019 \nproposed construction.  I ndeed, Daikin appear s to agree that it is in  line with the intrinsic record.  \n(See i d. at 24 )  At one point , Daikin explains  that \u201cthe term \u2018unstable endgroups\u2019 means just that, \nchemical moieties at the end of polymer chains . . . that are not stable [,]\u201d ( id. at 15), which is \nsynonymous with \u201cchemic al structures at the end of the polymer chains that react.\u201d  And Daikin \nfurther acknowledges that Chemours\u2019 proposal\u2019s characterization of \u201cunstable\u201d as \u201c\u2018unstable\u2019 in \nmelt- processing applications. . . . is consistent with the asserted patents\u2019 own definit ions[.]\u201d  ( Id. \nat 19 (emphasis, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted))    \nThus, the parties a ppear to agree that \u201cunstable endgroups ,\u201d in the context of these \npatents , can be defined as \u201cchemical structures at the end of the polymer chains that rea ct, \nusually by decomposition, under conditions at which fluoropolymers are melt -processed[.]\u201d11  \n \n 11  When pressed about the first portion of Chemours\u2019 proposal during oral argument, \nDaikin seemed to take issue with the fact that the asserted patent s only reference ther mally or \nhydrolytically unstable endgroups, and that Chemours\u2019 language could allow for endgroups to be \nthermally unstable, hydrolytically unstable, or unstable by some other metric .  (Tr. at 184- 85; see \nalso D.I. 153 at 8, 16; Daikin\u2019s Markman Presentatio n, Slide 44)  But in the absence of Daikin \nclearly pressing this argument in the briefing, and with the claims not limited to thermal 23 For these reasons, the Court recommends that the term \u201cunstable endgroups\u201d be construed in that \nmanner.    \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the District Court adopt the  \nfollowing constructions :  \n1.  \u201cmelt flow rate\u201d should b e construed to mean \u201c the amount of mass or volume of \na viscous material moving past a reference point as a function of time\u201d  \n2.  \u201cabout\u201d should be construed to mean \u201capproximately,\u201d  \u201cabout 30\u00b1 3 g/10 min\u201d \nshould be construed to mean \u201capproximately 30\u00b1 3 g/10 min\u201d and \u201cabout 30 \u00b12 g/10 min\u201d should \nbe construed to mean \u201capproximately 30\u00b1 2 g/10 min\u201d  \n3. \u201cunstable endgroups \u201d should be construed to mean \u201c chemical structures at the end \nof the polymer chains that react, usually by decomposition, under conditions at which fluoropolymers are melt -processed \u201d   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
