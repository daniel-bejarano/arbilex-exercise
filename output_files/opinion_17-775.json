Stark", "date": "02-03-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nBELCHER PHARMACEUTICALS , LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. C.A.No.17-775-LPS \nHOSPIRA , INC., \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nWHEREAS , Defendant Hospira, Inc. (\"Hospira\") moved for a determination that this \ncase is exceptional and for attorneys ' fees and related costs under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (see D.I. 258); \nWHEREAS , Hospira and Plaintiff Belcher Phannaceuticals , LLC (\"Belcher\") submitted \nbriefing and other materials regarding Hospira's fee motion (see generally D.I. 259,260,261, \n262, 268, 272); \nWHEREAS , having carefully considered the briefing and related materials, the Court \nheard argument on Hospira's fee motion by teleconference on January 18, 2022; \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Hospira's motion for attor\u00ad\nneys' fees (D.I. 258) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nThe Court's Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the conclusion of the \nhearing, excerpts of which are reproduced below.1 \n1 The Court adopts the full bench ruling. For clarity, the excerpt of the transcript contains some \nminor stylistic adjustments beyond those explicitly called out below. \n1 Let me first talk about the law. We know that the motion arises under principall y \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, which allows the Court in exceptional [patent] cases to award \nreasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party .... \nAn exceptional case is one that stands out from others with respect to the substan\u00ad\ntive strength of a party's litigating position, considering both the governing law and \nthe facts of the case or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated. [2] \nIt's the burden of the movant, here Hospira, to prove exceptionality and to do so by \na preponderance of the evidence. Ultimatel y, the determination of whether a case \nis exceptional lies within the Court's discretion, based on the totality of the circum\u00ad\nstances. And even once the Court finds that a patent case is exceptional , it still \nretains the discretion to deny an award of attorney fees. \nWith that background, let me turn to the analysis. . . . I find that this case is ex\u00ad\nceptional; and I find that based on the combination of my finding after trial that \nBelcher committed inequitable conduct, as well as the weak litigating position of \nBelcher and some of the litigation conduct undertaken by Belcher. So all three of \nthose reasons, in my view, along with the totality of the circumstances[,] here sup\u00ad\nport a finding by more than, but certainly by[,] a preponderance of the evidence , \nthat this case is exceptional. \nFirst, with respect to inequitable conduct. In this case, that finding certainly makes \nthis case stand out from all the other cases I have seen. I think I've had approxi\u00ad\nmately 30 patent bench trials. I have never once found inequitable conduct. As \nbest I could tell and recall, this is the sole instance in which I have ever found an \ninequitable conduct case proven; and so clearly it stands out and is truly exceptional \nm every way. \nWe all know in this case that finding was based on the actions and testimony of the \nplaintiff's Chief Science Officer. I' 11 refer to him as the \"CSO.\" He was also the \ncompany's Head of Intellectual Property . But he admitted that he withheld infor\u00ad\nmation from Belcher's patent attorney and from the PTO. That withheld infor\u00ad\nmation included three prior art references , some of which were but-for material to \npatentability. And he withheld that information from the PTO even though he \nknew that Belcher had disclosed some of that same information to the FDA. \nIn particular , the CSO knew about prior art that disclosed epinephrine formulations \nwith pH values that were later claimed in the '197 patent, which falsely described \nthe benefits of the claimed pH range as unexpected. \nI explained in detail in my post-trial opinion that I viewed ... the CSO's testimony \n2 Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 554 (2014). \n2 as not credible. And as we know, on appeal, the Federal Circuit unanimously af\u00ad\nfirmed the judgment of unenforceability of the '197 patent based on the finding of \ninequitable conduct. \nI know it doesn't automatically ... follow from a finding of inequitable conduct \nthat a case is exceptional and that fees should be awarded, but here it very much \ndoes follow, and it is not the only thing that makes this case exceptional. \nI also agree ... with Hospira that Belcher' s infringement case was exceptionally \nweak. The asserted claims here required a concentration of L-epinephrine of 1.0 \nto 1.06 milligrams per milliliter, but Hospira's NDA product has a concentration \nthat is quite less. \nSo Belcher was forced to concede that Hospira's NDA product does not literally \ninfringe the asserted claims. And this case has always been about the doctrine of \nequivalents. So early on in the case, Hospira moved for Rule 11 sanctions, arguing \nthat Belcher' s infringement case was frivolous because of the tremendous differ\u00ad\nence between the claimed concentration and the concentration in Hospira' s product. \nAnd although I declined at the time to award sanctions, I did also note that Hos\u00ad\npira' s arguments might be quite likely to persuade me that this case is exceptional \nfor the purposes of awarding fees under Section 285. And I made sure that Belcher \nunderstood and realized it was being warned from the get-go. \nAnd notwithstanding [the] plaintiffs efforts to try to argue otherwise today, I think \namong the things that makes this case exceptional is that, on the merits of the in\u00ad\nfringement case, it did largely end up where I was afraid[-] and where Hospira had \nwarned me [-] it might end up. That's not the sole basis for the exceptionality \nfinding, but it certainly is strong support. \nLater, during the Markman proceedings, I rejected Belcher's \"partial solution\" the\u00ad\nory under which ... the concentration limitation of 1.0 to 1.06 need only be present \nat any point during preparation of the formulation. \nI also rejected the opinion of Belcher's expert, which ... conflated improperly the \nconcepts of concentration and amount of epinephrine. \nDespite that clear ruling during expert discovery , Belcher attempted to downplay \nthe relevance of claim construction on the infringement analysis. As the case pro\u00ad\ngressed to trial ... and even after trial, Belcher never, in my view, really attempted \nto show that the concentration in Hospira's NDA product is equivalent to the \n[ claimed] concentration. Instead, Belcher seemed to merely continue to press ar\u00ad\nguments based on amounts and overages and not concentrations. \n3 Ultimately, I found in my opinion that Belcher had provided no evidence, let alone \na preponderance of the evidence, that the concentration in the defendant's product \nwas equivalent to the concentration in the claims. \nAs Hospira correctly writes in connection with the briefing on the pending motion, \n\"the Court's findings corroborated what Hospira had demonstrated before this liti\u00ad\ngation was even filed and in its earliest days: that Belcher could never establish \nthat\" the concentration in the defendant 's product is equivalent to the range that \nwas quite different, as stated in the claims. [3] \nEven Belcher acknowledges in its briefs that it lost this case lopsidedly. In my \nview, given [the] weakness of its infringement case, Belcher should not have filed \nthis lawsuit; and [it] certainly should not have proceeded with it in the manner and \nfor the length of time that it did. That is, the interest of deterrence strongly sup\u00ad\nports a finding of exceptionality and awarding of attorneys ' fees. \n. . . [T]hat concern of deterrence is only heightened by the fact that this is a case \nin the pharmaceutical drug market in which the plaintiff had an extra incentive and \nextra motivation to ... pursue what it should have understood was at best an ex\u00ad\nceptionally weak case. \nIt had an incentive to go forward nonetheless in hopes that a stay would remain in \nplace and keep the defendant's competing product off the market. \nAnd so not only does deterrence favor ... granting this motion, but it is of particular \nconcern under the totality of circumstances here. \nThere is yet a third reason why this case stands out and that the Court is finding it \nexceptional and awarding fees, and that is some ofBelcher 's litigation tactics. For \nexample, during the supplemental Markman proceedings, Belcher proposed a claim \nconstruction for the pH term that directly contradicted the construction it was pro\u00ad\nposing in parallel proceedings before another District Court. \nI don't think that the analogy to ... a personal-injury or other types of cases where \na plaintiff argues theories in the alternative ... really works here. \nThe issue in front of me at that time really was focused on whether the pH limitation \nrefers to an intermediate product or only to a final product. And that presented a \nclaim construction question, essentially a question of law: what would a person of \nordinary skill in the art reading this claim think ... the limitation applied to? And \nI don't see how a patentee applying that same standard in two different cases could \nsay in one instance it applies to the intermediate product, but in another instance it \n3 D.I. 259 at 10. \n4 applies to the final product. I think that was not an appropriate manner [ of] pro\u00ad\nceeding in this Court at that time in this case. \nMoreover, before trial, Belcher stipulated that certain products were prior art. But \nafter trial, Belcher attempted to escape from its stipulations without offering any \ngood reason why it should be permitted to do so .... \n[T]he inequitable conduct [is] far and away the most important [ of the three rea\u00ad\nsons] ... this case stand[s] out ... but [the other reasons are] also the extraordinary \nweakness ofBelcher 's infringement case and that they were on notice of that weak\u00ad\nness from very early on in the case, as well as the unreasonable litigation tactics \nI've noted. For all those reasons, Hospira has more than met its burden of proving \nby a preponderance of the evidence that this case is exceptional. \nI've considered ... all of Belcher's arguments against awarding fees. They're all \nunavailing . Let me touch on a few. \nBelcher emphasizes that it prevailed on several motions throughout the case, in\u00ad\ncluding the motion for sanctions and a motion for partial summary judgment of \nnoninfringement. That does not really help Belcher very much. A defendant or \na prevailing party doesn't need to win every ... motion, every step, every day in \norder to be the prevailing party and to prove that a case is exceptional. \nAnd although I denied the sanctions motion, it was a pretty serious motion, and it \nled to the warnings that I've already talked about. There was nothing frivolous \nabout that sanctions motion. \nThe summary judgment decision was not an assessment of the evidence. It came \nbefore claim construction and ... largely, if not entirely, before discovery , and it \nhad to do with legal issues. \nToday, Belcher ... suggests that this case is really just about one bad witness or \nmaybe two bad witnesses performing badly at trial and poorly drafted claims. I \nthink, as is clear from the totality of the circumstances from the record, from my \ndetailed opinion, and from my remarks today, that's not what this case is. If it \nreally were just about a witness testifying poorly at trial or poorly drafted claims, \nthe plaintiff would be right, those things happen in many patent cases. But this \ncase is about much more than that. I've already explained what makes it excep\u00ad\ntional. \n... [A]s must be clear, I disagree with Belcher's suggestion that no deterrence is \nnecessary. For the reasons I've said, I think deterrence is quite important here. \nAnd the fact that Belcher evidently has no further association with its former CSO \ndoes not contradict my finding. \n5 Belcher and other companies and other litigants should be deterred from allowing \ntheir officers to participate in fraudulentl y obtaining intellectual property rights and \nfrom pursuing costly litigation when they have obtained rights by inequitable con\u00ad\nduct and have, at best, a weak infringement case. \nAccordingly, I will exercise my discretion and award Hospira attorney fees for this \ncase. \n. . . I'm denying two portions of the fees requested by Hospira. \nAnd I should say, I am viewing this case inclusively and as a whole, as the law, I \nunderstand, requires me to do. But nonetheless , for reasons I'll explain, there's \ntwo parts of the defendant 's request that I'm not granting. \nFirst, I'm not awarding the defense its expert fees. That request is directed not to \n\u00a7 285, but to my inherent authority to award sanctions. I recognize such sanctions \nmay be appropriate when there's a finding of fraud or bad faith. And encompassed \nwithin the finding of inequitable conduct is a finding of fraud with respect to the \nPatent Office. But I do not believe, nonetheless , under the totality of circum\u00ad\nstances, it would be appropriate to require Belcher to reimburse Hospira for its ex\u00ad\npert fees. \nThere has been no finding, not even any allegation ... of fraud on the Court. It's \nnot as if the plaintiff brought in an expert to waste time at trial and try to deceive \nthe Court by ... lying to the Court. I recognize my inherent authority is probably \nbroad enough that I could award what the defendant is asking for here, but I just \ndon't find that it is warranted under the totality of circumstances. \nAnd my decision is the same with respect to the defendant 's request to be awarded \nits fees incurred in connection with the plaintiff's appeal to the Federal Circuit. \nThat is, I'm denying the request for recovery of the fees incurred in connection with \nthat appeal. \nAs an initial matter, the appeal itself was not exceptional. Plaintiff was well within \nits rights to appeal and actually narrowed that appeal to only challenging the ineq\u00ad\nuitable conduct finding. There was nothing frivolous or vexatious or even unrea\u00ad\nsonable about those decisions by the plaintiff. \nNow, I recognize I don't need to find the appeal itself to be independently excep\u00ad\ntional in order to give the defendant what it's asking for, but I think it is noteworthy \nthat the appeal was in no way exceptional. \nAnd, in fact, my thought is that because this finding of inequitable conduct was so \n6 extraordinary and so exceptional and, again for me, was the only time I have ever \nfound it, and a finding of inequitable conduct no doubt could have consequences \nfor people's reputations , for companies ' reputations and could adversely affect ca\u00ad\nreers, and these findings are rare, I think it was entirely understandable and reason\u00ad\nable for Belcher to ask a higher court to carefully review my finding of inequitable \nconduct. \nAnother way of putting that is, when I think about deterrence , I don't think that it \nfavors granting the fees for the appeal. This was not an appeal that I would want \nto have deterred. \nFinally, let me talk just briefly about the reasonableness of the fee request. Belcher \nchallenges the reasonableness of Hospira's requested fees. In particular , Belcher \nargues that the rates charged by Hospira's lead counsel in New York surpass rates \ncharged by Delaware attorneys. The Federal Circuit has explicitly approved an \naward of attorney fees under Section 285 at the rates the attorneys actually \ncharge.[4] \nAnd I think everybod y agrees it's within my discretion to award the fees based on \nthe rates that were actually charged by the lawyers who actually litigated. \nAnd here there is reason to do so. Hospira's counsel has a long relationship rep\u00ad\nresenting Hospira in numerous jurisdictions across the country and extensive expe\u00ad\nrience litigating patent disputes like this one. It was a very logical choice [for] \nHospira to stick with the lead counsel that it had used before in matters like this. \nFurther, in my view, the relevant market here is the market for national counsel that \npractices patent litigation in the District of Delaware. For that market, all the evi\u00ad\ndence that I have seen is that the fees charged by [the] defendant's national counsel \nare entirely reasonable. \n[Belcher points out] that there are plenty of Delaware lawyers who are fully capable \nof litigating cases like this as lead counsel, [ and] I agree entirely. There are a lot \nof ... outstanding Delaware lawyers who can and do litigate cases like this, includ\u00ad\ning as lead counsel, and nothing in my decision should suggest that I think other\u00ad\nwise. \nBut that doesn't mean that Hospira has to choose only Delaware counsel as its lead \ntrial counsel; or, more pertinently , it doesn't mean that there was anything unrea\u00ad\nsonable about the fees that Hospira incurred in defending itself in this litigation . \n4 E.g., SRI Int'!, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 930 F.3d 1295, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2019). \n7 In that regard, I would also note there's a lot of back and forth in the briefing about, \nwell, the plaintiff only spent X number of millions of dollars and the defendant \nspent more ... millions of dollars; that, too, does not make anything that the de\u00ad\nfendant did unreasonable. \nAnd I agree with the defendant that they had more at stake in this case. The plain\u00ad\ntiff was asserting a patent that does not expire until the year 2034. And had Hos\u00ad\npira lost this case, it would have been off the market with its drug product for all \nthe time until 2034. By contrast, all that Belcher had at stake was a patent that it \n. . . had received after prosecuting the patent application in a manner that was \nmarred by inequitable conduct, a patent that it never should have obtained. \nI agree with the following statement from Hospira: \"The hours expended by Hos\u00ad\npira's attorneys were reasonably necessary to defend against an infringement case \nthat never should have been brought, on a patent that never should have issued.\"[5] \nI further agree with Hospira that it has met its obligation under Rule 54(d)(2)(B)(3) \nto state the amount sought or to provide a fair estimate of the requested fees. \nSo, for all those reasons, I am granting in part and denying in part the defendant 's \nmotion. I will ultimately enter an order that will require Belcher to reimburse Hos\u00ad\npira for every dollar that Hospira reasonably expended on counsel litigating this \ncase to trial in this Court. And that will include fees incurred on motions and mat\u00ad\nters on which Hospira did not prevail. That is, for example, a motion for sanctions, \nwhich the defendant lost, but was all a part of the overall litigation , which was \nlitigated in a reasonable manner by the defendant. \n. . . I am excluding only the expert fees and the attorney fees incurred solely in \nconnection with Belcher' s appeal. \nFebruary 3, 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware \n5 D.I. 272 at 7. \n8 HONO LE LEONARD P.
