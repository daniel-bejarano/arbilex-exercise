Chapter 11 \nBanla. Case No. 20-12522-JTD \n(Jointly Administered) \nAdv. No. 20-50850-JTD \nMisc. No. 21-374-LPS \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nHaving reviewed the motion filed by Securities Opt-Out Plaintiffs (\"Appellants \")1 for \nleave to appeal on an expedited basis (D.I. 1) (\"Motion\") the Banlauptcy Court's Order Granting \nthe Debtors' Motion to Extend Injunctive Relief Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 (Adv. D.I. 253)2 \n(\"Extension Order\") entered on August 30, 2021; and having reviewed the opposition (D.I. 2) \nfiled by Mallinckrodt plc and certain affiliates (\"Debtors\"), along with the parties' supplemental \nletters (D.I. 3, 4), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is DENIED. \n1. Appellants have not met their burden to show that leave to appeal the \ninterlocutory Extension Order is warranted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).3 Under that standard, an \n1 Appellants are plaintiffs in an action against Debtors and certain of their directors and officers \n(\"D&O Defendants \"), Healthcor Offshore Master Fund, L.P. v. Mallinckrodt pie, et al., No. \n1 :20-cv-02834 (D.D.C.) (\"Healthcor Action\"). The Healthcor Action complaint asserts that, \nbetween 2015 and 2017, defendants Mallinckrodt plc (\"plc\"), Mark Trudeau (the Debtors' Chief \nExecutive Officer), and Matthew Harbaugh (Debtors' former Chief Financial Officer) made false \nand misleading statements relating to Acthar, allegedly artificially inflating plc's stock price. \n2 The docket of the adversary proceeding , captioned Mallinckrodt pie v. State of Connecticut , et \nal., Adv. No. 20-50850-JTD (Banla. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Adv. D.I. _.\" \n3Section 158(a) does not identify the standard district courts should use in deciding whether to \ngrant an interlocutory appeal. \"Typically, however, district courts follow the standards set forth interlocutory appeal is permitted only when the order at issue (1) involves a controlling question \nof law upon which there is (2) substantial ground for difference of opinion as to its correctness , \nand (3) if appealed immediatel y, may materially advance the ultimate termination of the \nlitigation . See Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, 754 (3d Cir. 1974). \n2. In their effort to justify an interlocutory appeal, Appellants identify a single \nallegedly controlling question of law: \"whether the Bankruptcy Court was legally required to \ndetermine whether there were 'unusual circumstances ' or an 'identity of interest' to extend the \nautomatic stay to the nondebtor defendants in [Healthcor] .\" (D.I. 1 at 9) But the legal holding \nthat Appellants now attempt to challenge was first decided in November 2020 in connection with \nthe initial injunctive order dated December 4, 2020. (Adv. D.I. 170) (\"Injunction\") Seeking a \nstay of litigation against the D&O Defendants , Debtors asserted that a disjunctive test applied \nunder governing law, which looked either to unusual circumstances created through an identity \nof interest or to the existence of adverse impacts that would threaten the Debtors' reorganization. \n(See Adv. D.I. 23 at 12-13) Appellants did not object to the Debtors' motion for injunctive relief \nor any position taken therein. The Bankruptc y Court agreed with the Debtors, holding: \"Courts \nhave extended the stay in two circumstances: One, where the debtor shows unusual \ncircumstances , such that there is an identity of interest between the third-party defendant and the \ndebtor; and two, where extending the stay is essential to the debtors' reorganization efforts.\" \n(D.I. 2 Ex A (Nov. 23, 2020 Hr'g Tr.) at 48-50 (citing McCartney v. Integra National Bank \nNorth, 106 F.3d 506, 510 (3d Cir. 1997)) Applying this test, the Bankruptcy Court entered the \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), which govern interlocutory appeals from a district court to a court of \nappeals.\" In re AE Liquidation , Inc., 451 B.R. 343,346 (D. Del. 2011); see also In re \nPhiladelphia Newspapers, LLC, 418 B.R. 548, 556 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (\"Based upon the decision of \nthe Third Circuit in Bertoli v. D'Avella (In re Bertoli), 812 F.2d 136, 139 (3d Cir. 1987), courts \nwithin this Circuit confronted with the decision whether to grant leave to allow an interlocutory \nappeal are informed by the criteria in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).\"). \n2 Injunction based on its determinations that: (1) Debtors were not required to demonstrate unusual \ncircumstances through an identity of interests to justify an injunction when they can instead \ndemonstrate adverse impacts on the Debtors' ability to reorganize (id. at 48-50); and (2) having \nnonetheless applied the unusual circumstances inquiry, \"the existence of contractual \nindemnification claims is sufficient to meet the unusual circumstances test\" (id. at 50).4 \n3. Here, in considering whether to extend the Injunction for an additional 90 days, \nand in keeping with its prior ruling, the Bankruptc y Court relied upon cases establishing that \n\"adverse impacts\" on the estate are sufficient on their own to justify a third-party injunction. \n(See Aug. 26, 2021 Hr'g Tr. at 26 (quoting A.H Robins Co. v. Piccinin, 788 F.2d 994, 1003 (4th \nCir. 1986) (\"Pursuant to [Section 105] the Court may issue or extend stays to enjoin a variety of \nproceedings [including discovery against the debtor or its officers and employees] which will \nhave an adverse impact on the Debtor's ability to formulate a Chapter 11 plan\")) (emphasis \nadded); id. at 27 (quoting In re WR. Grace & Co., 115 F. App'x 565, 570 (3d Cir. 2004) (\"The \nstandard for the grant of a stay is generally whether the litigation could interfere with the \nreorganization of the debtor, or would interfere with, deplete or adversely affect property of \n[the] estate or which would frustrate the statutory scheme of chapter 11 or diminish [the \ndebtor's] ability to formulate a plan of reorganization\")) (internal quotations omitted; emphasis \nadded). Applying these standards , the Bankruptcy Court determined that allowing any of the \nsubject actions against the non-debtors to proceed at this time \"would certainly have an impact, \nand adverse impact on the debtors' reorganization especially at this critical time.\" (Id. at 26) As \n4 Appellants did not to participate in the initial injunction proceedings, did not contest any of \nthese conclusions, and were not entitled to appeal them. Although another plaintiff group did \nseek leave to appeal, this Court concluded the Injunction was not a final order and interlocutory \nappeal was not warranted. See Mem. Order, Mallinckrodt pie v. Connecticut, Misc. No. 20-408-\nLPS (D. Del. Feb. 12, 2021). \n3 to Appellants specifically , the Bankruptc y Court stated if \"the [Healthcor Action] [were] allowed \nto proceed against the Debtors' current and former officers, [the Debtors] would certainly face \nthe need to protect their interests\" against the risks of \"collateral estoppel and record taint.\" (Id. \nat 26) The Court further found that \"the continuing stay will prevent distraction and potential \ndiminution in estate assets including available insurance by having to appear and defend [ officers \nand employees] plus adversely affecting the debtors' reorganization efforts.\" (Id. at 28) Based \non these findings, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Extension Order. \n4. In seeking leave to appeal the Extension Order, Appellants now challenge the \nBankruptcy Court's holding-first decided in November 2020-that \"adverse impacts\" on the \nestate are sufficient on their own to justify a third-party injunction. The Court disagrees that the \nappeal presents an issue of controlling law. The alleged error would not be reversible because, \n\"a reviewing court may affirm the lower court's decision on any basis,\" and \"an appellee may, \nwithout taking a cross-appeal , support the judgment as entered through any matter appearing in \nthe record.\" EF Operating Corp. v. Am. Bldgs., 993 F.2d 1046, 1048 (3d Cir. 1993). Here, the \nrecord reflects that the Bankruptcy Court has already performed the requested \"unusual \ncircumstances\" analysis. For instance, in the November 2020 Bench Ruling, the Bankruptcy \nCourt held as a matter of law that \"the existence of contractual indemnification claims is \nsufficient to meet the unusual circumstances test.\" (Nov. 23, 2020 Hr'g Tr. at 50)5 Later, in the \nNovember 2020 Bench Ruling, the Bankruptc y Court held that proceedings \"creating significant \nrisk of collateral estoppel and record taint to the point where the debtors would need to \nparticipate in those actions to protect their interests\" also satisfy the unusual circumstances test. \n5 While Appellants now argue, for the first time, that such indemnification is insufficient \nbecause Trudeau and Harbaugh are \"independentl y liable\" and the indemnification may not be \n\"absolute\" (D.I. 1 at 12), this argument is unavailing for the reasons set forth in the Debtors' \nopposition (see D.I. 2 at 19 n.6). \n4 (Nov. 23, 2020 Hr'g Tr. at 50) \n5. Even assuming an issue of controlling law existed, there is no substantial ground \nfor difference of opinion on this point: the Third Circuit's holding in McCartney clearly states a \ndisjunctive test; that is, a third-party injunction may be justified by either (a) \"unusual \ncircumstances\" creating an identity of interest, or (b) a need to protect the reorganization. 106 \nF.3d at 510. The August 2021 Bench Ruling cites additional authority supporting McCartney in \nholding that an \"unusual circumstances \" analysis is not required where, instead, adverse impacts \non the reorganization are shown.6 The cases cited by Appellants (see D.I. 1 at 10-11) do not \nsupport the proposition that the unusual circumstances test must be met. (See D.I. 2 at 17-18). \n6. The Court further agrees with Debtors that the Motion has other deficiencies, \nincluding waiver of the issue on appeal 7 and failure to identify exceptional circumstances . 8 \nNovember IO, 2021 H~LELE~k \nWilmington, Delaware UNITED STA TES DISTRICT JUDGE \n6 See A.H Robins Co. v. Piccinin, 788 F.2d 994, 1003 (4th Cir. 1986); In re WR. Grace & Co., \n115 F. App'x 565 (3d Cir. 2004). \n7 While they challenge the ruling that adverse impacts on the estate are sufficient to justify a \nthird-party injunction, Appellants also relied upon it. Appellants quoted the Bankruptcy Court's \nNovember 2020 holding verbatim as the governing legal standard in objecting to the Extension \nOrder. (Adv. D.I. 239 at 6) Having not raised the issue below at any time-having in fact relied \nupon the holding they now challenge-Appellants cannot seek to raise the issue for the first time \non appeal.

United States, 182 F.3d 212,219 (3d Cir. 1999) (stating \n\"well-established rule that absent compelling circumstances an appellate court will not consider \nissues that are raised for the first time on appeal\"). \n8 \"[C]ertification of an interlocutory appeal is granted sparingly and only in exceptional \ncircumstances. \" Kaiser Grp.
