MENTINO DISILVESTRO,  et al.,  : \n: \nDefendant s.   : \nAnt\nonio Hughes, Austell, Georgia.   Pro Se Plaintiff.  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAp\nril 7, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware1 ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \nPlaintiff  Antonio Hughes, a former pretrial detainee at James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware, since released, filed this action pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  (D.I. 3).  The Amended Complaint is the operative pleading.  (D.I. \n12).  Plaintiff  appears pro se and was g ranted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.   (D.I. \n5).  He paid the filing fee following his release from JTVCC .  The Court proceeds to \nscreen the Amended Comp laint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(a).  \nBACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint and assumed to be \ntrue for screening purposes.  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 F.3d 59, 64 \n(3d Cir. 2008).   On April 30, 2017 , at 3:40 a.m., Plaintiff, his spouse, and their \nunresponsive son arrived at Kent General Hospital.   (D.I. 12, \u00b6 1) .  Kent General \nHospital contacted authorities and Defendants Cpl. Hurd and Cpl. Hopkins of the Dover Police Department , along with Defendant Delaware State Police detective Robert \nDaddio responded and made contact with Plaintiff and his spouse.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4).  \nPlaintiff and his spouse were unwilling to cooperat e with the officers  while in the \npresence of Defendants Kent Hospital constable Kahn  and Bayhealth officer Timothy \nPreuss.  ( Id. at \u00b6 4).  Daddio contacted Defendants Delaware State Police detectives \nJennifer Buzzuro and Mentino DiSilvestro and informed them of a suspected child abuse case.  ( Id. at \u00b6 5).  DiSilvestro provided the information to Defendant Delaware \nState Police detective Thomas Ford.  ( Id. at \u00b6 6).   \nDefendant Dr. Mark Harris pronounced the child dead at 3:54 a.m . and instructed \nhis nurse to ask the parents to come back to the Emergency Department Family Room.   /s/ Richard G. Andrews2 \n (Id. at \u00b6 7 , 8).  They refused,  and the Dover Police Department was informed that the \nparents were uncooperative and attempting to leave the hospital.  ( Id. at \u00b6 9).  Plaintiff \nalleges that Dr. Harris conspired with the officers to bring the parents to the Family \nRoom because Dr. Harris realized that he could not  do so  through his own power .  (Id. \nat \u00b6 10).  \nWhen Plaintiff attempted to leave, Kent General Hospital offi cers physical ly \napprehended him and his spouse and escorted them to the Family Room.  ( Id. at \u00b6 11).  \nBuzzuro arrived and Hurd and Hopkins told Buzzuro t hat the parents were being held in \nthe Family Room.  ( Id. at \u00b6 12).   Once Dr. Harris informed the parents their child had \ndied, he immediately  left.  (Id. at \u00b6 13).  The parents , who were not Mirandized,  were \nquestioned in the presence of Buzzuro, DiSilvestro, Ford, and Defendant Delaware State Police detective N. Miller .  (Id. at \u00b6 14) .  DiSilvestro asked  Ford to bring the \nparents to Delaware State Police Troop 3 for additional questioning by Miller  because \nthe death was being considered as a homicide.  ( Id. at \u00b6 15).   After he was questioned, \nPlaintiff was handcuffed and taken to Troop 3 by Defendant Delaw are State Police  \ntrooper Adkins , Ford, Buzzuro, and/or N. Miller.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 16-17). \nPlaintiff was detained in a  cell block for hours and then taken to an interrogation \nroom for further questioning.  ( Id. at \u00b6 21).   After Plaintiff\u2019s post -Miranda statements \nconclu ded, Defendant Delaware State Police supervisor Gerald Windish informed \nPlaintiff that he would be processed and charged with a breach of condition of a bond, \nand not a charge relating to the death investigation.  ( Id. at \u00b6 22).   A bond hearing was \nheld on April 30, 2017.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26).  Also, on April 30,  2017, a criminal complaint \nwas filed and it was approved by Windish on May 2, 2017.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27).  3 \n On May 1, 2017, Plaintiff was charged with a probation/parole violation and an \nadministrative warrant issued for his arrest.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24).   During a May 2, 2017 \nbail review hearing,  Defendant Delaware Deputy Attorney General Stephen E. Smith \nstated to the Court that if Plaintiff had obeyed the Court\u2019s order and stayed away from \nthe family, his son would be alive  ( Id. at \u00b6 26).  The Court asked if Plaintiff had been \ncharged with homicide  and Smith indicated that charges w ere forthcoming.  ( Id.).  \nDuring hearings on June 12, 2017 and August 15, 2017, Smith was asked ab out \ncriminal charges for the death of Plaintiff\u2019s son and again informed  the Court that the re \nwould be charges.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6  28, 29).  On June 12, 2017, Plaintiff was sentenced to two \nand one- half years  on the probation/parole violation, and on August 15, 2017, he was \ngiven an additional sixty days  for the violation following Smith\u2019s discussion with the \nCourt and his showing the Court a photo of the deceased child .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2 9-32).  \nBetween May 10, 2018 and October 15, 2018, numerous reports were filed \nconcerning the death of Plaintiff\u2019s son which  indicated the case remained  pending-\nactive .  (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  33-38).  On January 24, 2019, the Office of the Delaware Attorney \nGeneral and the Delaware Division of Family Services commenced a civil action against \nPlaintiff  and filed a \u201cPetition for S ubstantiation on the C hild Protection Registry. \u201d  (Id. at \n\u00b6 39).   On June 6, 2019 Plaintiff was charged with murder by abuse or neglect in the \nfirst degree, and on June 19, 2019, the Office of  the Attorney General moved to stay the \ncivil proceedings.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  44, 45).   On May 28, 2019, Chanel Green, the mother of \nthe deceased child, was charged with endangering the welfare of a child and criminally \nnegligent homicide.  ( Id. at \u00b6 43).  On June 23, 2019, she pled guilty to endangering the 4 \n welfare of a child and prosecutors dropped the criminally negligent hom icide charge.   \n(Id. at \u00b6 46).  \n On April 29, 2020, while awaiting trial on the murder charge, Plaintiff received \ndiscovery.  He  alleges it was at this point  that he  realized his arrest was illegal  and that \nDr. Harris had conspired with officers to physically apprehend and take him somewhere \nknowingly against his will.  ( Id. at \u00b6 50).  Plaintiff also discovered that Daddio withheld \nhis April 30, 2017 incident repor t and that the State withheld Hurd\u2019s and Hopkins\u2019 \nincident reports from the discovery altogether.  ( Id. at \u00b6 51) .  Plaintiff alleges the incident \nreports of Daddio, Hurd, and Hopkins were \u201ccoincidentally and conveniently completely \nvoid of the date  of April 30, 2017 in Plaintiff\u2019s discovery which added to the delay in \nPlaintiff filing this complaint.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 52) .  The reports were handed over the day of \ntrial and provided the actions of Hurd and Hopkins , identified Adalberto Aviles  (an officer \nwith the Dover Police Department ) and indicated that actions were taken to satisfy Dr. \nHarris\u2019 request to move Plaintif f and his spouse to a secure location.  ( Id.).  During the \ntrial, Green testified that she w as the one who had injured the child.  ( Id. at \u00b6 55).  On \nJuly 20, 2021 Plaintiff was found not guilty on the charges and all the lesser included \ncharges.  ( Id. at \u00b6  55).  \n Plaintiff alleges that:  (1) Dr. Harris conspired with Kohn to seize, transport, and \nillegally detain him  in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; (2) \nKohn, P reuss, Daddio, Hurd, and Hopkins illegally detained/arrested Plainti ff in violation \nof the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Delaware law; ( 3) while in \ncustody he was interrogated without procedural safeguards ( i.e., Miranda) by Buzzuro, \nDiSilvestro, Ford, and Miller ; (4) DiSilvestro cons pired with Dr. Ford to further the illegal 5 \n detention /arrest  by transporting Plaintiff to  police headquarters despite knowing of \nPlaintiff\u2019s desire not to cooperate in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution; (5) Adkins, Ford, Buzzuro, and/or Miller handcuffed, patted down, \nsearched, and transported Plaintiff to police headquarters  despite knowing of Plaintiff\u2019s \ndesire not to cooperate in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \n(6) Miller placed Plaintiff in a holding cell for hours leaving him barefoot and cold in \nviolation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment s to the U.S. Constitution; (7) \nsupervisor Windish fai led to take actions to curb the action of the foregoing defendants \nin violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment s to the U.S. Constitution;  (8) \nMiller did not officially record the action of April 30, 2017 as an arrest, Daddio \ncompletely withheld his April 30, 2017 incident report , and the State withheld Hurd and \nHopkins incident  reports  in whole, all to hide t he officers\u2019  actions in in violation of the \nFifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;  and (9) Smith violated Plaintiff rights o n \nnumerous occasions when Smith accused Plaintiff of committing a crime without \nproperly filing an  accusatory instrument , waited two years to charge Plaintiff , and \nanother two years to give Plaintiff his day  in court  in violation of  the Fifth and Sixth \nAmendment s to the U.S. Constitution.  (D.I. 12 at 23 - 27).  \nPlaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief  as well as  compensatory and \npunitive damages.   (Id. at 23 -28).   \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary 6 \n relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant) .  The C ourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a pro se  plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007).  Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his  \nAmended Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent \nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at \n94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or  futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . 7 \n  A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane \nConst r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,787 (3d Cir. 2016).  Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \nStatute of Limitations .  Plaintiff complains of act s that took place on April  30, \n2017,  following the death of his child, through January 24, 2019.\n1  He filed his \nComplaint on February 21, 2021 as determined by the  prisoner mailbox rule.  See \n \n1 Claims filed by Plaintiff that occurred on or after February 21, 2019 are timely filed.   8 \n Houston v. Lack , 487 U .S. 266 (1988); Burns v. Morton , 134 F.3d 109, 112 (3d Cir. \n1998); Gibbs v. Decker , 234 F. Supp. 2d 458, 463 (D. Del. 2002) .    \nFor purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions.  Wilson v. Garcia , 471 U .S. 261, 275 (1985).  In Delaware,  \n\u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two- year limitations period.  See  10 Del. Code \u00a7  8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F.  Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).  Section 1983 claims accrue \n\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is \nbased. \u201d  Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).  \nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly rai sed.  See Benak ex rel. Alliance \nPremier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P.,  435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon,  807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201c Although \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,  sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen \u2018the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual \nrecord is required to be developed. \u2019\u201d  Davis v. Gauby , 408 F. App\u2019 x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010)  (quoting Fogle v. Pierson , 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)).  Hence,  a court \nmay dismiss a time -barred complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \nPlaintiff  complains of act s on April 30, 2017 through January 24, 2019.  Knowing  \nthat the Complaint was not timely filed,  Plaintiff alleges that it was not until he received \ndiscovery from his criminal case on April 29,  2020, that he realized his arrest was illegal, \nthat Dr. Harris conspired with officers to physically apprehend and take Plaintiff \nsomewhere against his will (on April 30, 2017) , that Daddio withheld his incident report \nfor the entire day of April 30, 2017, that the State of Delaware (a non -defendant) 9 \n withheld Hurd\u2019s and Hopkins\u2019 incident reports from discovery  until the start of Plaintiff\u2019s \ncriminal trial and their reports were \u201cvoid\u201d of the April 30, 2017 date.  Plaint iff alleges this \nadded to the delay in Plaintiff filing this complaint.  (D.I. 12 at 21).   Under Delaware\u2019s \n\u201ctime of discovery rule,\u201d the statute of limitations is tolled when the plaintiff has suffered \nan inherently unknowable injury of which the plaintiff is blamelessly ignorant.  See \nDickens v. Coupe , 2018 WL 366730 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 10, 2018) .  \nAlthough Plaintiff alleges that it was not until he received discovery in his criminal \ncase  that harm occurred, it is evident from the allegations that he should have known of \nthe alleged harm given that he was a participant in almost every event of which he \ncomplains.   In other words, he was not \u201cblamelessly ignorant\u201d of the events  except  \nthose  claims regarding the incident reports that either did not contain the April 30, 2017 \ndate or were withheld until the start of the criminal trial.  These claims , however,  do not \nrise to the level of constitutional violations  and/or were allegedly performe d by a non-\ndefendant.  \nIn addition, t he Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations provide no basis for the Court \nto toll the two- year limitation period. Under federal law, equitable tolling is appropriate in \nthree general scenarios:  (1) where a defendant actively mi sleads a plaintiff with respect \nto his cause of action; (2) where the plaintiff has been prevented from asserting his claim as a result of other extraordinary circumstances; or (3) where the plaintiff asserts his claims in a timely manner but has done so i n the wrong forum.  Lake v. Arnold, 232 \nF.3d 360, 370 n.9 (3d Cir. 2000).   None of these exist.   \nPlaintiff\u2019s claims  for actions from April 30, 2017 through January 24, 2019,  are \nbarred by the applicable two year limitation period inasmuch as the C omplaint was not 10 \n filed until February 21, 2021, past the two- year limitation for these  claims .  It is evident \nfrom the face of the Complaint that  these are barred by the two year limitations period.   \nTherefore, the claims from April 30, 2017 through January 24, 2019 will be dismiss ed.  \nAmendment is futile as to these claims.  \n Conspiracy .  Plaintiff alleges that on April 30, 2017, Dr. Harris conspired with \nKohn and DiSilvestro to seize, detain, arrest, and transport Plaintiff in violation of the \nFourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   Even were the claim s not time -barred,  they \nare not cognizable.  \nTo state a conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1983, Plaintiff must show that \u201cpersons \nacting under color of state law conspired to deprive him of a federally protected right.\u201d  \nGannaway v. Berks Cty. Prison , 439 F. App\u2019x 86, 93 (3d Cir. 2011).  \u201c[T]he linchpin for \nconspiracy is agreement.\u201d  Id . (quoting Bailey v. Board of Cty. Cmm\u2019rs , 956 F.2d 1112, \n1122 (11th Cir. 1992).  There are no facts show ing that Defendants had an agreement, \nimplicit or otherwise, to deprive Plaintiff of his federal rights.  The claim is frivolous and will be dismissed.  \n Respondeat Superior .  Plaintiff alleges that Windish , as a supervisor,  failed to \ntake actions to curb the action of the foregoing defendants in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment s to the U.S. Constitution.   Even were the claims not time-\nbarred, they are not cognizable.  As is well known, t here is no respondeat superior \nliability under \u00a7 1983.  See Parkell v. Danberg , 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016).   \n A defendant in a civil rights action is not responsible for a constitutional violation \nin which he did not participate or which he did not approve.  Baraka v. McGreevey , 481 \nF.3d 187, 210 (3d Cir. 2007); see also Polk County v. Dodson , 454 U.S. 312, 325 11 \n (1981).  Such involvement may be \u201cshown through allegations of personal direction or of \nactual knowledge and acquiescence.\u201d Evancho v. Fisher , 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. \n2005).   The claims against Windish f ail as a matter of law and will be dismissed.  \n Prosecutorial Immunity .  Plaintiff alleges that Smith violated  his rights on \nseveral occasions when Smith accused Plaintiff of committing a crime without properly \nfiling an accusatory instrument, waiting two y ears to charge Plaintiff, and another two \nyears to give Plaintiff his day  in court in  violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to \nthe U.S. Constitution.  (D.I. 12 at 23 - 27).  All the claims against Smith occurred during \ncriminal proceedings against Plaintiff, i.e., the revocation of bond charge, the violation of \nprobation/parole charge, or the criminal charge brought against Plaintiff in relation to the \ndeath of his child.  \nProsecutors should not be encumbered by the threat of civil liability while \nperforming judicial or quasi -judicial functions.  See Odd v. Malone, 538 F.3d 202, 208 \n(3d Cir. 2008).  Prosecutors acting within the scope of their duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution are immune to suit under \u00a7  1983.  Imbler v. Pachtman , \n424 U.S. 409, 410 (1976).  The  acts of which P laintiff complains  fit squarely within the \nrealm of official prosecutorial duties.  See id . at 430  (activities intimately associated with \nthe judicial phase of the criminal process, casting the prosecutor as an advocate rather than an administrative or investigative officer, trigger absolute immunity).  Smith,  \ntherefore, enjoy s immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability for those acts  and the claims against him \nwill be dismissed.  \nReleased Inmate.  After Plaintiff advised the Court that he had been released \nfrom JTVCC, the Court entered an order  on October 19, 2021 for Plaintiff  to either file a 12 \n long form application to proceed without prepayment of fees and affidavit so that the \ncourt could  determine whether he was still eligible to proceed without prepayment of the \n$350.00 filing fee or to pay the balance of the filing fee owed ( i.e., $179.60).  (D.I. 8).  \nPlaintiff sought and  received an extension of time until on or before December 20, 2021 \nto comply with the order.  (D.I. 9, 10).  \nPlaintiff remitted payment to the Clerk of Court.   However, on February 2, 2022,  \ntwo money orders were returned to Plaintiff  by the Clerk\u2019s Office without  action. The \nmoney orders are in the amount of $179.00 and $1.00.   (See D.I. 15).  The Clerk\u2019s \nOffice was unable to process both checks because they were both endorsed by  Plaintiff  \nand because Plaintiff remitted an overage (i.e., $180.00) .  The correct amount owed is \n$179.60.   Plaintiff was told to remit a new check or money order in th e amount  pf \n$179.60  so that the payment could be properly processed.   To date plaintiff has not \ncomplied with the October 19, 2021 order.  He will be given additional time to do so.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Amended Complaint  pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).   While the Court finds amendment \nfutile  as to the constitutional or other violations that occurred before February 21, 2019, \nit is possible that Plaintiff could allege some constitutional or other violations occurring after that date.  Thus, leave to file an amended complaint is granted so long as the violations are alleged to occur after February 21, 2019.   Also, Plaintiff will be given \nadditional time to comply with the Court\u2019s October 19, 2021  \n An ap propr iate O rder will be entered.  1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nANTONIO HUGHES ,   : \n: \nPlaintiff,    : \n: \nv.     : Civil Action No. 21 -251-RGA  \n: \nSGT. MENTINO DISILVESTRO, et al.,  : \n: \nDefendants.    : \nORDER \nA\nt Wilmington this 7th day of  April, 202 2, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \nIT IS ORDERED that:  \n1.
