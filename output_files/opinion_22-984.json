Shifrin, \nBAKER & HOSTETLER LLP, New York, New York. \nCounsel for Defendant \nMarch 7, 2023 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM ORDER -GREGORYB . WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Defendant 's Motion (D.I. 11). \n1. Plaintiff Open Text, Inc. (\"Plaintiff' or \"Open Text\") filed this action against \nDefendant IPBoutique , Inc. (\"Defendant \" or \"IPB\") to obtain monetary compensation based on \nIPB's alleged breach of contract. IPB now moves to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint (the \n\"Complaint \") for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, under Rule l 2(b )( 6) and, \nin the alternative, moves for summary judgment under Rule 12(d) (the \"Motion\"). D.I. 11; D.I. \n12 at 1. \n2. Plaintiff and IPB entered into a written agreement (\"Agreement \") in August 2020, \nwhich consists of a service order (\"Service Order\") that incorporates by reference Open Text's \nGeneral Terms and Conditions (\"GTC\") and Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\"). D.I. 1 ,r 1. \n3. The Service Order included an Initial Term of sixty months and a Minimum \nCommitment of $160,000.00 per year. D.I. 1 ,r 14, Ex. 1 at 1. IPB agreed to meet the Minimum \nCommitment for each year of the Initial Term. D.I. 1 ,r 15, Ex. 1 \u00a7 3. Under the GTC, IPB's \nobligation to pay fees specified in the Service Order, including the Minimum Commitment , \nsurvived termination of the Agreement. D.I. 1 ,r 16, Ex. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 8.3, 9. \n4. Under the Service Order, IPB had access to Plaintiffs proprietary software \nrelating to email notifications to third parties and IPB used this software to allow their customers \nto distribute marketing emails. D.I. 1 ,r 2. In or around April 2021, Plaintiff learned that IPB \nwas utilizing Plaintiffs software to distribute mass spam emails, in violation of the Agreement. \nD.I. 1 ,r 3. Plaintiff notified IPB of the violation and sought to remedy the violation. D.I. 1 ,r,r 3, \n1 4, 22. Plaintiff learned that IPB was engaged in conduct designed to avoid compliance with the \nterms and the conditions of the Agreement and, more specifically , the AUP, as well as avoid \ndetection of non-compliance. D.I. 1 ,r,r 4, 20-22, 24. In September 2021, Plaintiff terminated the \nService Order and invoiced IPB for balance of the Minimum Commitment. D.I. 1 ,r,r 5, 25. IPB \nhas failed to pay this invoice. D.I. 1 ,r 5. \n5. Open Text is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Menlo \nPark, California that provides \"Enterprise Information Management software products which \nenable businesses to grow, while lowering operational costs and reducing information \ngovernance and security risks by improving business insight, impact, and process speed.\" D.I. 1 \n6. IPB is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Brooklyn, \nNew York. D.I. I ,r 8. IPB is a technolog y service provider that \"provide[s] customers with \nassistance handling leases, purchases , and sales of IPv4.\" Id. \n7. Plaintiff filed their Complaint on July 27, 2022. D .I. I. IPB filed a Stipulation \nand Proposed Order to Extend Time to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the Complaint to \nOctober 26, 2022. D.I. 8. This Court entered the Order on September 19, 2022. On October 26, \n2022, IPB filed this Motion. \n8. To state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short \nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief ... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). Such a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, \n342 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) (citing Bell At!. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads \n2 factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.\"' Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowicz LLP, 991 F.3d 458, \n462 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). The Court disregards '\"legal conclusions \nand recitals of the elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclusory statements. '\" \nPrinceton Univ., 30 F.4th at 342 (quoting Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. \n2016)). The court may consider matters of public record and documents \"integral to or explicitly \nrelied upon in\" the complaint. Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241,249 (3d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up); \nsee also Nekrilov v. City of Jersey City, 45 F.4th 662, 675 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022) (similar). \n9. At the motion to dismiss stage, \"'[t]he issue is not whether a plaintiff will \nultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' \nIn re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. Liab. Litig., 804 F.3d 633,638 (3d Cir. 2015) \n(citation omitted). \"'A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) may be granted only if, \naccepting all well pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light \nmost favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' Havens v. Mobex Network Servs., \nLLC, 820 F.3d 80, 87 n.12 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d \n1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997)). \n10. For the reasons below, the Court finds that Plaintiff adequately alleges breach of \ncontract claim. \n11. In this case, Plaintiff asserts a claim for breach of contract and seeks damages of \n$634,476 plus interests and costs. D.I. I 135. Plaintiffs basis for their claim is that, following \nthe termination of the Agreement , IPB failed to pay the mandatory Minimum Commitment fine. \nD.I. 1 134. Additionally , Plaintiff asserts that (1) Plaintiff did notify IPB of their violations and \n3 (2) IPB was not entitled to notice and an opportunity for cure for the specific violations under the \nAgreement. See D.I. 1 ,r,r 22, 26. \n12. Defendant filed the Motion, arguing that Plaintiff does not have a valid claim \nbecause Plaintiff themselves failed to abide by the notice and cure provision in the Agreement, \nand thus Plaintiff does not have a claim upon which they can recover. D.I. 12 at 1-2. IPB cites \nto the following language in the Service Order: \"[ e ]ither party may terminate this Service Order \nat any time in the event that the other party breaches any provisions of this Service Order in any \nmaterial respect and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written \nnotice of such breach.\" D.I. 12 at 3 (emphasis added). In essence, IPB's argument is one of \ninadequate notice. IPB also attaches extraneous materials to their Opening Brief as evidence of \nimproper notice under the Agreement. See D.I. 12 at 6-11; D.I. 13; D.I. 14. \n13. However, \"[i]n evaluating a motion to dismiss, the Court should not consider \nextraneous materials, but should only consider the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached \nto the complaint, and matters of public record.\" Acosta v. De Vilbiss Landscape Architects , Inc., \nNo. CV 17-354 (MN), 2018 WL 5033757, at *2 (D. Del. Oct. 17, 2018) (citing Schmidt, 770 \nF.3d at 249). Therefore, the Court will not consider the supplementary exhibits and \ncorrespondence provided by IPB in making its determination. \n14. \"The Court concludes that the adequacy of notice cannot be resolved under the \nstandard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\" Rupert v. Range Res. -Appalachia , LLC, No. CV 21-1281, \n2022 WL 1689510, at *8 (W.D. Pa. May 26, 2022). See also Brusamonti v. XI'O Energy Inc., \nNo. CV 20-652, 2021 WL 2209120 (W.D. Pa. June 1, 2021) (notice is a question for summary \njudgment); Optical Air Data Sys., LLC v. L-3 Commc 'ns Corp., No. Nl 7C-05-619 EMD CCLD, \n4 2019 WL 328429, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 23, 2019) (finding question of fact as to whether \nparty could cure default under terms of agreement). \n15. Turning to IPB's alternative motion for relief under summary judgment , \"[i]f, on \na motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not \nexcluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there \nis no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"A genuine issue of material fact is one that could lead a reasonable \njury to find in favor of the nonmoving party.\" Bletz v. Corrie, 974 F.3d 306, 308 (3d Cir. 2020) \n( citation omitted). \"The court must review the record as a whole, draw all reasonable inferences \nin favor of the nonmoving party, and must not 'weigh the evidence or make credibility \ndeterminations.\"' Id. (citation omitted). The Court must enter summary judgment if the non\u00ad\nmoving party \"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element \nessential to [its] case, and on which [the non-moving] party will bear the burden of proof at \ntrial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); see also SodexoMAGIC, LLC v. \nDrexel Univ., 24 F.4th 183,204 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322). \n16. IPB requests the Court to consider documents beyond the Complaint. It is \ngenerally not the practice of this Court to decide case dispositive motions without agreement \nbetween the parties and without prior approval from this Court. See form Scheduling Order of \nJudge Williams -Non-Patent (Bench Trial) at ,r 6 (\"Absent agreement between the parties, and \nprior approval from the Court, the Court will not hear case dispositive motions in cases \nproceeding to a bench trial.\"). Here, there is no agreement and no prior approval. A jury trial \nhas not been demanded. See D.I. 1. \n5 17. Furthermore, this Court reviewed the briefing for this Motion and agrees with \nPlaintiff that there are genuine issues of material facts regarding whether proper notice under the \nAgreement was (1) required, and (2) provided by Plaintiff, as well as if there would be futility of \nnotice. D.I. 16 at 17-21. For these reasons, this Court will deny IPB's alternative motion for \nrelief under summary judgment as premature. \nTherefore, at Wilmington thi~\u00b0t\\ay of March, 2023, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \nDefendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim and, In the Alternative, Motion for \nSummary Judgment (D.I. 11) (the \"Motion\") is DENIED . IT IS ALSO HEREBY ORDERED \nthat, not later than thirty (30) days from the date of this Memorandum Order, the parties shall \nmeet and confer and file a joint proposed Scheduling Order in this action consistent with the \napplicable form Scheduling Order of Judge Williams, which 1s posted at \nhttp://www/ded/uscourts.gov (See Chambers , Judge Williams, Forms), along with a cover letter \nrequesting the Court to enter the joint proposed Scheduling Order (if there are no disputes or \nother issues concerning scheduling that the Court needs to address) or to schedule the Scheduling \nConference. If there are disputes or other issues the Court needs to address in the joint proposed \nScheduling Order, in the cover letter, the parties shall direct the Court to the paragraph numbers \nin the joint proposed Scheduling Order which those appear. \n6 "}
