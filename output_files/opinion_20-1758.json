No. 20-1758-GBW\nNEW CASTLE COUNTY PD, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nMichael A. Rivera, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro\nSe Plaintiff.\n\nDaniel A. Griffith, Whiteford Taylor Preston LLC, Wilmington, Delaware.\nCounsel for Defendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nMarch 28 , 2023\nWilmington, Delaware\nZee ne.\n\nWILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:\nIL INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Michael A. Rivera, an inmate confined at the James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center Institution filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (D.I.\n2, 8). He appears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n(D.I. 6). Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6). (D.I. 33). The matter is fully briefed. Plaintiff has also requested\nappointed counsel. (D.I. 40).\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Complaint was docketed on December 23, 2020. (D.I. 2). In the\nComplaint,! Plaintiff named as Defendants the New Castle County Police\nDepartment (\u201cNCCPD\u201d) and several John Doe Defendant NCCPD police officers.\n(Id.). Plaintiff asserted constitutional claims under \u00a7 1983 for illegal search and\nseizure and excessive force following a December 26, 2018 traffic stop during\nwhich Plaintiff and the passenger in his car were arrested. (D.I. 2, 8). Plaintiff was\ncharged with several drug and traffic offenses, but the charges were later nolle\nprossed. (D.I. 8). For relief, Plaintiff requested damages, and declaratory relief.\n\n(D.I. 2 at 4).\n\n' Plaintiff filed an addendum to the Complaint. (D.I. 8). References herein to \u201cthe\n\nComplaint,\u201d refer to both the Complaint and the addendum.\n1\nOn August 16, 2021, the Court screened the Complaint and supplement\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(a). (D.I. 9). The Court dismissed\nthe claims against the NCCPD, identified what appeared to be cognizable and non-\nfrivolous Fourth Amendment and excessive force claims against the Doe\nDefendants, and entered a service order upon the NCCPD for the sole purpose of\nidentifying the Doe Defendants. (D.I. 9, 10).\n\nOn November 12, 2021, the NCCPD filed a notice identifying the Doe\nDefendants as Corporal Andrew Rosaio (\u201cRosaio\u201d), Officer Joseph Mihalyi\n(\u201cMihalyi\u201d), Master Corporal Silvio Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d), Sergeant Bradley Landis\n(\u201cLandis\u201d) and Officer Kenneth Guarino (\u201cGuarino\u201d). (D.I. 15). By Order issued\non December 28, 2021, the caption of the Complaint was amended, and Plaintiff\nwas directed to return U.S. Marshal-285 forms for each Defendant so that the\nUnited States Marshal could serve them. (D.I. 17). On March 3, 2022, counsel for\nDefendants entered an appearance. (D.I. 21). Defendants now move to dismiss the\nComplaint as time-barred and for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 33, 34). Plaintiff\nopposes dismissal. (D.I. 35).\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the\n\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the\n\nlight most favorable to Plaintiff. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).\n2\nBecause Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94.\n\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to\nthe complainant, a court concludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim\nof entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).\n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more\nthan simply provide \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action.\u2019\u201d Davis v. Abington Mem\u2019l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,\n241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). The Court is \u201cnot required\nto credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.\u201d\nInre Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002). A\ncomplaint may not be dismissed, however, \u201cfor imperfect statement of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted.\u201d Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11\n(2014).\n\nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has\n\u201csubstantive plausibility.\u201d Jd. at 12. That plausibility must be found on the face of\nthe complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial\n\nplausibility when the [complainant] pleads factual content that allows the court to\n\n3\ndraw the reasonable inference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct\nalleged.\u201d Jd. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task\nthat requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common\nsense.\u201d Id. at 679.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs claims are time-barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations. For purposes of the statute of limitations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims are\ncharacterized as personal injury actions. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275\n(1985). In Delaware, \u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two-year limitations period.\nSee 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8119; Johnson v. Cullen, 925 F. Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).\nAccordingly, that statute of limitations of Plaintiff's claims ran until December 26,\n2020. His Complaint was timely as it was docketed on December 23, 2020.\nDefendants, however, were not named therein; John Doe Defendants were named.\n\n\u201cThe naming of a John Doe defendant in a complaint does not stop the\nstatute of limitations from running or toll the limitations period as to that\ndefendant.\u201d Garvin v. City of Philadelphia, 354 F.3d 215, 220 (3d Cir. 2003)\n(citing Talbert v. Kelly, 799 F.2d 62, 66 n.1 (3d Cir. 1986)). Accordingly, the\nclaims against Defendants are time-barred unless Plaintiff can meet the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c), which allows amendments\u2014in this case the\n\namendment of the case caption to replace the Doe Defendants with the named\n\n4\nDefendants\u2014to \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing date of the original complaint. See\nSingletary v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corr., 266 F.3d 186, 200-01 (3d Cir. 2001);\nNelson v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 60 F.3d 1010, 1014-15 & n.6 (3d Cir. 1995); see also\nGarvin, 354 F.3d at 220 (\u201cReplacing the name John Doe with a party\u2019s real name\namounts to the changing of a party or the naming of a party under Rule 15(c), and\nthus the amended complaint will relate back only if the three conditions specified\nin that rule are satisfied.\u201d).\n\nUnder Rule 15(c)(1)(C), an amendment that changes the party or the naming\nof the party in an action relates back to the original pleading only if a plaintiff can\nshow: (1) the claim set forth in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,\ntransaction, or occurrence in the original pleading; (2) within 90 days of the filing\nof the complaint, the parties to be brought in by amendment received notice of the\ninstitution of the suit and would not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense; and (3)\nthe new parties knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning their\nidentities, they would have been made parties to the action. See Garvin, 354 F.3d\nat 222.7 Because this rule is conjunctive, Plaintiff must prove each of the three\n\nfactors. Singletary, 266 F.3d at 194\n\n2 Prior to a 2015 amendment to Fed. R. 4(m), parties to be brought in by\namendment had 120 days to receive notice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 advisory\ncommittee\u2019s notes (2015 amendment).\n\n5\nDefendants appear to concede, as they must, that the claims set forth in the\namended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence in the\noriginal pleading, given that the claims are wholly unaltered. Defendants,\nhowever, argue they did not receive notice of the suit within 90 days of filing and\nthat Plaintiff cannot establish a mistake as to their identities that caused him to\nname them as John Does, because their identities were known to him before he\nfiled the Complaint.\n\nThe Court concludes that Defendant did in fact have the requisite notice\nwithin 90 days of the filing of the Complaint. Where a plaintiff proceeds pro se\nand in forma pauperis, the 90-day period does not begin until the Court has\ncompleted its review and screening pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and\n1915A(a). See Urrutia v. Harrisburg Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, 91 F.3d 451, 453-54 Gd\nCir. 1996). Here, that process was not completed until the December 28, 2021\nOrder amending the caption and directing service on Defendants. Given that\nDefendant\u2019s counsel made his initial appearance on March 3, 2022, Defendant had\nnotice within 90 days.\n\nIn support of their argument that Plaintiff cannot claim mistaken identity\nbecause he knew Defendants\u2019 identities prior to filing suit, Defendants ask the\nCourt to take judicial notice of four documents. Those documents are as follows.\n\nFirst, a complaint Plaintiff filed with NCCPD on December 27, 2018, the day after\n\n6\nhis arrest, in which he identified Defendants Mihalyi, Martin, and an unknown\nindividual as participating in his arrest (\u201cCitizen Complaint\u201d). (D.I. 33-2 at 2).\nPlaintiff referenced the Citizen Complaint in his Complaint in this action. (D.I. 2\nat 3). Next are two Exoneration Letters from NCCPD, which found no\nwrongdoing on the part of Mihalyi, Martin, and Rosaio (identified in an\nExoneration Letter as the unknown participant referenced in the Citizen\nComplaint) (D.I. 33-3 at 2; D.I. 33-4 at 2). The Exoneration letters were undated,\nbut Plaintiff clearly received them before filing his Complaint in this action, as\nevidenced by the fact that he referenced them in the Complaint. (D.I. 2 at 3).\nFinally, Plaintiff provides the transcript from the preliminary hearing in Plaintiffs\nstate court criminal proceedings, during which Mihalyi identified Defendants\nLandis and Guarino as the officers who arrested Plaintiff's passenger. (D.I. 33-5 at\n16).\n\nThe Court takes judicial notice of the above-referenced documents. See\nSands v. McCormick, 502 F.3d 263, 268 (3d Cir. 2007) (concluding that judicial\nnotice of the transcript of a preliminary hearing was proper because it was a public\ndocument and had a bearing on the controversy); Buck v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist.,\n\n452 F.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201cIn evaluating a motion to dismiss, [courts] may\n\n3 In the Citizen Complaint, Plaintiff misspelled Mihalyi\u2019s name as \u201cMahalley.\u201d\n(D.I. 33-2 at 2).\n7\nconsider documents that are attached to or submitted with the complaint, . . . and\nany \u2018matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items subject to\njudicial notice, matters of public record, orders, [and] items appearing in the record\nof the case.\u2019\u201d) (quoting 5B Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1357 (3d ed. 2004)).\n\nThe Court concludes, based on the Citizen Complaint, Exoneration Letters,\nand preliminary hearing transcript, that Plaintiff indisputably knew the identities of\nDefendants when he filed the Complaint and, therefore, the amendment inserting\nthem in place of the John Does did not relate back to the Complaint, thus rendering\nthe claims against these Defendants untimely under the applicable two-year statute\nof limitations. See Garvin, 354 F.3d at 221-22 (\u201cOf course, an amended complaint\nwill not relate back if the plaintiff had been aware of the identity of the newly\nnamed parties when she filed her original complaint and simply chose not to sue\nthem at that time.\u201d). Accordingly, dismissal is mandatory.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss (D.I. 33); (2) deny Plaintiff's request for appointed counsel (D.I. 40) as\nmoot; and (3) direct the Clerk of Court to close the case.\n\nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nMICHAEL A. RIVERA,\nPlaintiff,\nV. Civ. No. 20-1758-GBW\nNEW CASTLE COUNTY PD, et al.,\nDefendants. :\nORDER\nAt Wilmington, sh@? tice of March, 2023, consistent with the\nMemorandum Opinion issued this date,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\nLis Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 33) is GRANTED.\n2: Plaintiff's request for appointed counsel (D.I. 40) is DENIED as\nmoot.\n\n3. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE this case.\n\n, 1 f HINO\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n"}
