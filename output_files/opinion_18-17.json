Stark", "date": "12-29-2021", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv. > Crim. No. 18-17-LPS\nCrim. No. 10-102-LPS\nTIMOTHY KEYES,\nDefendant.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 29th day of December, 2021, having reviewed Defendant\u2019s Motion\nto Stay Execution of Sentence (D.I. 113)! (\u201cMotion\u201d), as well as the related filings (see D.I. 113-\n1, 116, 117),\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. Defendant\u2019s Motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to renew. Based on\nthe filings to date, the Court is not persuaded that Defendant has met his burden for obtaining a\nstay pending appellate review. See generally 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b)(1). In particular, the Court\nagrees with the government that Defendant has not shown that his pending appeal \u201craises a\nsubstantial question of law or fact likely to result in . . . reversal, . . . an order for a new trial, ...\na sentence that does not include a term of imprisonment, or . . . a reduced sentence to a term of\nimprisonment less than the total time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal\n\nprocess.\u201d Id? Nevertheless, for reasons including Defendant\u2019s evolving health situation and the\n\n! All references to the docket index (D.I.) are to Criminal Action No. 18-17.\n2 As the government writes:\n\nHere, the defendant\u2019s asserted \u2018substantial questions\u2019 are \u2018issues\n\n1\nfact that the Court is modifying his reporting date, the Court is willing to consider a renewed\nmotion if it timely filed after the status teleconference ordered by the instant order.\n\n2. The record indicates that Defendant was only recently released from the hospital.\n(See, e.g., D.I. 117) The Court further understands, from the record and from contact with the\nUnited States Probation Office, that he is scheduled for follow-up treatment in February.\n\n3. Defendant is currently scheduled to begin the remainder of the term of\nincarceration to which he has been sentenced on January 3, 2022. The government\u2019s position is\nthat \u201cto the extent that the defendant\u2019s medical conditions prevent him from reporting on January\n3,\u201d \u201cthe government does not oppose\u201d the Court \u201cchangl[ing] the self-reporting date.\u201d (D.I. 116\nat 1)\n\n4. The Court understands that the Defendant will be designated to a Federal Medical\nCenter, The Court continues to believe that the Bureau of Prisons will be able to treat\nDefendant\u2019s medical conditions, even recognizing their seriousness. Nevertheless, given the\ngovernment\u2019s lack of opposition, Defendant\u2019s recent hospitalization, and the upcoming follow-\n\nup treatment, the Court will exercise its discretion to modify Defendant\u2019s self-reporting date.\n\nwith respect to his motion to withdraw/] his guilty plea\u2019 and\nwhether his sentence was \u2018excessive.\u2019 These are not substantial\nquestions. The Court already considered the defendant\u2019s\narguments about withdrawing his plea and found them to lack\nmerit.\n\n[Additionally,] the defendant was sentenced to 42 months\nincarceration by the Court. That sentence represented a significant\nvariance from the sentencing guidelines range of 70-87 months,\nparticularly given that the guidelines for an accompanying\nviolation of supervised release constituted an additional 24-30\nmonths of possibly consecutive time.\n\n(D.L. 116 at 4, 3)\nAccordingly, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant shall self-report on\nWednesday, March 2, 2022.\n\nFinally, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:\n\nA. The parties shall meet and confer and the government, on behalf of both parties,\nshall file a joint status report on February 9, 2022. In the report, the parties shall update the\nCourt on Defendant\u2019s health situation and whether the parties anticipate any further motion\npractice in this matter.\n\nB. The Court will hold a status teleconference with the parties on February 11, 2022\n\nat 8:45 a.m. The government shall make the arrangements for the call.\n\nHONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n"}
