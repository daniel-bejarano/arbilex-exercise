No. 20- 53-RGA  \n     \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \nPlaintiff Scott Franklin, Jr., ( \u201cFranklin\u201d ) brought this derivative action on behalf of Sealed \nAir Corporation (\u201cSealed Air \u201d) against several current and former directors  (collectively , \n\u201cDefendants \u201d).  Defendants moved to dismiss,  and nominal defendant Sealed Air joined the \nmotion.  (D.I. 23, 25.)  I held a hearing on the motion on May 17 , 2022.  ( \u201cTr. __.\u201d)  For the reasons  \nannounced from the bench on May 18, 2022, I recommend that Defendants \u2019 motion be \nGRANTED.   \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 2 \n 12(b)(6)  for failure to state a claim.  \u201c To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018 state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell A tl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201c factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged. \u201d  Id.  A possibi lity of relief is not enough.  Id.   \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \n\u2018merely consistent with \u2019 a defendant \u2019s liability, it \u2018stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief. \u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557).   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint, I must assume all \u201c well-pleaded facts \u201d are \ntrue but need not assume the truth of legal conclusions.  Id.  at 679.  \u201c [W]hen the allegations in a \ncomplaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entit lement to relief, this basic deficiency \nshould be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d   Twombly , 550 U.S. at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nMy Report and Recommendation was announc ed from the bench on May 18, 2022, as \nfollows:  \nThis is my Report and Recommendation on Defendants \u2019 \nMotion to Dismiss.\n1   \n \nI will summarize the reasons for my recommendation in a \nmoment.  Before I do, I want to be clear that my failure to address a \nparticular argument advanced by a party does not mean that I did not consider it. We have carefully considered the operative \ncomplaint, the parties \u2019 briefs and exhibits, and the arguments made \nat yesterday \u2019s hearing.\n2  We will not be issuing a separate report, but \nwe will issue a written document incorporating what I am about to \nsay and a statement of the applicable legal standard.  \n \n1 (D.I. 23.)  \n \n2 (D.I. 1  (\u201cCompl.\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, 27, 30; Tr .) 3 \n  \nFor the following reasons, Defendants \u2019 motion should be \ngranted . \n Sealed Air Corporatio n sells packaging materials such as \nBubble Wrap.  Scott Franklin, Jr., owns Sealed Air stock.\n3  He \nbrought this suit on behalf of Sealed Air, alleging that a number of current and former directors breached their fiduciary duties under state law and made m isrepresentations and omissions in violation of \nfederal securities laws.\n4   \n Franklin says that, in 2014, Sealed Air took an improper tax \ndeduction and employed a flawed process to select an independent auditor.  In 2014, Sealed Air recorded a loss of $1.49 billion to settle liabilities from the use of asbestos by its predecessor.\n5  The company \ncarried back the loss ten years.  In connection with that loss, it \nclaimed a $247 million tax refund and a $175 million deferred tax \nasset.  The refund and offs et were disclosed in a February 2015 press \nrelease and in the company \u2019s 2014 10- K.6   \n Sealed Air \u2019s independent auditor, KPMG, audited the 2014 \n10-K and did not flag the tax treatment as improper.\n7  In November  \n2014, the company announced that, following a \u201ccompetitive search \nprocess ,\u201d its Audit Committee had voted to replace KPMG with \nErnst & Young for fiscal year 2015.8  According to Franklin, the \nsearch process was not \u201c competitive \u201d because it was rigged: Sealed \nAir\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer, William G. Stiehl, had colluded \nwith Ernst & Young to help it get selected.9   \n Later, in 2015, Sealed Air disclosed that the IRS indicated \nthat it intended to disallow the tax deduction but that the company \nthought it had a meritorious argument and intended to fight for its \n \n3 (Compl. \u00b6 \u00b6 2, 29, 97.)    \n4 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72\u201382, 214\u201357.)  \n \n5 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 98, 102.)    \n \n6 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 103, 107\u201308. ) \n \n7 (See id. \u00b6\u00b6 107\u201308.)    \n \n8 (Id. \u00b6 106.)    \n \n9 (Id. \u00b6 165; s ee also D.I.  24, Ex. 17 \u00b6\u00b6 14\u201347.)  4 \n deduction.10  Franklin thinks that the tax deduction was improper \nand was somehow related to the company\u2019 s decision to replace its \nlongtime auditor, KPMG, with Ernst & Young in 2015, but \nFranklin\u2019 s complaint is light on facts connecting the t wo.    \n \nIn any event, Franklin contends that the director D efendants \nknew about both improprieties and concealed them for years.  \nDuring that time, some of the same director Defendants caused Sealed Air to buy back some of its stock.\n11  Because the company \u2019s \nstock price at the time did not reflect the concealed wrongdoing, Franklin says, the company overpaid for its own stock.  In count two of his complaint, Franklin contends that the director D efendants \u2019 \nconduct violated \u00a7  10(b) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits \nmaking material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with a securities trade.\n12   \n In count one of his complaint, Franklin contends that \nDefendants violated \u00a7 14(a) of the Exchange Act. Section  14(a) \nmakes it unlawful for anyone to solicit proxies in contravention of \nSEC rules , and SEC Rule 14a -9 prohibits solicitations containing \nmaterial misrepresentations or omissions.\n13  Franklin says that \nSealed Air \u2019s 2017 and 2018 proxy statements violated \u00a7 14(a) \nbecause they failed to mention the improprieties with respect to the tax deduction and selection of Ernst & Young, that those improprieties caused the company\u2019 s financial statements to be \nincorrect, that the company \u201c failed to maintain internal controls, \u201d \nand that some of the Defendant directors had violated the company\u2019 s \nCode of Conduct.\n14  In count three, Franklin seeks to hold the \ndirector Defendants also responsible under \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange \nAct, which makes control persons jointly and severally liable for Exchange Act violations.\n15  The rest of Franklin\u2019 s claims are under \nstate law.    \n  \n \n10 (Compl. \u00b6 121.)   \n \n11 (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 167 \u201384.)   \n \n12 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b- 5. \n \n13 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a) ; 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a -9(a).   \n \n14 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 218\u201319.)  \n \n15 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t.   5 \n Franklin did not demand the board bring an action before \nfiling this derivative suit himself.  D efendants moved to dismiss the \nentire case.  They argue that Franklin failed to demonstrate demand \nwas excused and that his complaint fails to state a clai m.16   \n \nI agree with Defendants that Franklin fails to state a federal \nclaim.  The federal claims should therefore be dismissed , and the \nCourt should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the state law \nclaims.   \n \nI start with the \u00a7 10(b) claim in count two.  Section 10(b) \nbans deception.17  Franklin says the director D efendants violated \n\u00a7 10(b) by deceiving Sealed Air into overpayi ng to buy back its own \nstock.  But the complaint alleges that those buybacks were controlled by the same director D efendants.\n18   \n While it might be possible for one or more directors to \nviolate \u00a7 10(b) by misleading the company\u2019 s shareholders or by \ntricking other directors into taking action,\n19 it is not possible for a \ndirector to deceive himself.  Franklin \u2019s pleaded theory \u2014that the \ndefendant directors spread misleading information and then the same directors relied on and were deceived by that false infor mation \nwhen they approved stock buy backs \u2014is factually impossible and \ncannot lead to any relief under \u00a7 10(b) .\n20  I recommend that the claim \nunder \u00a7 10(b) be dismissed. \n  \n \n16 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 23.1.   \n \n17 To state a claim for  securities fraud  under \u00a7 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b- 5, the complaint \nmust plead \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation or omission, (2) scienter, (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission, (5) economic loss, and (6) loss causation.\u201d City of Edinburgh Council v. Pfizer, Inc., 754 F.3d 159, 167 (3d Cir. 2014). \n \n18 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 167 \u201384, 226, 229.)  \n \n19 Plaintiff cited a line of cases  in which some courts permitted derivative claims under \n\u00a7 10(b) under circumstances where a company\u2019s directors engaged in deceptive self-dealing .  See, \ne.g., In re Whitehall Jewellers, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, No. 05- 1050, 2006 WL \n468012, at *11\u201312 (N.D. Ill. 2006).   T here are no such allegations here.   \n \n20 Elfers ex. rel. AbbVie, Inc. v. Gonzalez , No. 20- 213, 2020 WL 7264272, at *2\u20133 (D. Del. \nDec. 10, 2020) (Bibas, J.);  cf. Kates ex. rel. MetLife, Inc. v. Kandarian, No. 19- 1266, 2020 WL \n4287374, at *8 n.6 (D. Del. July 27, 2020), adopted, 2020 WL 12432745 (Sept. 8, 2020).   6 \n The complaint separately alleges in count one that the \ndirector Defendants are liable for misleading their shareholders: \naccording to Franklin, [the directors]  made false or misleading \nproxy statements in 2017 and 2018 that led the shareholders to \nreelect the directors, approve the executive compensation program, \nand ratify the company\u2019 s retention of Ernst & Young as auditor.  \nFranklin says that violated \u00a7 14(a) of the Exchange Act.    \n  A \u00a7 14(a) claim requires  that \u201c(1) a proxy statement \ncontained a materi al misrepresentation or omission which (2) caused \nthe plaintiff injury and (3) that the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction. \u201d . . . .\n21     \n  Section 14(a) claims (as well as \u00a7 10(b) claims) are subject \nto certain heightened pleading requirements in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act [ (PSLRA )].  Among other things, the PSLRA \nrequires the complaint to \u201c specify each statement alleged to have \nbeen misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading. \u201d\n22  The Court must dismiss a complaint that fails to \nsatisfy those requirements .23   \n As an initial matter, Franklin \u2019s complaint arguably does not \ncomply with the PSLRA because it does not specify a particular statement in the 2017 or 2018 proxy statement and explain why it \u2019s \nmisleading.  Count two alleges that the challenged proxy statements \u201cmade references to the Code of Conduct \u201d but it doesn\u2019 t specify any \nparticular statements that were misleading.  \n In his briefing and at oral argument, Franklin pointed to two \nportions of  the 2017 and 2018 proxy statements that, he says, are \nmisleading because they omit material facts.  First, each of the proxy \n \n21 Jaroslawicz  v. M&T Bank Corp., 962 F.3d 701, 710 ( 3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Tracinda \nCorp. v. DaimlerChrysler AG , 502 F.3d 212, 228 (3d Cir. 2007)).  \n22 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(1); Hysong v. Encore Energy Partners LP , No. 11- 781, 2011 WL \n5509100, at *6 (D. Del. Nov. 10, 2011)  (\u201c[I]n order to plead facts to sufficiently allege . . . a section \n14(a) claim, a plaintiff must identify a precise statement in the proxy that is either affirmatively misleading in and of itself, or is rendered misleading by operation of a materially omitted fact. \u201d); \nsee also Heinze v. Tesco Corp ., 971 F.3d 475, 480 (5th Cir. 2020) ( \u201cEven for omission- based \nclaims, the plaintiff must identify specific \u2018 statements [in the proxy statement] \u2019 that are rendered \n\u2018false or misleading \u2019 by the allege d omissions.\u201d ).   \n23 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u- 4(b)(3)(A).   7 \n statements mentions that the company has a code of conduct and \nthat it is posted on the company website.  Although his briefing is  \nhardly a model of clarity, Franklin appears to suggest that the references to the code of conduct are misleading because the proxy statements omit that some people had violated the code.\n24     \n  \nSecond, the 2017 and 2018 proxy statements say the board \nhad retained Ernst & Young as independent auditor for  those fiscal  \nyears and they requested the shareholders to ratify the choice.  Franklin says that the statements were misleading because they did \nnot mention that, years earlier, Ernst & Young had been sele cted \nthrough a flawed process for the alleged purpose of continuing to \nargue for the company\u2019 s improper tax deduction, which resulted in \nthe company misstating its cash flow.\n25   \n  \nI\u2019m not sure there is anything misleading about the first \nstatement, but ev en if there is it is clearly immaterial.  I do not take \nFranklin to seriously contend that a reasonable shareholder would assume there were no ethics violations just because the company had a code of ethics.  While it is possible that shareholders would ha ve \nremoved some members of the board sooner had they known of their alleged misdeeds, it would not be because either proxy statement mentioned a code of ethics.\n26   \n Equally problematic is that Franklin has not pleaded facts \nshowing how either statement was the \u201c essential link \u201d in any \ndamage to the corporation.  Franklin points to three effects of the proxy solicitations : the reelection of the directors, the confirmati on \nof the compensation plan, and the ratification of the retention of Ernst & Young as auditor.  In Franklin\u2019 s theory they are \ninterconnected.  Supposedly the directors were only reelected because Ernst & Young helped the company continue to \u201c conceal \u201d \nthe impending loss of the claimed tax deduction for two more years (even though the company had previously disclosed the deduction and the IRS \u2019s intent to disallow it), and Ernst & Young was only \nretained because the directors were reelected.  I am highly skep tical \nthat Franklin has pleaded facts that plausibly support those factual \n \n24 (Compl . \u00b6\u00b6 135, 152, 219; Tr . 32:20\u201333:7.)  \n \n25 (Compl . \u00b6\u00b6 136, 153, 218; Tr. 33:17\u201334:6, 38:20\u201339:18.)  \n \n26 See UA Loc. 13 Pension Fund v. Sealed Air Corp., No. 19- 10161, 2021 WL 2209921, at \n*3\u20135, *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2021)  (dismissing \u00a7 10(b) c laims against Sealed Air and Defendant  \nStiehl based on statements about code of ethics).  \n 8 \n inferences.   But e ven if I accepted Franklin \u2019s theory, in the Third \nCircuit merely reelecting board members and paying them is not an \n\u201cessential link \u201d to financial loss from any mi smanagement they \ncommit.27 \n  Nor has Franklin adequately explained how the \nshareholders \u2019 ratification of the company\u2019 s 2017 and 2018 retention \nof Ernst & Young was an \u201c essential link \u201d in any damage to the \ncorporation.  Indeed, Franklin has not even suggest ed that \nshareholder ratification was \u201c essential \u201d to the company \u2019s retention \nof Ernst & Young for those years.  I am unaware of any law or any provision in Sealed Air \u2019s charter that required the shareholders to \nratify the board \u2019s choice of auditor, and Franklin did not cite any.\n28  \nAbsent pleaded facts suggesting that the shareholder \u2019s ratification \nof Ernst & Young was an \u201cessential link \u201d in a transaction that caused \nharm to the company, Franklin can\u2019 t make out a \u00a7 14(a) claim based \non it.29 \n  For all of those reasons, I recommend that the claim under \n\u00a7 14(a) be dismissed.  \n Count three is the \u00a7 20(a) claim.  Liability under \u00a7 20(a) \nrequires an underlying violation of a federal securities law or rule.\n30  \nBecause the complaint fails to state a predicate Exchange Act violation, it also fails to state a claim under \u00a7 20(a).  Accordingly, I recommend that Plaintiff \u2019s claim under \u00a7 20(a) be dismissed. \n  \nThe remaining claims are based solely on Delaware law.  \nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3), this Court may decline to exercise \nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims if it dismisses all \nthe claims over which it has original jurisdiction.   \u201c It \u2018must  decline \u2019 \nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction in such circumstances \u2018 unless \n \n27 Gen.

CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated  above,  Defendants\u2019 m otion to dismiss should be  GRANTED.   \nThis Report  and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B),  (C), \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(1), and District of Delaware Local Rule 72.1.
