{"case_name": "Dodd v. City of Milford", "case_number": "20-1761", "judge": "Judge Leonard P. Stark", "date": "03-31-2022", "ocr_text": "BRANDON DODD, \nV. \nCITY OF MILFORD , IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPlaintiff, \nC.A. No. 20-1761-LPS-CJB \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nWHEREAS , Magistrate Judge Burke issued a Report and Recommendation (the \n\"Report\") (D.I. 20) on February 22, 2022, recommending that the Court deny Defendant City of \nMilford's (\"Defendant \" or the \"City\") motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) (D.I. 5); \nWHEREAS , on March 8, Defendant objected to the Report (\"Objections \" or \"Objs.\") \n(D.I. 21); \nWHEREAS , on March 22, Plaintiff Brandon Dodd (\"Plaintiff ' or \"Dodd\") responded to \nDefendant's Objections (\"Response \" or \"Resp.\") (D.I. 24); \nWHEREAS , the Court has considered the parties' objections and responses de novo, see \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(l); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); Brown v. Astrue, 649 F.3d 193, 195 (3d Cir. \n2011); \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Defendant 's Objections (D.I. 21) are OVERRULE D, Judge Burke's Report (D.I. \n20) is ADOPTED, and Defendant 's motion (D.I. 5) is DENIED. \n1 2. The Report outlines two separate bases for its recommendation that the Court \ndeny Defendant's motion. Defendant objects only to the first basis: that it has not established its \nstatute-of-limitations affirmative defense because it is not apparent on the face of the Complaint \nthat Dodd's claims are time-barred . \n3. As the Report explains, Dodd's Complaint alleges that he received a Right to Sue \nletter from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on September 28, \n2020 and timely filed his Complaint on December 23, 2020, within 90 days ofreceiving the \nletter as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). Defendant argues Judge Burke improperly treats \nthis letter as valid, despite having received contrary evidence. (See Objs. at 2) In particular, the \nCity argues Judge Burke should have considered the exhibits attached to its opening brief in \nsupport of its motion- namely, a September 9, 2020 Right to Sue letter (D.I. 5-3 Ex. A), an \nemail reflecting that said letter was sent to counsel for the parties on September 9, 2020 (id. Ex. \nB), and a January 12, 2021 Notice oflntent to Rescind the September 28, 2020 letter from the \nEEOC (id. Ex. C). (See Objs. at 2) Together , in the City's view, these documents establish that \nthe September 9, 2020 letter is the only valid Right to Sue letter, and accordingly, absent some \nexception, Plaintiffs claims are time-barred . (See id. at 2-3) \n4. As the Report notes, however, Defendant's assertions are premised on facts not \nreferenced in Dodd's Complaint or the exhibits to it. Further, the Court agrees with the Report \nthat the materials referenced in the City's exhibits do not fall under any of the categories of \ndocuments courts may consider on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, such as a \"document integral to or \nexplicitly relied upon by the plaintiff in framing the pleading,\" an \"undisputedly authentic \ndocument that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims \nare based on the document,\" matters \"incorporated by reference or integral to the claim, items \n2 subject to judicial notice, [ and] matters of public record.\" D.M ex rel. Ray v. Phi/a. Housing \nAuth., 613 F. App'x 187, 189 n.6 (3d Cir. 2015) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \n5. It is not clear from the face of the Complaint that Dodd or his counsel received the \nSeptember 9, 2020 letter before they filed the Complaint , much less relied upon it in framing the \npleading or based Dodd's claims on it.1 Instead, the Complaint clearly relies on the September \n28, 2020 letter. (See D.I. 1 1 11 & Ex. B) The Court finds Dodd's reliance on that letter \nreasonable, as the EEOC had not yet issued its Notice purportedly rescinding it at the time he \nfiled his Complaint. (See Resp. at 3-4) \n6. For the foregoing reasons, the Report correctly concluded that it could not \nconsider the contents of Defendant 's exhibits and that there is no time bar \"apparent on the face \nof [Plaintiffs C]omplaint. \" Silla v. Holdings Acquisition Co. LP, 2021 WL 4206169 , at *1 (3d \nCir. Sept. 16, 2021). Denial of Defendant 's motion is, therefore , warranted.2 \nMarch 29, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware ~~~v \nHONORABLE LEONARD P. STARK \nUNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n1 Dodd and his counsel allege they were unaware of the September 9, 2020 letter at the time they \nfiled the Complaint. (See, e.g., D.I. 6 at 2-3) \n2 The Court concludes that the Report did not err in declining to convert Defendant's motion into \na summary judgment motion, as it appears Plaintiff did not have a reasonable opportunity to take \ndiscovery and present all material evidence relevant to the applicability of Defendant's \naffirmative defense. \n3 "}
