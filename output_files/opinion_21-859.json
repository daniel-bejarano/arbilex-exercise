No. 21-859-CFC \nJermaine Layton Carter, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro \nSe Plaintiff. \nApril 4, 2021 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION (JL ? /J~--11 \nCONNOLL Y, ChietJdge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Jermaine Layton Carter, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional \nCenter in Smyrna, Delaware , filed this lawsuit alleging violations of his federal rights by \nfederal actors. (0.1. 1) He proceeds prose and has paid the filing fee. The Court \nproceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a).1 \nPlaintiff has also filed a motion for default judgment. (0.1. 10) \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes . See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Se,vs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. \n2008). Plaintiff sues United States Senators Chris Coons and Tom Carper as well as \nthe United States Congress . He alleges a Bivens claim for violation of his right to Equal \nProtection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution .2 \n(Id. at 2-4) Plaintiff alleges that he was denied equal protection of the laws and \ndiscriminated against on April 11, 2021 and April 28, 2021. (Id.) \nPlaintiffs claim concerns his State Court \"guilty but mentally ill plea\". He states \nthat guilty but mentally ill-which is allowed in Delaware State Court-should be added \nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 to allow him to challenge the plea in a federal \nhabeas claim. (Id. at 5) Plaintiff wrote to Senators Coons and Carper about the issue \n1 Section 1915A(b)(1) is applicable to all prisoner lawsuits regardless of whether \nthe litigant paid the fee all at once or in installments. Stringer v. Bureau of Prisons, \nFederal Agency, 145 F. App'x 751, 752 (3d Cir. 2005). \n2Where a litigant sues federal actors for damages on constitutional grounds, the \nclaim is governed by Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971). \n1 but received no response. (Id.) Plaintiff would like to use 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 to sue \nDefendants. (Id. at 8) He alleges Defendants failed to enforce the law when they did \nnot add a \"guilty but mentally ill plea\" to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11. (Id.) \nPlaintiff alleges that since they did not, he cannot challenge the guilty but mentally ill \nplea in his federal habeas corpus petition. (Id.) \nPlaintiff seeks injunctive relief. \nIll. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who \nis immune from such relief.\" Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013). See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \ndefendant). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and \ntake them in the light most favorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224,229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his \nComplaint, 11however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations \nomitted). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 \nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112 \n(3d Cir. 2002). 11Rather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends 'on an 11indisputably \n2 meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or delusional\" factual \nscenario.\"' Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Hom, 318 F.3d 523, \n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28). \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto\u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before \n'1 \ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the Court must \ngrant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or \nfutile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114. \nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in \nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court \nconcludes that those allegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell \nAt/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \"detailed factual allegations\" \nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \"labels and \nconclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\" Davis v. \nAbington Mem'I Hosp., 765 F.3d 236,241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF \nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient \nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 57 4 \n3 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine \nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. \nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations \nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" that \nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nIV. DISCUSSION \nPlaintiff fails to raise a cognizable claim. The process to amend or enact a new \nfederal rule of criminal procedure is extensive and subject to multiple levels of review by \nthe Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, the Judicial Conference's Committee on Rules \nof Practice and Procedure, public commenters, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, the Supreme Court, and Congress. See 28 \u00a7\u00a7 2071-2077 (Rules Enabling Act \nof 1934). The Rules Enabling Act authorizes the Supreme Court to promulgate rules of \nprocedure, which have the force and effect of law. \nThe process is as follows: \nThe Judicial Conference's Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, \n(\"Standing Committee11\n) and its five advisory rules committees \"carry on a \ncontinuous study of the operation and effect11 of the federal rules as \ndirected by the Rules Enabling Act. [An] Advisory Committee[] on ... \n4 Criminal ... Rules evaluate[s] suggestions (i.e. proposals) for rules \namendments in the first instance. If an advisory committee pursues a \nproposal, it may seek permission from the Standing Committee to publish \na draft of the contemplated amendment. Based on comments from the \nbench, bar, and general public, the advisory committee may then choose \nto discard, revise, or transmit the amendment as contemplated to the \nStanding Committee. The Standing Committee independently reviews the \nfindings of the advisory committees and, if satisfied, recommends changes \nto the Judicial Conference, which in turn recommends changes to the \nSupreme Court. The Court considers the proposals and, if it concurs, \nofficially promulgates the revised rules by order before May 1, to take \neffect no earlier than December 1 of the same year unless Congress \nenacts legislation to reject, modify, or defer the pending rules. \nSee https://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/about-rulemaking-process/how-rulemaking\u00ad\nprocess-works. \nThe Complaint is defective because it sets forth no well-pleaded facts that give \nrise to civil liability against any Defendant. As just discussed, the rule making process is \nextensive and Congress takes no part in the rule making process until the completion of \nseveral steps. There are no allegations that any of those steps took place. Moreover, \nthe United States Congress is entitled to sovereign immunity as are Senators Coons \nand Carper who have legislative immunity. See Robinson v. Consumer Fin. Prof. \nBureau, 689 F. App'x 151, 152 (3d Cir. 2017). Therefore, the Complaint will be \ndismissed. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny Plaintiff's motion for default \njudgment (D.I. 10); and (2) dismiss the Complaint as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and (2). Amendment is futile. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n5 "}
