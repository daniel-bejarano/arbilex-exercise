Schaub, KA TIEN MU CHIN ROSENMAN LLP, Chicago, \nIllinois \nCounsel for Defendants Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. \nOctober 25, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware OPINION \n11 CHIEF JUDGE \nThis patent infringement case arises out of separate filings of New Drug \nApplications (NDAs) by Defendant Slayback Pharma LLC (Slayback) and \nDefendants Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex) with the Food & \nDrug Administration (FDA) for approval to manufacture and sell bendamustine \nhydrochloride drug products based on data from bioavailability and bioequivalence \nstudies contained in the approved labeling for Plaintiff Eagle Pharmaceuticals , \nInc.' s BELRAPZO \u00ae (bendamustine hydrochloride) Injection , I 00 mg/ 4 mL (25 \nmg/mL). \nEagle alleged in its Complaint that Defendants ' submissions of their ND As \nconstitute infringement of claims 2 and 4 of U.S. Patent No. 11,103,483 (the #483 \npatent) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27l(e)(2)(A). Both claims cover a \"ready to use \nliquid bendamustine-containing composition.\" Slayback and Apotex denied \ninfringement and alleged as defenses that the #483 patent is invalid. Apotex also \nfiled counterclaims seeking declarations that the marketing and sales of its \nproposed product would not infringe the #483 patent and that the #483 patent is \ninvalid. \nAt the parties' request, I scheduled two days for a bench trial. The parties \npresented their respective cases on infringement on the first day of trial. The only disputed infringement issue was whether Defendants' proposed products are \n\"ready to use.\" The parties stipulated that \"ready to use\" means \"able to be \ndispensed with minimal if any effort or preparation; prepackaged.\" Eagle's expert, \nDr. Graham Sewell, admitted at trial that Defendants' proposed products were not \nprepackaged; Defendants' expert, Dr. Michael Brandt, provided compelling \ntestimony that in my view established by more than a preponderance of the \nevidence that an artisan of ordinary skill would not be able to dispense Defendants' \nproposed products with minimal if any effort or preparation. Accordingly, I ruled \nfrom the bench at the conclusion of the first day of trial that Eagle had failed to \nmeet its burden to establish infringement by a preponderance of the evidence. That \nfinding made it unnecessary to address the validity of the #483 patent. Although at \ntrial I orally made the findings of fact and conclusions of law required by Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(l), I expand on those findings and conclusions here \nfor the benefit of the parties. Because I write for the parties, I assume familiarity \non the reader's part with the applicable statutory scheme and legal doctrines. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT \nA. The Parties \n1) Eagle is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in \nNew Jersey. D.I. 102, Ex.I ,r 1. The asserted patent is assigned to Eagle. D.I. \n1 02, Ex. 1 ,r 13. \n2 2) Slayback is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in New Jersey.

Eagle's NDA Products \n5) Eagle sells two liquid bendamustine-containing compositions in the \nUnited States: BELRAPZO\u00ae pursuant to NDA No. 205580, D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,r 27, \nand BENDEKA\u00ae pursuant to NDA No. 208194. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,r 41. The FDA \napproved BELRAPZO\u00ae on May 15, 2018. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,I 28. It approved \nBENDEKA\u00ae on December 7, 2015. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,r 42. The #483 patent is \nlisted in connection with BELRAPZO\u00ae in the FDA's Orange Book. D.I. 102 ,r 3. \nC. Slayback's NDA Product \n6) By letter dated October 31, 2018, Slayback notified Eagle pursuant to \n21 C.F.R \u00a7 314.52(c)(2) that Slayback was seeking FDA approval ofNDA No. \n212209 to market a bendamustine hydrochloride injection product. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 \n,r 52. \n7) On March 16, 2022, the FDA tentatively approved Slayback's NDA \nNo. 212209. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,r 54. \n3 D. Apotex's NDA Product \n8) By letter dated August 16, 2021, Apotex notified Eagle pursuant to 21 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 314.52(c)(2) that Apotex was seeking approval ofNDA No. 215033 to \nmarket a bendamustine hydrochloride injection product. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,I 55. \n9) On April 8, 2022, the FDA tentatively approved Apotex's NDA No. \n215033. D.I. 102, Ex. 1 ,r 58. \nE. The Asserted Patent Claims \n10) Eagle asserts claims 2 and 4 of the #483 patent. Claims 2 and 4 \ndepend from independent claim 1. \n11) Claim 1 recites: \nA ready to use liquid bendamustine-containing \ncomposition comprising: bendamustine, or a \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the \nbendamustine concentration in the composition is from \nabout 10 mg/mL to about 100 mg/mL; polyethylene \nglycol; and a stabilizing amount of an antioxidant; the \ncomposition having less than about 5% peak area \nresponse of total impurities resulting from the \ndegradation of the bendamustine, as determined by \nHPLC at a wavelength of 223 run after at least 15 months \nat a temperature of from about 5\u00b0 C. to about 25\u00b0 C. \n#483 patent at claim 1. \n12) Claim 2 recites: \nThe ready to use liquid bendamustine-containing \ncomposition of claim 1, wherein the antioxidant is lipoic \nacid, thioglycerol, propyl gallate, methionine, cysteine, a \nmetabisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, a \n4 phenol-containing aromatic compound, a \nphenolcontaining aliphatic compound, dihydrolipoic \nacid, or a mixture thereof. \n#483 patent at claim 2. \n13) Claim 4 recites: \nThe ready to use liquid bendamustine-containing \ncomposition of claim 1, having less than about 5% peak \narea response of total impurities resulting from the \ndegradation of the bendamustine, as determined by \nHPLC as a wavelength of223 nm after at least 15 months \nat a temperature of about 25\u00b0 C. \n#483 patent at claim 4. \n14) It is undisputed that Defendants' proposed products practice every \nlimitation of the asserted claims except for the \"ready to use\" limitation. \nF. The Parties' Witnesses \n1. Eagle's Witnesses \na. Expert Witness: Dr. Graham Sewell \n15) Dr. Sewell holds positions \"in both senior management of hospital \npharmacy, and as a senior academic\" in the United Kingdom at DeMontfort \nUniversity and the University of Plymouth. Tr. at 52:24-53:1; 53:23-54:2 \n(Sewell). He has a B. Pharm in pharmacy and a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences. \nTr. at 53:13-17 (Sewell). \n5 16) Dr. Sewell has dispensed at some point almost all drug products that \nare used in the United Kingdom. Tr. at 55:9-10 (Sewell). He has not dispensed \nbendamustine drug products. Tr. at 110: 1-18; 111:8-10 (Sewell). \nb. Fact Witness: Praveen Subbappa \n17) Subbappa is Slayback's Head of Alliance Management. Tr. at \n196:23-197:3 (Subbappa). He is Slayback's point of contact with the FDA. Tr. at \n199:13-14 (Subbappa). \nc. Fact Witness: Dr. Ripen Misri (by deposition) \n18) Dr. Misri testified by deposition as an Apotex 30(b)(6) witness. Tr. at \n225:18-25 (Misri). \n2. Defendants' Witness: Dr. Michael Brandt \n19) Dr. Brandt is a senior medical science liaison for Janssen Oncology in \nthe leukemia and lymphoma space. Tr. at 236:4-5 (Brandt). He also is a clinical \ninstructor and professor at various United States universities in their pharmacy \ndepartments. Tr. at 241:25-242:10 (Brandt). He received his Bachelor of Science \nin pharmacy from the University of Utah and his Doctor of Pharmacy (Phann.D.) \nfrom the University of Washington. Tr. at 239:5-8 (Brandt). \n20) Dr. Brandt has over 35 years of experience in practicing and teaching \noncology pharmacy, and he has prepared and dispensed thousands of \nchemotherapy doses, including doses in liquid concentrate forms. Tr. at 245: 18-22 \n6 (Brandt). He has dispensed BENDEKA\u00ae hundreds of times. Tr. at 238:18-21 \n(Brandt). \n21) Dr. Brandt was a very credible witness and gave compelling \ntestimony at trial. Tr. at 330:3-4. As I stated at trial: \"I've had more than a dozen \ntrials in the past year. And I think he was one of the most credible witnesses I've \nhad testify. He was very measured. He was direct in his answer to all the \nquestions. I [also] found his testimony to be inherently consistent.\" Tr. at 330:12-\n16. \nskill G. The Artisan of Ordinary Skill \n22) The parties stipulated and I therefore find that an artisan of ordinary \nwould have had the skills, education, and expertise of a \nteam of individuals working together to formulate a \nliquid injectable drug product. Such a team would have \nincluded individuals with doctoral degrees in chemistry, \nbiochemistry, pharmaceutics, pharmaceutical sciences, \nchemical engineering, biochemical engineering or related \nfields, with at least two years of post-graduate experience \nin developing liquid injectable drug products, or master's \nor bachelor's degrees in similar fields of study, with a \ncommensurate increase in their years of postgraduate \nexperience. Such a team also would have been familiar \nwith a variety of issues relevant to developing liquid \ninjectable drug formulations, including, among other \nthings, solubility, stability, pharmacokinetics, \npharmacodynamics, and other pharmaceutical \ncharacteristics. Such a team also would have included \npersons with expertise in analytical chemistry, including \nthe detection and measurement of chemical degradants. \n7 D.I. 112. The team also would have included skilled medical \nprofessionals that have experience in selecting, \ndispensing, administering cancer treatments including \ntreatments for patients with chronic lymphocytic \nleukemia and indolent B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. \nThe medical professional would have a medical degree \nand several years of experience in the clinical \ndevelopment of drugs, including cytotoxic drugs those \nthat are administered intravenously and are \nprescribed/ordered, dispensed and administered in a \nmanner that is safe and appropriate for patient treatment. \nThis team would further include individuals that are or \nhave regular interactions with oncologists, \npharmacologists, toxicologists, clinical oncology \npharmacists, specialty pharmacists, oncology nurses, and \nthe like. \nH. The Dispensing of Defendants' Proposed Products Requires More \nThan Minimal Effort and Preparation \n23) Drs. Sewell and Brandt essentially agreed at trial that the dispensing \nof a liquid concentrate bendamustine drug consists of the safe and effective \npreparation and provision of the drug in accordance with the applicable \nprescription to a healthcare provider for administration to the patient. See Tr. at \n253: 15-19 ( defining dispensing as \"all of the steps necessary between receiving \nthe order or the prescription from the provider, to the point where that is physically \ngiven to the person who will be providing it -or who will be administering it to the \npatient.\") (Brandt); Tr. at 62:1-5 (defining dispensing as \"preparing or providing a \npharmaceutical preparation in accordance with a prescription, normally from an \n8 experienced oncology doctor or hematology doctor, in a way that delivers safe and \neffective therapy to a patient.\") (Sewell). \n24) It is undisputed, and I find as a matter of fact, that because \nbendamustine is highly toxic and any unprotected physical contact with it could \nharm the dispenser and the provider who administers the drug, the dispensing of \nDefendants' proposed products must take place in a clean room. See Tr. at 266:8-\n10 (\"Under the OSHA guidelines, you need to have a hazardous drug cleaning \nroom or dispensing room as Dr. Sewell showed on there.\") (Brandt); Tr. at 104:25-\n105:2 (stating that bendamustine must be dispensed in the \"correct facilities\" \nwhich is a \"[clean] unit\") (Sewell); Tr. at 64:22-66:15 (describing the clean room); \nTr. at 64:25-65 :3 (\"This is actually a shot of a clean room that I designed and built \nin the hospital at Plymouth. And it produces around 58 to 70,000 doses per year of \ncytotoxic or SACT medication.\") (Sewell); Tr. at 69:6-10 (\"You have to imagine \nthat I'm using the clean room that I just described to you, but in order to prepare \nthis, we had to use-I just wanted to show the manipulations, and they are easiest \nshown on a bench top. That precluded the use of any cytotoxic drug.\") (Sewell); \nTr. at 194:1-2 (\"[Dispensing is] completed once the product has come out of the \n[ clean] unit.\") (Sewell). \n25) In light of the toxicity of bendamustine and the fragility of cancer \npatients, even the slightest error in dosage amount or quality could cause \n9 substantial harm to the patient. See Tr. at 64:14-17 (\"[C]ytotoxic drugs have a \nnarrow therapeutic window. There's very little difference between the dose that \n~ \ncan effectively treat the disease and a lethal dose, or certainly a dose that can cause \nsevere adverse affects.\") (Sewell); Tr. at 276:11-13 (\"[T]he difference between the \ndose necessary for safe and effective use in a patient and the dose that is toxic to \nthe patient is very, very close to each other.\") (Brandt). \n26) It is undisputed, and I find as a matter of fact, that the dispensing of a \nliquid concentrate form of bendamustine involves at least the following: ( 1) \ninspecting the vial of the drug to ensure it does not contain any particulate matter, \nTr. at 134:1-8, 134:23-135:3 (Sewell); (2) removing the vial's cap, Tr. at 81:8-9 \n(Sewell); (3) swabbing the vial's septum with alcohol, Tr. at 81:8-9 (Sewell); (4) \ninserting a venting pin into the vial to equilibrate its pressure, Tr. at 81 :8-9 \n(Sewell); (5) inserting the needle of a syringe in the vial, Tr. at 81:13-14 (Sewell); \n(6) withdrawing the requisite volume of the drug into the syringe, Tr. at 81 :13-14 \n(Sewell); (7) removing the syringe from the vial, Tr. at 131 :23-132:5, 141 :18-\n142:4 (Sewell); (8) inspecting the syringe to ensure it contains no air bubbles, Tr. \nat 81:15-16, 133:2-19 (Sewell); (9) adjusting the syringe's plunger if air bubbles \nare detected, Tr. at 81:15-16, 133:2-19 (Sewell); (10) verifying after adjusting the \nplunger that the syringe still contains the correct volume of drug, Tr. at 81: 15-16 \n(Sewell); (11) transferring the drug from the syringe into a diluent bag, Tr. at \n10 81:17-18 (Sewell); (12) thoroughly mixing the contents of the diluent bag, Tr. at \n81: 19 (Sewell); and (13) visually inspecting the diluent bag to ensure the absence \nof particulate matter and discoloration. Tr. at 81 :19-23, 138:11-20 (Sewell). \n27) Undisputed steps 8, 9, and 10 are not disclosed in the proposed labels \nfor Defendants' proposed products. See DTX 15; DTX 19 A. \n28) Dr. Brandt credibly testified, and I find as a matter of fact, that the \nlabel \"is the first, [but] certainly not the only document or publication that [a \npharmacist] look[s] at when ... dispensing a chemotherapy drug.\" Tr. at 261 :14-\n20 (Brandt). \n29) Dr. Brandt testified credibly, and I find as a matter of fact, that none \nof the undisputed steps in the dispensing process requires minimal effort or \npreparation. Each step must be performed with more than minimal effort and \npreparation because \"[t]here's nothing minimal or trivial about compounding a \nhighly toxic cancer chemotherapy.\" Tr. at 277:7-8 (Brandt). Each of these steps, \nif done incorrectly, can cause harm to a patient because of the small difference \nbetween an effective dose and a lethal dose. Tr. at 276:8-13, 277:13-14 (Brandt). \nThis harm is amplified for these products because cancer patients are fragile, so \neven a slight adjustment in the treatment can cause significant harm. Tr. at \n277:14-16 (Brandt). \n11 30) I also find, based on Dr. Brandt's testimony, that the aggregate of the \nundisputed dispensing steps involves more than minimal effort and preparation. \n31) Dr. Brandt testified, and I agree, that Dr. Sewell's characterization of \nthe dispensing process is a \"gross simplification of a very complex and serious \nprocess.\" Tr. at 258:9-10 (Brandt). \n32) As I stated at trial, I find Dr. Brandt's testimony to be more credible \nthan Dr. Sewell's testimony in part because, unlike Dr. Brandt, Dr. Sewell does not \nhave experience in dispensing bendamustine drugs, Tr. at 3 31 : 16-1 7, and because \n\"the real gist\" of Dr. Sewell' s testimony was \"a comparison of reconstitution \nversus having a liquid concentrate.\" Tr. at 331:17-19. I do not find that \ncomparison to be persuasive because the stipulated construction of\"ready to use\" \ndoes not require a comparison between lyophilized products and liquid concentrate \nproducts. The relevant question is whether dispensing liquid concentrate \nbendamustine products requires minimal if any effort or preparation, not whether \ndispensing those products requires less effort or preparation than dispensing \nlyophilized products. \n33) Finally, Dr. Brandt testified, and I find as a matter of fact, that the \ndosing steps required for Defendants' proposed products are part of the dispensing \nprocess. Dr. Sewell testified that the dosing steps are a prerequisite to dispensing, \nnot part of it. Tr. at 103:11-13 (Sewell). For the reasons noted above, I found Dr. \n12 Brandt more credible than Dr. Sewell generally. But on this particular point, I \nfound Dr. Brandt's testimony more credible for the additional reasons that \nDefendants' proposed products are packaged in a multi-dose vial-Le., more than \none patient can receive medication from the vial, Tr. at 187:15-21 (Sewell)-and \nbecause the parties agree that the dose varies for each patient. At its most basic \nlevel, \"cytotoxic drugs are generally dosed according to body surface area\" so a \nlarger patient will receive a larger dose. Tr. at 72: 10-11 (Sewell). But the dose \ncan also vary based on kidney function, blood type, white blood cell count, how \nthe patient is feeling, and many other factors. Tr. at 270:20-271 :25 (Brandt); Tr. at \n73:16-,-19; 74:3-6 (Sewell). The parties agree that sometimes these factors are \nknown in advance, but sometimes they are not discovered until the patient arrives \nto receive the medication. Tr. at 271:8-16 (Brandt); Tr. at 73:20-74:6 (Sewell). \nThat additional reason supports Dr. Brandt's testimony that dose modifications are \npart of the dispensing process and further supports my finding that dispensing \nDefendants' proposed products involves more than minimal if any effort or \npreparation. Tr. at 275:12-23 (Brandt). \nI. Defendants' Proposed Products Are Not Prepackaged \n34) Defendants' proposed products are not prepackaged. See Tr. at \n121:15-19 (\"Q. Okay. So the defendants' accused products are, in your opinion, \nnot prepackaged as far as this [claim] construction goes, right? A. As far as a \n13 POSIT A would understand, yes, because they are not a specific dose for an \nindividual patient.\") (Sewell). \nJ. Defendants' Use of \"Ready to Use\" in FDA Filings \n35) Defendants described their proposed products as \"ready to use\" in \nnumerous documents, including their NDAs, filed with the FDA. None of those \ndocuments, however, provide a definition of \"ready to use\" or shed sufficient light \non the meaning of the term such that it could reasonably be inferred from the \ndocuments that Defendants believed that their proposed products could be \ndispensed with minimal if any effort or preparation. \n36) Eagle adduced no evidence at trial that shows or even suggests how \nthe FDA defines, uses, or interprets drug applicants' use of the term \"ready to use.\" \n3 7) Accordingly, I find as a factual matter that Defendants' \ncharacterization of their respective proposed products as \"ready to use\" in FDA \nfilings does not establish that their proposed products can be dispensed with \nminimal if any effort or preparation. \nK. Dr. Brandt's Testimony Regarding Neulasta \n3 8) Eagle argued at trial that \"the most important admissions that Dr. \nBrandt gave were at the beginning when he said the only product he's identified as \nready to use is Neulasta and it requires only a couple of manipulations of the drug \nproduct before they are done dispensing [it].\" Tr. at 332:2-6. Eagle insists that it \n14 is \"not consistent\" for Dr. Brandt to maintain that Neulasta is ready to use but \nDefendants' proposed products are not. Tr. at 332:25-333:1. \n39) In fact, Dr. Brandt gave three examples of\"ready to use\" drug \nproducts at trial: Neulasta, EpiPen, and GVOKE. \n40) EpiPen and GVOKE are \"prefilled auto injector[s]\" that can be \nadministered by the patient without the help of a healthcare provider. To \nadminister them, the patient need only \"take [them] out of the container, take the \nlid off, and just literally jab\" the injector into the body. Tr. at 252:21-252:5. \n41) Neulasta is a brand name for pegfilgrastim, a medicine used to \nstimulate white blood cells in patients with cancer or who have been exposed to \nionizing radiation medicine. Neulasta is dispensed as a prepackaged syringe with a \nsingle, six-milligram dose that can be administered by taking it out of its box, \nattaching the needle, and injecting it into the patient. Tr. at 252: 13-17 (Brandt). \n42) Defendants' proposed products are not prepackaged, are multi-dose, \nand must be dosed individually for each patient. Accordingly, I find that Dr. \nBrandt's testimony regarding Neulasta is not inconsistent with his testimony that \nthe dispensing of Defendants' proposed products requires more than minimal effort \nand preparation. \n15 II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nUnder\u00a7 271(e)(2)(A), the filing of an NDA for a drug claimed in an Orange \nBook-listed patent or the use of which is claimed in that patent constitutes \ninfringement. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A); Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., \n496 U.S. 661, 678 (1990). Because \"the allegedly infringing drug has not yet been \nmarketed[,] ... the question of infringement must focus on what the [] applicant \nwill likely market if its application is approved, an act that has not yet occurred.\" \nGlaxo, Inc. v. Novopharm, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1562, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1997). \nAnalyzing infringement involves two steps. The first step is to construe \ndisputed patent terms consistently with how they would be understood by an \nartisan of ordinary skill. Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed. Cir. \n2005) ( en bane). The second step is to determine whether the accused products or \nmethods infringe the patent by comparing those products or methods to the \nconstrued claims. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed. \nCir. 1995) (en bane), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370 (1996). The first step in the infringement \nanalysis is a question of law; the second is a question of fact. Glaxo, Inc. v. \nNovopharm, Ltd., 110 F .3d 1562, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A patentee bears the \nburden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence. Envirotech \nCorp. v. Al George, Inc., 730 F.2d 753, 758 (Fed. Cir. 1984). \n16 The only disputed infringement issue is whether Defendants' proposed \nproducts meet the \"ready to use\" limitation of the asserted claims of the #483 \npatent. The parties stipulated, and I therefore conclude as matter of law, that \n\"ready to use\" means \"able to be dispensed with minimal if any effort or \npreparation; prepackaged.\" D.I. 42. \nAs discussed above, Eagle conceded that Defendants' proposed products are \nnot prepackaged. Eagle also failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat Defendants' proposed products can be dispensed with only minimal if any \neffort or preparation. Accordingly, Eagle has failed to establish that Defendants' \nfiling of their ND As constituted infringement of the asserted claims of the #483 \npatent. \n17 "}
