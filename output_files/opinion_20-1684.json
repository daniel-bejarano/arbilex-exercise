Dkt. No. 11.  For the reasons set forth below, the motion is GRANTED.  \n1. Background  \nThe plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against the defendants alleging breach of contract, \nbreach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, common law fraud, and promissory \nestoppel in connection with two contracts  entered into by the  plaintiffs and the defendants.  Dkt. \nNo. 1.  The plaintiffs also sought a declaratory judgment relieving them of any further obligation under those contracts.  Id.   The defendants, after each being served with a copy of the complaint, \nDkt. Nos. 5, 8, fail ed to answer or otherwise enter an appearance.  The plaintiffs filed a request for \ndefault, Dkt. No. 9, and the Clerk of Court entered a default on August 18, 2021, Dkt. No. 10.  The plaintiffs then filed a motion for default judgment.  Dkt. No. 11. 2 \n The first agreement at issue in this case is a Joint Venture Agreement (\u201cJVA\u201d) between \nMr. Shang and the Trust.1  As part of the JVA, Mr. Shang and the Trust agreed to form a limited \nliability company, LOCY, to engage in the business of selling electronic cigarettes, vaping \nproducts, and other similar products.  The defendants promised to transfer a 20% ownership interest in LOCY to Mr. Shang, but that interest was never transferred to him. \nThe second agreement at issue in this case is a Manufacturing, Supply, and Cooperating \nAgreement (\u201cMSC\u201d) between Shenzhen, Binzola, and LOCY.  Under the MSC, Shenzhen agreed to be the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of the devices sold by LOCY, and Binzola would become the exclusive supplier of a number of products used in the devices supplied by Shenzhen \n(e.g., CBD oil, hemp, marijuana).  Shenzhen also agreed that it would supply its devices only to LOCY.  \nThe MSC further provided that if LOCY purchased more than $20,000,000 in products \nfrom Shenzhen within a 12- month period at any point within two years of the execution of the \nMSC, Shenzhen would assign its rights in all of its patents and patent applications relating to electronic cigarettes and similar products to LOCY.  Both the JVC and the MSC further provided that each party would exercise its best effort in complying with the product delivery requirements.  But a s of the time this lawsuit was filed, LO CY had not made any purchases from Shenzhen. \nThe plaintiffs also allege that the defendants made a series of oral promises to the plaintiffs.  \nOne such promise was to provide CBD samples to the plaintiffs so that Shenzhen could use them in the manufacturing of its products.  Despite repeated requests from Shenzhen for the samples, the defendants never provided them.  The defendants also agreed to reimburse the plaintiffs for \n \n1  The facts of the case are recited as they are alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, Dkt. \nNo. 1, and the declaration of Ming Shi, Dkt. No. 211-2.  \n3 \n 50% of their product development costs, but  the defendants have not made any effort  to reimburse  \nthe plaintiffs for those costs . \nThe defendants do not appear to have communicated with the plaintiffs since May 13, \n2020, when they promised to reimburse 50% of the plaintiffs\u2019 product development costs.  After \nseveral months, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on December 11, 2020.  The plaintiffs now allege \nthat the defendants \u201cactually do not even have a business that handles the products\u201d contemplated by the JVA and MSC.  Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6  58. \n2. Discussion  \nThe process for obtaining a default judgment is outlined in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n55.  Under Rule 55(a), when a defendant fails to answer or otherwise defend a lawsuit, \u201cthe clerk must enter the party\u2019s default.\u201d  In this case, the Clerk of Court entered a default at the plaintiffs\u2019 request.  Dkt. No. 10.  Under Rule 55(b)(2), when a plaintiff\u2019s claim is not for a sum certain, the plaintiff  must then \u201c apply to the court for a default judgment.\u201d  The plaintiffs here have done so \nby filing their Motion for Default Judgment.  Dkt. No. 11. \na. Liability  \nIn the Third Circuit, courts consider three factors in determining whether to enter a default \njudgment: \u201c (1) prejudice to the plaintiff if default is denied, (2) whether the defendant appears to \nhave a litigable defense, and (3) whether defenda nt's delay is due to culpable conduct.\u201d  \nChamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000) .  In evaluating those factors, the court \ntakes the factual allegations in the complaint, except those relating to damages, as true.  Comdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142, 1149 (3d Cir. 1990) . \nWith respect to the first factor, the plaintiffs allege  that they will suffer prejudice by \ncontinuing to be bound by the JVA and MSC.  Dkt. No. 11 at 6.  Courts have noted that \u201cprejudice\u201d 4 \n refers to \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s ability to pursue its claim.\u201d  Am. Bridal & Prom Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. \nJollyprom.com , No. CV 17 -2454, 2018 WL 1226106, at *3 (D.N.J. Mar. 9, 2018)  (citing Feliciano \nv. Reliant Tooling Co., 691 F.2d 653, 657 (3d Cir. 1982) ).  When a defendant fails to appear or file \nany pleadings, the fact that the plaintiffs \u201cwill otherwise be unable to recover damages\u201d c onstitutes \nsufficient prejudice for purposes of a default judgment.  Sisvel Int\u2019l S.A. v. AnyData Corp., No. CV 19 -1140, 2021 WL 5168895, at *2 (D. Del. Oct. 27, 2021), report and recommendation \nadopted, 2021 WL 5332316 (Nov. 16, 2021) ; United Communities,  LLC v. Hallowell Int\u2019l, LLC , \nNo. CIV. 11- 2689, 2012 WL 5880295, at *4 (D.N.J. Nov. 21, 2012) .  Because the defendants have \nnot appeared in this case, this factor favors the plaintiffs. \nWith respect to the second factor, when a defendant does not answer the complaint or \notherwise enter an appearance, the defendant is  not viewed as having a litigable defense.  Am. \nBridal , 2018 WL 1226106, at *3; Sisvel , 2021 WL 5168895, at *2.  This is especially true in view \nof the fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 well ple aded all egations indicate that the defendants have breached \nthe JVA and MSC.  See Am. Bridal , 2018 WL 1226106, at *3.  I therefore find that this factor also \nfavors the plaintiffs.  \nWith respect to the third factor, when a defendant has been served with the complai nt, but \nfails to appear, its delay is viewed as culpable conduct.  See id.   Here, all defendants have been \nserved with the complaint.  Dkt. Nos. 5, 8.  Accordingly, this factor also favors the plaintiffs.   \nFinding that all three factors favor the plaintiff s, I conclude that a default judgment should be \nentered .   \nb. Remedies  \nHaving concluded that a de fault judgment should be entered, I must now address the \nremedies requested by the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs first request a declaration that they are no 5 \n longer bound by the JVA and the MSC.  A plaintiff may be discharged from its obligations under \na contract if the defendant materially breached the contract.2  C & J Energy Servs., Inc. v. City of \nMiami Gen. Employees\u2019 & Sanitation Emps.\u2019 Ret. Trust , 107 A.3d 1049, 1073 n.119 (Del. 2014) .  \nHere, the defendants\u2019 apparent failure to make any effort  to perform under the contract constitutes \nmaterial breach.   See Mrs. Fields Brand, Inc. v. Interbake Foods LLC , No. CV 12201, 2017 WL \n2729860, at *28 (Del. Ch. June 26, 2017)  (\u201cA breach is material if it goes to the root or essence of \nthe agreement between the parties, or touches the fundamental purpose of the contract and defeats the object of the parties in entering into the contract. \u201d (internal quotation marks a nd citation \nomitted)).  It is therefore appropriate to conclude that the plaintiffs are discharged from any further obligations under the JVA and the MSC. \nThe plaintiffs have  also indicated that they intend to seek attorney fees.  The JVA and MSC \nboth expressly contemplate an award of fees in the event of a breach.  Dkt. No. 211- 2, Exh. A, at \n8; Dkt. No. 211- 2, Exh. B, at 9.  The plaintiffs may therefore  move for attorney  fees and costs, in \naccordance with  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54( d)(2), following the ent ry of the judgment \naccompanying this opinion. \n3. Summary  \nIn summary, the plaintiffs are entitled to a default judgment due to the defendants\u2019 failure \nto answer the complaint or otherwise appear.  A  judgment to that effect will accompany this \nopinion.  \n  \n \n2  The JVA and MSC are governed by Delaware law.  Dkt. No. 211- 2, Exh. A, at 8; Dkt. \nNo. 211-2, Exh. B, at 9.  \n6 \n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n SIGNED this 4th day of March , 2022.  \n \n  \n      _______________________________ \n      WILLIAM C.
