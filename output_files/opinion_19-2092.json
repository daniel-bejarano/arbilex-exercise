But good -faith provisions do not bind the parties to reach a final deal. So when \none party breaches,  usually the other can  recover only the amount he lost relying  on \nthe promise to negotiate. Unless the preliminary agreement also binds the parties to  \nsome  terms of the final deal, he  cannot recover the amount he  would have made if  \nthat deal had gone through.  \nHere, White Winston and Good Ti mes signed a Letter of Intent, binding them to \nnegotiate in good faith . Because that Letter did not commit them  to any of the terms \nof the final deal, White Winston may recover only reliance damages.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nWhite Winston bartered  with Good Times to bu y its chain of burger joints, Drive \nThru. D.I. 96 \u00b6\u00b6  20\u221234. To ease  discussions, the parties signed a preliminary Letter \nof Intent, committing  them to \u201cdeal exclusively\u201d with each other  in good faith . D.I. \n111-3, at 755\u221256; Mem. Op., D.I. 93, at 5 . But just as the parties were about to sign \na final contract, Good Times tanked the sale by rais ing its price . D.I. 96 \u00b6  170.  \nI have  narrowed the case to just one claim : was Good Times \u2019s price demand a bad-\nfaith tactic  of the sort barred by the Letter ? See Mem. Op., D.I. 152 (granting sum-\nmary judgment in part and providing detailed facts). The answer must wait for trial . \nBut to focus the issues, the parties have asked me to decide how much money  White \nWinston could recover if Good Times did  breac h the Letter. D.I. 156.  3 The parties disagree over how to decide that  amount . White Winston says it can \nget expectation  damages \u2014the amount of money it would have made had Good Times \nsigned the final deal. D.I. 157, at 1. Pushing back, Good Times points out that the \nparties neither  signed the final deal n or agreed to any of its  key terms. So,  it says, \nrecovery should be limited to reliance damages \u2014the amount White Winston lost by \ncounting on Good Times\u2019s promise to deal in good faith. D.I. 156, at 2. That  difference \nmatters. Expectation damages are around $18 million , while reliance damages are  \nabout  $5 million . Id. (Of course, the  parties will contest the  actual amounts a t trial).  \nTo help decide, I heard argume nt at a pretrial conference. I now answer the dam-\nages question to \u201csimplify [] the issues\u201d for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(2)(A).   \nII. WHITE WINSTON MAY GET ONLY RELIANCE DAMAGES  \nIn Delaware, damages for breach of a preliminary agreement  depend on the  agree-\nment\u2019s  terms . See SIGA Techs., Inc. v. PharmAthene, Inc., 67 A.3d 330, 349 \u201350 (Del. \n2013)  (SIGA Techs. I ). The fewer final -deal terms  the preliminary agreement  nails \ndown , the less likely it is that parties  can recover expectation damages. Id. Here, the \nLetter did not bind the parties to  any final -deal terms, so White Winston may recover \nonly reliance damages.   \nA. The Letter does not fit into Delaware\u2019s  types  of preliminary agreement  \nDelaware courts recognize two established categories of preliminary agreement  \nwith a different  damages analysis for each. But the Letter does not fit into either box.  \nType I agreements \u201creflect a consensus on all the points that require negotiation \nbut indicate the mutual desire to memorialize the pact in a more formal document.\u201d \nCox Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. T -Mobile US, Inc., 2022 WL 619700, at *6 (Del. Mar. 3, 2022) 4 (cleaned  up). Those agreements are \u201c fully binding ,\u201d and expectation damages are al-\nways available for breach. SIGA Techs.  I, 67 A. 3d at 349 n.82.   \nType II preliminary agreements lock in less of the final deal. They \u201c do[] not com-\nmit the parties to their ultimate c ontractual objective,\u201d but instead require them \u201c to \nnegotiate the open issues in good faith.\u201d Id.  at 349 (cleaned up) . Still, to form a Type \nII agreement, the parties must \u201cagree on certain major terms .\u201d Id. Thus,  in SIGA \nTech nologies , the parties agreed to negotiate for terms \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those \nlaid out in a term sheet. 67 A.3d at 337, 346. Similarly, in Cox Communications , a \nsettlement contract \u201creflect[ed] agreement on certain major terms\u201d by stipulating \nthat one compa ny would enjoy  preferred status with another for a set  time, even if \nother provisions were still to be decided.  2022 WL 619700, at *6 (cleaned up) .  \nDamages for breach of a Type II agreement depend on whether the trial judge \n\u201cmakes a factual finding \u2026 that the parties would have reached an agreement but \nfor the defendant\u2019s bad faith negotiations.\u201d SIGA Techs.  II, 67 A.3d at 351. If he does, \nthe plainti ff can get expectation damages; if not,  the plaintiff  gets reliance damages.  \nThe Letter of Intent does not fit neatly into either category . It is not a Type I \nagreement because it did not \u201creflect a consensus\u201d on \u201call\u201d the terms of the final deal. \nCox Commc\u2019ns , 2022 WL 619700, at *6. Nor  is it a Type II agreement because it did \nnot commit the parties  to \u201ccertain major terms\u201d of the final dea l. SIGA Techs. II , 67 \nA.3d at 349. Indeed, the Letter did not bind the parties to  any major terms. True, it \nmemorialized the parties\u2019 tentative assent  to a sale price , deal structure, and financ-\ning. D.I. 111 -3, at 752\u221256. But it also said  that those terms were \u201cnot binding,\u201d had 5 \u201cno legal effect,\u201d and did not \u201cconstitute an obligation or commitment \u2026 to enter [the \nfinal deal].\u201d Id. at 755\u221256.   \nB. Because the Letter is a Type III contract, reliance damages are proper  \nBecause the Letter is not a Type I or a Type II agreement, it falls into a gap in \nDelaware\u2019s caselaw.  So I must predict what t he Delaware Supreme Court would do \nwith this question. See, e.g. , United States v. Defreitas, 29 F.4th 135, 141 (3d Cir. \n2022).  \nIt would likely recognize a third category of preliminary agreement \u2014Type III\u2014  \nfor which only reliance damages are available. Type III agreements are formed when \nparties sign a binding contact to negotiate in good faith but do not agree to any of the \nfinal deal\u2019s key  terms. For such  a contract, expectation damages can  never  be calcu-\nlated because the preliminary agreement does not nail down enough of the final  deal.  \nCf. SIGA Techs. I , 676 A.3d at 351 n.99 (\u201c[E] xpectation damages \u2026 presuppose [] that \nthe plaintiff can prove damages with reasonable certainty .\u201d). \nIndeed,  the leading Delaware case on preliminary agreements  hints at this third \ncategory.  When it developed the Type I\u2212II dichotomy in SIGA Tech nologies , the Del-\naware Supreme Court cited approvingly Fairbrook Leasing, Inc. v. Mesaba Aviation, \nInc., 519 F.3d 421, 430 (8th Cir. 2008). See 67 A.3d at 349 . There, the Eighth Circuit  \nallowed only reliance damages where a  preliminary agreement was \u201csilent on signif-\nicant issues,\u201d making it impossible to work out expectation damages. Fairbrook Leas-\ning, 519 F.3d at 430. And the c ourt could not supply those terms : doing so would \n\u201cjudicially \u2026. tra nsform a binding preliminary agreement to negotiate for a contract \ninto the contract itself.\u201d Id .  6 Plus, lower Delaware courts have held that reliance damages are the appropriate \nmeasure for bare agreements to negotiate in good faith. See, e.g. , Gillenardo v. Connor \nBroad. Del . Co., 2002 WL 991110, at * 5, 11 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2002)  (upholding \nreliance damages for breach of a lette r of intent committing the parties to negotiate \nin good faith but leaving \u201cthe final terms \u2026 to be negotiated.\u201d ).  \nThe Letter here resembles the contracts in Fairbrook Leasing and Gillenardo . \nThough it binds  White Winston and Good Times to negotiate in good faith, it does not \ncommit to  final terms or offer enough information to calculate expectation damages . \nD.I. 111 -3, at 755\u221256; Mem. Op., D.I. 152 , at 4 . True, when negotiations stalled, White \nWinston had offered to buy Drive Thru\u2019s stock for $8 million up front plus $1.75 mil-\nlion later. D.I. 96, Ex. C. But without a commitment, the parties could have restruc-\ntured the deal (perhaps as an asset sale of  some or all the stores) or changed the price. \nAnd revamping any of those terms  would change the expectation measure. Thus,  the \nLetter is a Type III agreement and  only reliance damages are available.  \nC. I do not have equitable discretion to award a disgorgement remedy \nAt argument on damages, White Winston contended  that I have equitable discre-\ntion to award unjust -enrichment damages for breach of the L etter.  Not so.  \nWhite Winston\u2019s  theory rests on a crumbl ing foundation: Vice Chancellor  Par-\nsons\u2019s initial ruling in SIGA Techs. , 2011 WL 43 90726 (Del. Ch. Sept. 22, 2011).  \nThere, he imposed an equitable lien on the breaching party\u2019s income stream . Id. at \n*34. Yet that ruling was reversed on appeal. 67 A.3d at 35 1\u201352. And on remand, the \nVice Chancellor awarded expectation damages for breach of a Type -II agreement  in-\nstead . See Siga Techs., Inc. v. PharmAthene, Inc., 132 A.3d 1108, 1136 (Del. 2015)  7 (SIGA Techs. II ) (upholding that award). Thus, no authority supports awarding a dis-\ngorgement remedy here.  \n* * * * * \n The parties\u2019 Letter of Intent bound them to negotiate in good faith  but did not \ncommit them to any of the terms of the final deal. So White Winston may recover only \nreliance damages.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nWHITE WINSTON SELECT ASSET \nFUNDS, LLC , and GT ACQUISITION \nGROUP, INC., \n \nPlaintiffs / Counter- Defendants,  \n \nv. \n GOOD TIMES RESTAURANTS, INC.,  \n \nDefendant  / Counter -Claimant . \n No. 1:19-cv-2092-SB \nORDER  \nIn letter briefs, the parties asked me to decide the measure of damages if Good \nTimes is found  to have breached the parties\u2019 Letter of Intent.

Now, to \u201csimplify [] the is-\nsues,\u201d I hold that White Winston may recover reliance damages if it proves breach at \ntrial. Fed. R. Civ.
