{"case_name": "Conformis, Inc. v. Medacta USA, Inc.", "case_number": "19-1528", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "06-03-2022", "ocr_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nCONFORMIS, INC. , \n    \n  Plaintiff,     \n       \n v.      \n  \nZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS, INC. , and  \nZIMMER, INC.,  \n \n  Defendant s.   Civil Action No. 19- 1528- RGA \nCONFORMIS, INC. , \n       \n  Plaintiff,     \n       \n v.        \n  \nMEDACTA USA, INC., and MEDACTA  \nINTERNATIONAL SA,  \n \n  Defendant s. \n    \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \n On October 14, 2020, Conformis  filed its Second Amended Complaint  (\u201cSAC\u201d) , bringing \nclaims of patent infringement against Medacta USA, Inc. (\u201cMedacta USA\u201d) and Medacta \nInternational SA (\u201cMedacta International\u201d). (D.I. 85). Defendants  move  to dismiss Conformis\u2019s \nclaims against Medacta I nternational  under  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), 12(b)(5), \nand 12(b)(6). (D.I. 107). Conformis  also brings a motion for leave to file a sur -reply  (D.I. 178), in \nlight of the availability of new evidence relevant to its opposition to Medacta International\u2019s motion to dismiss, which I now GRANT. I have considered the parties\u2019 briefing. (D.I. 108, 118, \n122, 178, 179, 186, 187). 2 \n  Medacta International argues for dismissal on three grounds: (1) insufficient service of \nprocess under Rule 12(b)(5), (2) lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), and (3) failure \nto state a claim of direct and contributory infringement under Rule 12(b)(6). I address  each of these \narguments in turn.  \nI. Insufficient Service of Process  \nMedacta International argues Co nformis\u2019s claims against it should be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(5) for \u201cinsufficient service of process\u201d because Conformis did not serve Medacta \nInternational with translated copies of all the exhibits attached to the SAC .1 (D.I. 108 at 5- 6). \nInstead, Conformis served a translated copy of the SAC  with an index of web links that direct to \nnon-translated copies of the exhibits, some  of which Medacta International claims  \u201cmaterial ly \ndiffer []\u201d2 from the docketed exhibits attached to the SAC. ( Id.). \nFederal R ule of Civil Procedure 4(f)(1) permits service of process on an international \ndefendant through the Hague Convention. Thus, to determine whether service of process was \neffective here, we must look to the Hague Convention, which sets guidelines for service of judicial documents between signatories, including the United States and Switzerland , where Medacta \n \n1  The SAC , as docketed, has seven attached exhibits: (1) U.S. Patent No. 8,377,129 (\u201cthe \n\u2019129 Patent\u201d), (2) U.S. Patent No. 8,460,304 (\u201cthe \u2019304 Patent\u201d), (3) U.S. Patent No. 9,186,161 \n(\u201cthe \u2019161 Patent\u201d), (4) U.S. Patent No. 9,295,482 (\u201cthe \u2019482 Patent\u201d), (5) Medacta International\u2019s \u201cSurgical Technique\u201d Guide for the MyKnee product, (6) screenshots from Medacta\u2019s  website describing the MyShoulder product, and (7) screenshots from Medacta\u2019s \nwebsite describing the Medacta Shoulder System. (D.I. 85- 1 Ex. A -C, 85-2 Ex. D -G). \n2  \u201cWhereas  D.I. 85- 1 provides the \u2019129 patent with a certificate of correction that modifies \nclaim languages . . . the web link Conformis provided Medacta International displays the original \u2019129 Patent without this certificate of correction,\u201d and, \u201c in place of D.I. 85- 6 and 85- 7, which show \nprintouts of websites in the  past, Conformis has merely provided links to the active website that \ncurrently exists.\u201d (D.I. 108 at 6). 3 \n International resides.  Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents \nin Civil or Commercial Matters , Nov. 15, 1965, 20 U.S.T. 361, 658 U.N.T.S. 163 (1969).  \nUnder Article 2 of the Convention, each signatory designates a central authority for \naccepting service, and litigants may serve documents on the central authority, which then forwards \nthem to the recipient. Id. , Art. 2. \u201c[T]he Central Authority may require the document to be written \nin, or translated into, the official language or one of the official languages of the State addressed.\u201d Id., Art. 5. \u201cIf the Central Authority considers that the request does not comply with the provisions \nof the present Convention it shall promptly inform the applicant and specify its objections to the request.\u201d Id. , Art. 4.  \nMedacta International argues Switzerland requires documents to be translated into the local \nlanguage of the authority addressed in order for service to be \u201cofficial.\u201d HCCH, Switzerland \u2013 \ncentral Authority & practical information, \nhttps://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=276  (last visited May 25, 2022) \n(\u201cSwitzerland declares that in cases where the addressee does not voluntarily accept a document, it cannot be officially serv ed on him or her in accordance with Article 5(1), unless it is in the \nlanguage of the authority addressed, i.e., in German, French or Italian . . .\u201d).  \nIt is not clear from the Swiss Guidelines, however, whether this translation requirement \napplies to all e xhibits accompanying the main document, here, the SAC , which was translated into \nItalian . Regardless,  the Central Authority for the Ticino canton of Switzerland did not object to \nConformis\u2019s request for  service, as it was required to do under Article 4 of the Hague Convention \nif it found the service did not comply with the provisions of the Convention, and indeed served the 4 \n summons, the SAC, and an index of the exhibits3 on Medacta International. ( D.I. 108 at 4; D.I. \n112-3). Because the Central Authority completed service on Medacta International without \nobjection, I find that Conformis\u2019s service on Medacta International properly complied with the \nrequirements of the Hague Convention, and, as a result, satisfied t he requirements of Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 4.  \nFor these reasons, Medacta International\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient service of \nprocess under Rule 12(b)(5) is DENIED.  \nII. Lack of Personal Jurisdiction  \nMedacta International argues the claims against it should be dismissed under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), because \u201cConformis cannot demonstrate that Medacta International has purposely directed any conduct at Delaware or the United States that gives rise to the asserted \ninfringement cl aims.\u201d (D.I. 108 at 10). I disagree.  \nI find that this Court\u2019s exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over Medacta International  \nis proper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2) . For a court to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a defendant unde r Rule 4(k)(2), the following requirements must be met: \u201cthe \nplaintiff\u2019s claim must arise under federal law, the defendant must not be subject to jurisdiction in \n \n3  I am not persuaded by Medacta International\u2019s argument that  service of process was \nineffective due to  the use of a  web-linked index rather than attachments, the lack of translated \nexhibits , or the fact that the linked exhibits differed slightly from the exhibits docketed with the \nSAC.  Conformis informed Medacta International that copies of the exhibits were available \u201cupon \nreque st to Conformis.\u201d (D.I. 112- 3 at 42, 76). Moreover, all the exhibits are either publicly \navailable U.S. patents or informational/promotional material prepared , in English, by Medacta \nInternational and its related companies . (D.I. 85 -1 Ex. A -C, 85 -2 Ex. D -G). In this case , Medacta \nInternational cannot seriously argue that it lacked actual  notice of the nature of the suit against it.  \nSee Burda Media, Inc. v. Viertel , 417 F.3d 292, 301 (2d Cir. 2005) ( citing a district court for the \nproposition that \u201ct he Hague Convention should be read together with Rule 4, which stresses actual \nnotice, rather than strict formalism.\u201d) (cleaned up). 5 \n any state\u2019s court of general jurisdiction, and exercise of jurisdiction must comport with due \nprocess.\u201d Touchcom, Inc. v. Bereskin & Parr , 574 F.3d 1403, 1412 (Fed. Cir. 2009).4  \nHere, the first two requirements are easily  met. Conformis\u2019s  claim is for patent \ninfringement, and therefore arises under federal law, and Medacta International has not identified  \nany state in the United States in which it can be sued. Id.  at 1415 ( \u201cif the defendant contends that \nhe cannot be sued in the forum stat e and refuses to identify any other where suit is possible, then \nthe federal court is entitled to use Rule 4(k)(2)\u201d) (cleaned up). Therefore, the only remaining \nquestion is whether this Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Medacta International comports w ith \ndue process. I find that it does, based on the actions Medacta International has taken to conduct \nbusiness directly with United States customers . \nTo determine whether due process permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction under Rule \n4(k)(2), \u201cwe mus t consider whether (1) defendant has purposefully directed its activities at \nresidents of the forum , (2) the claim arises out of or relates to the defendant\u2019s activities with the \nforum, and (3) assertion of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and fair.\u201d Id . at 1416 (cleaned up) . \n\u201cRule 4(k)(2) contemplates a defendant\u2019s contacts with the entire United States, as opposed to the \nstate in which the district court sits.\u201d Id.  (cleaned up). \nHere, there is ample evidence5  that Medacta International purpose fully directed  its \nactivities toward residents of the United States by directly collaborating with surgeons in the \n \n4  A district court should apply Federal Circuit law to determine whether it may  exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over out -of-state defendants in patent infringement cases. Hildebrand v. Steck \nMfg. Company, Inc., 279 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002) . \n5  Medacta International contends, \u201cConformis cannot demonstrat e that Medacta \nInternational has purposely directed any conduct at Delaware or the United States that gives rise \nto the asserted infringement claims.\u201d (D.I. 108 at 10). This is a factual challenge to jurisdiction. \u201cIn addressing a factual challenge to juri sdiction, the court may consider evidence outside the 6 \n United States to custom -design the accused products . These  activities are  integrally related to \nConformis\u2019s infringement claims.   \nThe process by w hich Medacta\u2019s MyKnee product, one of the accused products, is designed \nfor a U.S. patient is as follows. First, the U.S. patient\u2019s surgeon uploads  scans of the patient\u2019s knee \nto a portal operated by Medacta International. (D.I. 180- 1 Ex. 20 at 66:14- 67:14). From there, \nMedacta International engineers in Switzerland \u201cgenerate sort of a default plan based upon the \nsurgeon\u2019s default preferences .\u201d (Id.). The surgeon in the United States then has the opportunity to \nreview and propose changes to the plan, before  the plan is validated and production of the custom \nimplant begins in Switzerland by Medacta International engineers. ( Id.). The design process is \noverseen entirely by engineers from Medacta International; nobody from Medacta USA is \u201cactually involved in designing the MyKnee product from the images.\u201d ( Id. at 74: 3-75:4). The \naccused MyShoulder product is designed according to the same process, where the surgeon  in the \nU.S. \u201cindicates the patient for anatomic or reverse shoulder replacement, sends them \u2013  refers them \nout for a CT scan, scan is executed per the parameters, uploaded to the cloud, off it goes to Switzerland, they work their magic, and then a default plan is produced by the surgeon preferences.\u201d ( Id. at 83: 2-12). \nThis collaborative process by which Medacta International works directly with U.S. \ncustomers to custom -design the accused product s is precisely the sort of purposeful activity \n \npleadings  and is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear \nthe case. \u201d Creative Compounds, LLC v. Starmark Lab\u2019ys , 651 F.3d 1303, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2011)  \n(citing Lawrence v. Dunbar , 919 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir. 1990)) ; Gould Elec. Inc. v. U.S., 220 \nF.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000) . 7 \n directed toward the United States that fairly and reasonably subjects a defendant  to jurisdiction in \nthe United States.  \nFor these reasons, Medacta International\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction is DENIED.  \nIII. Failure to State a Claim  \nMedacta International  argues Conformis has failed to state a claim against it for direct and \ncontributory infringement.6 (D.I. 108 at 18- 19). In its answering  brief, Conformis  concedes to \ndismissal of its contributory infringement claim. (D.I. 118 at 17 n.11). Therefore, Conformis\u2019s \nclaim of contributory infringement is DISMISSED. \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) creates a cause of action for direct infringement against \u201cwhoever \nwithout authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United \nStates, or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent . . . \n.\u201d Conformis argues it has adequately pled direct infringement by alleging, \u201cMedacta International \nis presently making, using, offering for sale, and/or selling [ the accused products],\u201d and, \u201cMedacta \nInternational\u2019s direct infringement has included, but is not limited to, selling its products directly \nto Medacta USA for further dissemination to United States customers.\u201d (D.I. 118 at 17 -18 (citing \nD.I. 85 \u00b6\u00b6 36, 50, 70, 90)). The only other portion of the SAC Conformis cites in support of its \ndirect infringement claim is paragraph B of its Prayer for Relief, where it asks the Court for \ndeclaratory judgment \u201cthat Medacta International\u2019s importing, making, using, offering to sell \n \n6  Conformis also brings a claim of induced infringement against Medacta International. \nMedacta International does not argue for  the dismissal of that claim.  8 \n and/or selling at least MyShoulder products in the United States are and would be acts of \ninfringement of one or more claims of [the Asserted Patent s].\u201d ( Id. at 19 (citing D.I. 85 at 33 \u00b6 B)). \nThese bare, conclusory allegations are no more than a \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements \nof a cause of action\u201d and are therefore inadequate to survive a motion to dismiss. Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Nowhere does Conformis specifically allege infringing \nactivity by Medacta International taking place in the United States, as required by \u00a7 271(a). \nConformis asks that I read between the lines of its allegations regarding Medacta Internat ional\u2019s \nsales to Medacta USA  to find an implicit allegation of importation , because, it argues, these \nallegations \u201cstrongly imply that Medacta  International imports the accused products.\u201d (D.I. 118 at \n19). I decline to do so. While the standard for evaluating a plaintiff\u2019s allegations on a motion to \ndismiss requires accepting all of plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations as true and viewing them  in the  light \nmost favorable to the plaintiff, it does not require  a court to reach beyond what is actually alleged. \nBecause Conformis has failed to specifically allege any infringing activity by Medacta \nInternational occurring in the United States , Conformis\u2019s c laim of direct infringement by Medacta \nInternational is DISMISSED without prejudice.7 \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n Entered this 3rd  day of  June , 2022. \n   \n/s/ Richard G. Andrews ____ \nUnited States District Judge  \n \n7  Conformis asks for leave to amend its complaint \u201cto clarify its direct infringement \nallegations.\u201d (D.I. 118 at 20). If Conformis  wants to file an amended complaint, it has two weeks \nfrom the date of this Memorandum  to file a motion for leave to do so.  "}
