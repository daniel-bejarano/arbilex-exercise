Andrews", "date": "08-10-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nSALIX PHARMACEUTICALS , LTD.; \nSALIX PHARMACEUTICALS , INC.; \nBAUSCH HEALTH IRELAND LTD.; \nALFASIGMA S.P.A., \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nNORWICH PHARMACEUTICALS , INC., \nDefendant. Civil Action No. 20-430-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nThe parties have a dispute concerning the final judgment. (D.I. 190). I am entering a \nfinal judgment in accordance with the following rationale. \nPlaintiffs sued Defendant under\u00a7 271(e)(2)(A) of the Patent Act for submitting an \nabbreviated new drug application (\"ANDA\") to the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). At \ntrial, Plaintiffs asserted three patent families against Defendants: one on the product, one on the \nhepatic encephalopathy indication (the \"HE indication \"), and one on the irritable bowel \nsyndrome with diarrhea indication (the \"IBS-D indication \"). After a bench trial, I determined \nthat only the patents on the HE indication were both not invalid and infringed by Norwich 's \nproposed ANDA. \nThe parties dispute whether the final judgment ought to order the FDA approval date for \n\"Norwich 's ANDA No. 214369\" or \"Norwich 's ANDA with proposed labeling containing [the \nHE indication]\" as the expiry date of the HE patents. (D.I. 190) . \n1 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A) makes it an \"act of infringement to submit\" an ANDA \"for a \ndrug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent.\" Because the AND A's HE \nindication would infringe Plaintiffs ' patents, the ANDA submission is an act of infringement. In \nsuch cases, the Patent Act states, \"the court shall order the effective date of any approval of the \ndrug ... involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the \nexpiration of the patent which has been infringed .\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(4). Thus, the effective \ndate of the approval of this infringing ANDA must not be earlier than the expiration of the latest \nasserted HE claim. \nThe scope of my ruling is that the HE patents are not invalid, and that the HE indication \nwould infringe the HE patents. Norwich's proposed ANDA has the HE indication. I cannot rule \non facts that are not before me. That Norwich may seek to carve out the HE indication as \npermitted by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(viii) is immaterial to this analysis. That label is not before \nme. \nThe parties dispute whether I ought to enter injunctive relief. (D.I. 190 at 2, 4). I have \nnever had a hearing on whether injunctive relief should issue after a finding of ANDA \ninfringement , or so far as I can recall, even an argument in a pleading that it should not issue.1 \nAn injunction seems unlikely to make a practical difference when only method patents are not \ninvalid and infringed. The only reason I would enter an injunction directed at Defendant would \nbe to enjoin infringing activity that could be undertaken in the absence of FDA approval. But, \nthe absence of FDA approval blocks direct infringement of the HE method claims. Without that \ndirect infringement, Defendant cannot induce infringement. An injunction would therefore be \nredundant of the order barring FDA approval, because the FDA cannot approve the ANDA \n1 There have been disputes about the details of the injunctive language. \n2 before the patents expire. For that reason, I suspect it will be difficult for Salix to show \nirreparable harm. See Alcon, Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 2010 WL 3081327, at *2 (D. Del. \nAug. 5, 2010). Should Salix have a good faith belief that it is entitled to an injunction, it can file \na motion to reconsider the matter, and I will reconsider the matter. \n~ \nSo entered this / () day of August 2022. \n&J,\u00b5/~~ \nUnited States District Judge \n3 "}
