{"case_name": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation v. Alkem Laboratories Ltd. et al", "case_number": "19-1979, 20-2930", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "06-27-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIn Re: ENTRESTO (SACUBITRILN ALSARTAN) \nPATENT LITIGATION \nNOV ARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS \nCORPORATION, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nALKEM LABO RA TORIES LTD., et al. \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 20-md-2930-RGA \nCivil Action No. 19-cv-1979-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nOn September 3, 2019, Nanjing Noratech Pharmaceutical Co. (\"Noratech\") notified \nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (\"Novartis\") by letter that it had submitted to the FDA \nANDA No. 213671 for sacubitril/valsartan tablets (\"the ANDA Products\"). (D.I. 1 1 88; D.I. 3; \nD.I. 372-2). Noratech informed Novartis that Noratech had filed Paragraph IV certifications for \ntwo of Novartis's patents related to its drug Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan), United States Patent \nNo. 8,877,938 (\"the '938 Patent\") and United States Patent No. 9,388,134 (\"the '134 Patent\") \n(collectively, \"the Asserted Patents\"). (D.I. 372-2 at 2). On October 17, 2019, Novartis brought a \npatent infringement suit against Noratech and other defendants, alleging Noratech's ANDA \nproducts would infringe the Asserted Patents. (D.I. 11186-92 , 300-01). \n1 On December 8, 2021, Novartis provided Noratech with a covenant not to sue on the \nAsserted Patents and the parties stipulated to dismissal of Novartis's claims against Noratech for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. (D.I. 360). Noratech now moves for attorney fees under 35 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 285.1 (D.I. 370). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 371, 387, 398). \nI. Legal Standard \n\"The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing \nparty.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. An \"exceptional\" case is \"one that stands out from others with respect to \nthe substantive strength of a party's litigating position (considering both the governing law and \nfacts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\" Octane Fitness, \nLLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 554 (2014). In determining whether a case is \n\"exceptional,\" a court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including \"frivolousness, \nmotivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case) and \nthe need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\" \nId. at 554 n.6. \"[A] case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims \nmay sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award.\" Id. at 555. \n\"[T]he fact that the party's position does not prevail-or would not have prevailed if it had \nbeen litigated to conclusion -is insufficient by itself to warrant an award of fees.\" Sun Pharm . \nIndus. Ltd. v. Saptalis Pharm., LLC, 2020 WL 5077412, at *2 (D. Del. Aug. 26, 2020). \nA party may be considered the prevailing party for purposes of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 where the \nopposing party provides a covenant not to sue and stipulates to dismissing its claims. Blackbird \nTech LLC v. Health in Motion LLC, 944 F.3d 910, 914-15 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (affirming\u00a7 285 award \nafter voluntary dismissal and a covenant not to sue). \n2 II. Analysis \nNoratech argues this case should be deemed exceptional because (1) Novartis 's case lacked \n\"substantive strength,\" and (2) Novartis filed and litigated its suit in bad faith. (D.I. 371 at 13-19). \nI address each of these arguments in turn. \nA. Substantive Strength \nNoratech argues Novartis's suit was baseless because, \"Novartis performed no pre-suit \ninvestigation and never had any basis to believe that it could show that its infringement claims \nha[d] evidentiary support.\" (D.I. 371 at 13). I disagree. \n\"[T]he Hatch-Waxman Act gives a drug patent owner the right to bring an action for \ninfringement upon the filing of a paragraph IV certification. \" Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Royea \nLab 'ys, Inc., 69 F.3d 1130, 1135 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 27(e)(2)(A)) . Noratech 's \nparagraph IV ce11ification and Novai1is's good faith belief that Noratech's ANDA Products \ncontained sacubitril and valsartan in a form that could potentially convert to the claimed co\u00ad\ncrystalline form of sacubitril and valsartan provided a sufficient basis for Novartis to bring its \ninfringement suit. In re Cycloben zaprine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent \nLitigation, 693 F. Supp. 2d 409, 416 (D. Del. March 12, 2010) (in Hatch-Waxman litigation , the \nsubmission of an ANDA serves as an '\"artificial' act of infringement ,\" as \"the usual methods of \nsupporting an allegation for infringement ( e.g., securing and evaluating the accused product) are \nnot immediately available to the patentee\")). \nNovartis was under no obligation to forgo discovery by relying on Noratech 's \nrepresentation in its notice letter that Noratech 's ANDA Products contained physically separate \nsacubitril and valsartan, rather than the co-crystal of sacubitril and valsartan (\"TSVH\") claimed in \n3 the Asserted Patents. (See D.I. 371 at 13). Nor was Novartis required to accept Noratech 's pre-suit \nOffer of Confidential Access to its ANDA under terms it considered unreasonable.2 See In re \nCyclobenzaprine , 693 F. Supp. 2d at 416-17 (Rule 11 does not prohibit a patentee from bringing \nan infringement action based upon the submission of an ANDA, without reviewing the ANDA, \nwhere the ANDA filer has attached \"unacceptable conditions to its offer of access\"); Salix \nPharms., Inc. v. Mylan Pharms., 2017 WL 11681685 , at *19 (N.D. W.V. Sept. 12, 2017)(denying \nmotion for fees under \u00a7 285 where moving party's \"main contention is that, had the plaintiffs \nreviewed its ANDA prior to filing suit, they would have discovered that Mylan's ANDA product\" \ndid not infringe). I credit Novartis's argument that it believed attempting to negotiate reasonable \nterms for access to Noratech's ANDA within the 45-day window prior to filing suit would have \nbeen fruitless, especially here where seventeen different defendant groups were eventually \nconsolidated into a single MDL and negotiating a protective order acceptable to all parties took \nclose to four months and intervention by this Court. (D.I. 387 at 12; D.I. 388-2 Ex. 9 (Novartis \nsent first draft protective order on May 5, 2020); D.I. 119 at 63:21-66 :10 (Court ruling from the \nbench deciding protective order disputes) ; D.I. 122 (final stipulated protective order filed Aug. 31, \n2020)). \nWhen Noratech filed its ANDA submission , Novartis became entitled to perform its own \nreview of Noratech 's ANDA and related materials to assess the strength of its infringement \ncontentions . (D.I. 372-11 (Novartis explaining in its initial infringement chart, \"On information \n2 Noratech's Offer of Confidential Access included \"default prohibitions against experts or \nNovartis's in-house counsel in charge of patent litigation having any access to the ANDA and \nprovisions barring Novartis's entire outside law firm from engaging in any prosecution or FDA \nregulatory work for Novartis, regardless of subject matter.\" (D.I. 387 at 12 (citing D.I. 372-2 at \n3)). \n4 and belief,\" Noratech's ANDA Products contain TSVH \"in crystalline form,\" and Novartis \"will \nsupplement this response as Novartis reviews with its experts Noratech 's ANDA and research and \ndevelopment documents, ... and, if necessary , conducts appropriate testing on samples of \nNoratech's ANDA Products and/or their ingredients \")). That Novartis ultimately detem1ined , after \ndiscovery and review ofNoratech's ANDA and related materials , that its infringement theory was \nnot viable does not mean Novartis 's claims were \"exceptionally meritless.\" Octane Fitness, LLC \nv. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 548 (2014) (fees are not \"a penalty for failure to \nwin a patent infringement suit\" but are \"appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances\") ( cleaned \nup). \nB. Bad Faith \nNoratech's arguments regarding Novartis's bad faith litigation conduct rely heavily on \nspeculation and are premised on the assumption that Novartis's claims were baseless. (D.I. 371 at \n16). Because, as I have explained above, I do not believe that Novartis's suit was baseless, I do \nnot think that Novartis's litigation conduct makes this case exceptional. \nIII. Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, Noratech's motion for fees is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n~ \nEntered this~y of June, 2022. \n5 "}
