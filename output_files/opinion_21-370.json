{"case_name": "QAD, Inc. v. Block & Company, Inc.", "case_number": "21-370", "judge": "Judge Maryellen Noreika", "date": "04-25-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nQAD, INC., )\nPetitioner,\nv. Civil Action No. 21-mc-370-MN\nBLOCK & COMPANY, INC.,\nRespondent.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION!\n\nPresently before the court in this miscellaneous action to confirm an arbitration award are\nthe following motions: (1) respondent Block & Company, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cBlock\u201d) motion to vacate the\narbitration award (D.I. 4); (2) petitioner QAD, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cQAD\u201d) cross-motion for attorney\u2019s fees\n(DL. 9); and (3) QAD\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11\n(D.L. 15).? For the following reasons, the arbitration award is CONFIRMED, Block\u2019s motion to\nvacate the arbitration award is DENIED, QAD\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees is GRANTED, and\nQAD\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions is DENIED as moot.\n\nL BACKGROUND\n\nQAD is a software provider offering an end-to-end business process for handling the\nreceipt, shipping, invoicing, and payment of customer orders. (D.I. 5, Ex. 1 at 8) Block isa\nmanufacturer and distributor of cash handling products serving the financial, gaming, hospitality,\n\neducation, restaurant, retail, and vending industries. (/d.)\n\n' On December 7, 2021, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Judge to\nresolve the pending motions. (D.I. 21)\n\n2 The briefing and related filings associated with the pending motions are found at D.I. 5, D.I. 7,\nDI. 8, D.L. 12, DL. 13, DL. 16, D.L. 17, and DI. 18.\nOn October 26, 2018, QAD and Block entered into a contract (the \u201cCloud Contract\u201d) in\nwhich QAD agreed to provide its cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system to\nBlock in exchange for payment. (D.I. 5, Ex. 2) Specifically, the terms of the Cloud Contract\nrequired QAD to provide a hosted environment with the QAD licensed application and\ninfrastructure to support it, consisting of a development, test, and production server. (/d., Ex. 1\nat 9) A December 4, 2018 email confirmed that QAD satisfied these obligations by creating the\ncloud environment and loading it with the cloud applications. (/d., Ex. 1 at 10) The Cloud\nContract also included a provision limiting the parties\u2019 liability:\n\nNEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS\nOF PROFITS OR REVENUE.\n\nA PARTY\u2019S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT\nOF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, WHETHER\nIN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO 1.5X\nTHE AMOUNT OF THE FEES CUSTOMER PAID TO VENDOR OVER THE\nPREVIOUS TWELVE CALENDAR MONTHS UNDER THE ORDER\nDOCUMENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. THE FOREGOING\nMAXIMUM LIABILITY LIMIT SHALL NOT APPLY TO (1) DAMAGES\nARISING FROM DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR A PARTY\u2019S GROSS\nNEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR A BREACH OF\nOBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 7 OR 8; OR TO (2) INDEMNITY\nOBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 5.2, 10 AND 11 (FOR THE\nAVOIDANCE OF DOUBT EACH PARTY\u2019S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS\nSHALL COVER ALL CLAIMS MADE BY A THIRD-PARTY, INCLUDING\nCLAIMS THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED AS CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER\nINDIRECT DAMAGES).\n\n(d., Ex. 2 at \u00a7 12.1)\n\nSoon after entering into the Cloud Contract, Block executed a professional services\nagreement with Broom Street Software (\u201cBroom Street\u201d), a software consulting and application\ncompany, to assist with Cloud implementation. (/d., Ex. 1 at 9) Block\u2019s implementation of the\nCloud project was subsequently delayed due to the insufficient resources committed to the\n\nproject. Nonetheless, Block and Broom Street continued to work on the implementation process\nbetween January and July 2019, and QAD continued to provide support services during that\ntime. (/d., Ex. 1 at 10-11) Block paid its first invoice from QAD in the amount of $42,861.86 on\nMarch 29, 2019, but it did not pay any of the subsequent nine invoices QAD sent to Block\ntotaling $744,854.22, despite QAD\u2019s efforts to collect on those invoices. (/d., Ex. 1 at 11) Block\nclaimed its refusal to pay the invoices was justified by QAD\u2019s alleged failure to provide a \u201cGo-\nLive\u201d cloud environment as required under the terms of the Cloud Contract. (/d., Ex. 1 at 13)\n\nQAD served a demand for arbitration (\u201cDemand\u201d) on Block on July 9, 2020, pursuant to\nthe arbitration provision in the Cloud Contract:\n\n[A]ny dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or\n\nto the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, shall be\n\ndetermined by arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware USA before a single\n\narbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its\n\nComprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. ... The arbitral award may be\n\nenforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n(DL. 5, Ex. 2 at \u00a7 14.1; see Ex. 1 at 4) Block responded with counterclaims for breach of\ncontract and promissory estoppel against QAD. (/d., Ex. 1 at 5) In April 2021, Block indicated\nit had no intention of paying the outstanding invoices. (/d., Ex. 1 at 12) The JAMS arbitrator\nconducted a virtual arbitration hearing in June 2021 and subsequently entered a final award in\nfavor of QAD on August 10, 2021. (Vid, Ex. 1) The arbitrator concluded that \u00a7 12.1 of the Cloud\nContract did not limit QAD\u2019s damages and awarded QAD $744,854.22, plus costs and accrued\ninterest at a rate of 1 4% per month as of April 4, 2019. Ud., Ex. 1 at 17-18)\n\nOn September 10, 2021, QAD filed a petition to confirm the final arbitration award in\n\nthis court.? (D.L. 1) The following week, Block moved to vacate the arbitration award. (D.I. 5)\n\n3 In the Petition, QAD requested the court award damages as follows: (1) $744,854.22 in\ncontractual damages; (2) accrued interest as of September 10, 2021 in the amount of $172,107.51\nwith a per diem of $367.32 until final judgment is entered; (3) post-judgment interest at the rate\nof 1.5% per month from the date of the order through the date the judgment is fully satisfied; (4)\nQAD subsequently moved for attorney\u2019s fees and Rule 11 sanctions related to Block\u2019s motion to\nvacate the arbitration award. (D.I. 9; D.I. 15) The motions are now ripe for resolution.\nII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Arbitration Award\n\nThere is a strong presumption in favor of enforcing arbitration awards under the Federal\nArbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), and the party seeking to overturn the award bears the burden of\nshowing that the award does not merit deference. Brentwood Med. Assocs. v. United Mine\nWorkers of Am., 396 F.3d 237, 241 (3d Cir. 2005); see also Dunkley v. Mellon Inv\u2019r Servs., 378\nF. App\u2019x 169, 171 (3d Cir. 2010). Nonetheless, the court may vacate an arbitration award under\nthe FAA if the arbitrator exceeds his or her authority in reaching a decision. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\n10(a)(4). The question for the court in applying \u00a7 10(a)(4) is whether the arbitrator\u2019s award is\n\u201cirrational,\u201d meaning that the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement and cannot be\nrationally derived from the agreement, or that the record contains no support for the arbitrator\u2019s\ndetermination. Verizon Pa., LLC v. Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., AFL-CIO, Local 13000, 13 F.4th\n300, 306 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Ario v. Underwriting Members of Syndicate 53 at Lloyds for\n1998 Year of Account, 618 F.3d 277, 295 (3d Cir. 2010); Exxon Shipping Co. v. Exxon Seamen\u2019s\nUnion, 73 F.3d 1287, 1295 (3d Cir. 1996)).\n\nBlock contends that the arbitrator improperly disregarded the Cloud Contract\u2019s limited\nliability provision as unconscionable, despite conceding that the language of the provision is\n\nunambiguous. (D.I. 5 at 6-7) According to Block, the limited liability provision was drafted by\n\nfees and costs relating to the arbitrator and JAMS totaling $41,436; and (5) other fees and costs\ntotaling $16,794.97 plus the costs associated with the Petition itself. (D.I. 1 at 5)\n\n4\nQAD, and there is no evidence of a gross imbalance between sophisticated parties that fully\nnegotiated the term. (/d. at 8-10)\n\nIn response, QAD argues that the applicable case law prohibits a review of the merits of\nan arbitration award, even if the award allegedly rests on erroneous contract interpretations.\n(D.L. 8 at 8-9) Moreover, QAD submits that the arbitrator correctly applied Delaware law in\nfinding the limitation of liability provision unconscionable because Block would otherwise be\nable to avoid all liability for its breach despite QAD\u2019s full performance of its contractual\nobligations. (/d. at 10-12)\n\nThe court finds that Block has not satisfied its heavy burden to show that the arbitrator\u2019s\naward is not rationally derived from the agreement or supported by the record. See Oxford\nHealth Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569 U.S. 564, 569 (2013); Verizon Pa., 13 F.4th at 306. \u201c[T]he sole\nquestion for [the court] is whether the arbitrator (even arguably) interpreted the parties\u2019 contract,\nnot whether he got its meaning right or wrong.\u201d Oxford Health Plans, 569 U.S. at 569. Here,\nthe arbitrator thoroughly considered and construed the Cloud Contract before reaching his\ndetermination. (D.I. 5, Ex. 1) Block does not substantively challenge the arbitrator\u2019s\nconclusions that QAD fulfilled its obligations under the terms of the Cloud Contract,\u2019 or that the\nlimited liability provision at \u00a7 12.1 of the Cloud Contract was unambiguous. (D.I. 5 at 6-11; Ex.\n\n1 at 13-16)\n\n\u2018In its summary of the factual background in the motion to vacate, Block represents that it\n\u201cnever received a \u2018Go-Live\u2019 Cloud Environment (i.e., a usable product),\u201d and it \u201cdid not pay the\nremaining invoices on the basis that QAD failed to deliver a cloud environment in accordance\nwith its obligations under the Cloud Contract.\u201d (D.I. 5 at 3) QAD\u2019s Rule 11 motion is based on\nthese representations, which it argues are inconsistent with the arbitrator\u2019s findings. (D.I. 16 at\n12-13) Block does not rely on QAD\u2019s alleged failure to satisfy its obligations under the Cloud\nContract as a basis for vacating the arbitration award.\nThe heart of the dispute is whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority under \u00a7 10(a)(4)\nin failing to enforce an unambiguous limited liability provision in the Cloud Contract and\ndeclaring it unconscionable. Block cites cases finding that an unambiguous limited liability\nprovision should be enforced. See, e.g., Galantino v. Baffone, 46 A.3d 1076, 1081 n.9 (Del.\n2012) (stating that unambiguous contract language should be enforced as written); eCommerce\nIndus., Inc. v. MWA Intel., Inc., 2013 WL 5621678, at *45 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013) (noting that\nlimited liability clauses are typically enforceable). Block argues unconscionability is difficult to\nestablish when the contracting parties are sophisticated commercial entities. See, e.g., Ketler v.\nPFPA, LLC, 132 A.3d 746, 748 (Del. 2016) (\u201cUnconscionability is a concept that is used\nsparingly.\u201d); Pig Improvement Co., Inc. v. Middle States Holding Co., 943 F. Supp. 392, 402 (D.\nDel. 1996) (declining to find unambiguous contract provision unconscionable in the commercial\nsetting). But the court \u201cmay not review the merits of [an arbitration] award,\u201d even in the case of\nserious legal error. Verizon Pa., 13 F.4th at 306; see Oxford Health Plans, 569 U.S. at 569 (\u201cIt is\nnot enough . . . to show that the [arbitrator] committed an error\u2014or even a serious error.\u201d). Even\nif the arbitrator erred in his interpretation of the case law on unconscionability, the result would\nnot change because \u201c[e]xceeding one\u2019s powers . . . is not synonymous with making a mistake.\u201d\nRoss Dress for Less Inc. v. VIWP, L.P., 750 F. App\u2019x 141, 145 (3d Cir. 2018).\n\nHere, the arbitrator based his assessment of unconscionability on the following facts: (1)\nBlock received the requisite services from QAD under the Cloud Contract; (2) Block unilaterally\ndelayed the completion of the implementation phase; (3) Block repeatedly promised to pay for\nthe services received; and (4) Block cited its failure to pay for services rendered as a basis to\navoid liability under \u00a7 12.1 of the Cloud Contract. (Jd. at 13-14, 16) These factual findings were\n\nthen viewed in the context of Delaware cases assessing limited liability provisions. (/d. at 16-17)\nThe arbitrator considered the case authorities submitted by Block, noting many were\nfrom jurisdictions other than Delaware. (D.I. 5, Ex. 1 at 16) The arbitrator was not persuaded by\nthe two Delaware cases Block cited, which involved limitation of liability provisions in software\ncontracts similar to the Cloud Contract in issue. See eCommerce Indus., Inc. v. MWA\nIntelligence, Inc., 2013 WL 5621678 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2013) (upholding a limitation of\nliability provision despite the plaintiffs\u2019 willful or bad faith breach of the contract); Tibco\nSoftware Inc. v. Mediamath, Inc., 2019 WL 3034781 (Del. Super. Ct. July 10, 2019) (declining\nto enforce a limited liability provision because \u201cno reasonable party would conclude that a\nfailure to pay fees owed under an enforceable contract can be the same basis used to avoid\nresponsibility for the same fees.\u201d). The cases reached different outcomes, and the arbitrator\nfound these unpublished decisions unpersuasive. (D.I. 5, Ex. 1 at 16)\n\nThe arbitrator adopted the reasoning of Hampton v. Warren-Wolfe Assocs., Inc., 2004\nWL 838847 (Del. Super. Ct. Mar. 25, 2004), which held that a contractual provision exonerating\na party from the consequences of its own conduct is disfavored and that questions of\nunconscionability are reserved for the trier of fact. Based on his authority as trier of fact, the\narbitrator ruled the limited liability provision is unconscionable and could not be used by Block\nto avoid payment of the invoices. Even if the arbitrator made a mistake in following the\nHampton decision,> that \u201cmistake\u201d is not enough to vacate the award under \u00a7 10(a)(4) of the\nFAA. The arbitrator\u2019s decision arises from the essence of the contract, i.e., his interpretation of\n\nan unambiguous limited liability provision and its unenforceability as unconscionable under\n\n5 Block characterizes the contract in Hampton as an adhesion contract that was not negotiated by\nsophisticated parties. (D.I. 5 at 10) But the court in Hampton emphasized that it had \u201cno\ninformation regarding the parties\u2019 negotiations involving this contract\u201d because the case was\n\u201cstill in the discovery stages, and the question of unconscionability is one that remain[ed] for the\ntrier of fact to decide.\u201d Hampton, 2004 WL 838847, at *3.\nDelaware law. This court cannot relitigate the merits of unconscionability, regardless of whether\nthe arbitrator reached the correct decision. See Ario, 618 F.3d at 295-96 (stating that there must\nbe \u201cabsolutely no support at all in the record justifying the arbitrator\u2019s determinations for a court\nto deny enforcement of an award\u201d under the \u201cirrationality\u201d standard of the FAA). Accordingly,\nthe court \u201caffirm[s] easily the arbitration award under this extremely deferential standard\u201d and\ndenies Block\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award. Dluhos v. Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 370\n(3d Cir. 2003).\n\nB. Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n\u201cTn suits to compel one party to submit to arbitration or abide by an award, fees are\ngenerally awarded if the defaulting party acted without justification, or if the party resisting\narbitration did not have a reasonable chance to prevail.\u201d Chauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers,\nLocal Union No. 765 v. Stroehmann Bros. Co., 625 F.2d 1092, 1094 (3d Cir. 1980) (internal\ncitations and quotation marks omitted). This policy is intended to discourage \u201ccreativity\u201d by a\nlosing party attempting to escape the consequences of its voluntary bargain to submit to\narbitration. See Mitchell Plastics, Inc. v. Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics & Allied Workers Int'l\nUnion, 946 F. Supp. 401, 408 (W.D. Pa. 1996) (\u201c[T]he party who challenges an arbitration award\nsimply must give closer scrutiny to his decision, leaving as little room as possible for the risk that\nhis creativity will be construed as a repudiation of his own choice that courts properly should\ndiscourage.\u201d).\n\nThe award of attorney\u2019s fees is committed to the discretion of this court and may only be\nreversed on appeal if it is determined to be an abuse of discretion. See Wilkes Barre Hosp. Co.,\nLIC v. Wyo. Valley Nurses Ass\u2019n Pasnap, 453 F. App\u2019x 258, 260 (3d Cir. 2011); Teamsters\n\nLocal Union No. 764 v. J.H. Merritt & Co., 770 F.2d 40, 43 n.2 (3d Cir. 1985).\nQAD contends that Block should be ordered to compensate it for attorney\u2019s fees spent\nresponding to Block\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award because the motion is frivolous.\n(DL. 8 at 15) According to QAD, Block did not have a reasonable chance of prevailing on the\nmotion to vacate, which involves claims of purported factual and legal error by the arbitrator.\n(id. at 16) Block responds that attorney\u2019s fees are not justified in this instance because it\nsupported its position with authority and continues to believe it has a reasonable chance of\nsuccess on the merits. (D.I. 12 at 3-4)\n\nBlock did not have a reasonable chance to prevail on its motion to vacate because district\ncourts have extremely limited authority to vacate arbitration awards. See Ario, 618 F.3d at 296\n(\u201c[T]he test used to probe the validity of a[n] . . . arbitrator\u2019s decision is a singularly\nundemanding one.\u201d). The terms of the Cloud Contract confirm that Block agreed to resolve\ndisputes between itself and QAD through binding arbitration. (D.I. 5, Ex. 2 at \u00a7 14.1) For the\nreasons set forth at \u00a7 IJ.A, supra, the arbitrator\u2019s award was amply supported by the record and\nby legal authority, and his construction and application of the Cloud Contract\u2019s limited liability\nprovision were clearly within the scope of his authority. Because Block did not have \u201ca\nreasonable chance to prevail,\u201d Chauffeurs, 625 F.2d at 1094, QAD\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is\ngranted.\n\nC. Rule 11 Sanctions\n\nThe relief sought by QAD in its Rule 11 motion for sanctions largely overlaps with the\nrelief sought in QAD\u2019s cross-motion for attorney\u2019s fees.\u00b0 (Compare D.1. 9 at 2 with D.I. 16 at\n\n14) The court granted QAD\u2019s cross-motion for attorney\u2019s fees for the reasons set forth at \u00a7 II.B,\n\n6 For example, pages 8 to 11 of the argument section in QAD\u2019s opening brief in support of its\nRule 11 motion are copied nearly verbatim from pages 6 to 10 of QAD\u2019s brief in response to\nBlock\u2019s motion to vacate. (Compare D.I. 16 at 8-11 with D.L 8 at 6-10)\nsupra, and QAD\u2019s Rule 11 motion for sanctions does not clearly establish a basis for additional\nrelief beyond that which has already been granted.\u2019 See Napier v. Thirty or More Unidentified\nFed. Agents, Emps. or Officers, 855 F.2d 1080, 1094 (3d Cir. 1988) (denying recovery of\ncounsel fees for duplicative efforts). Consequently, QAD\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions is\ndenied as moot. The court will not permit the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees associated with the\nduplicative Rule 11 motion for sanctions because allowing such a recovery would run counter to\nthe purpose of Rule 11 to \u201cdiscourage wasteful and abusive tactics.\u201d Cohen v. Kurtzman, 45 F.\nSupp. 2d 423, 435 (D.N.J. 1999).\nII. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the arbitration award is CONFIRMED, Block\u2019s motion to\nvacate the arbitration award (D.I. 4) is DENIED, QAD\u2019s cross-motion for attorney\u2019s fees (D.I. 9)\nis GRANTED, and QAD\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions (D.I. 15) is DENIED as moot. On or\nbefore May 2, 2022, QAD shall submit a proposed form of order that includes all relief\n\nrequested in the Petition to confirm the arbitration award, plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred\n\n7 QAD alleges that Rule 11 sanctions are warranted because Block misrepresented the findings\nof the arbitrator in its motion to vacate. (D.I. 16 at 12-13) But the court finds that Block\u2019s brief\nclearly delineates its own positions from those taken by the arbitrator. QAD\u2019s argument about\nmisrepresentations to the court is further undercut by its own citation errors. For instance, QAD\nincludes a quote on the standard of \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d and attributes it to the\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Hail Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576 (2008).\n(DI. 13 at 2) The quote does not appear in Hall Street. Instead, it appears to be from Fluke v.\nCashCall, Inc., 792 F. Supp. 2d 782, 786 (E.D. Pa. 2011), a district court decision which is not\nbinding on this court.\n\n10\nup to and including the completion of briefing on QAD\u2019s cross-motion for attorney\u2019s fees. An\n\nOrder consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\n\nDated: April 25, 2022\n\n"}
