(D.I. 50 )  For  the reasons that follow, the Court recommends that the \nMotion be GRANTED and that the SAC\u2019s claims against Continental be dismissed . \nI. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background \nThis matter arises from the August 17, 2019 crash of a Cessna T303 aircraft (the \n\u201caircraft\u201d) in Lagrangeville, New York.  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6 17)  The aircraft  was piloted by Francisco \nKnipping- Diaz and it held two passengers, Teofilo Antonio Diaz and Eduardo Tio.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  20-\n21)  Shortly after takeoff from an airport in Lagrangeville, the aircraft lost engine power at a low 2 altitude and was unable to climb.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 22, 25 , 62)  As a result of this failure to climb, the \npilot lost directional control and the aircraft began to drift left; thereafter , it rolled left and \nultimately crashed and hit the Bocker family\u2019s residence.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  26-27, 62, 64- 65)  Both the \naircraft and the Bocker residence burst into flames.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 29, 65 ) \nInside the Bocker residence at the time were Gerard Bocker and his daughters , Plaintiffs \nHannah Bocker and Sarah Bocker.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 28)  Mr. Bocker died due to the crash.  ( Id. at \u00b6  \n31)  Hannah Bocker lived but was severely burned.  ( Id. at \u00b6  32)  Sarah Bocker also lived; she \nwas able to jump out of a window of the house and suffered some resulting injuries .  (Id. at \u00b6  33)  \nPlaintiff Barbara Bocker, Mr. Bocker\u2019s wife and the mother of Hananh and Sarah Bocker , was \nnot on site;  she was later named as the Administrator of Mr. Bocker\u2019s estate.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5; D.I. \n51 at 2)  The pilot, Mr. Knipping- Diaz, died in the crash, while the two passengers survived.  \n(D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6  20-21) \nThe aircraft was equipped with two (L)TSIO -520-AE3B piston engines  (\u201cthe engines\u201d) ; \nthese engines were designed and manufactured by Continental .  (Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 36-37)  The SAC \nalleges that the reason the aircraft crashed was that its engines were not capable of making \nsufficient power to remain airborne and suffered a \u201cpowerplant failure [,]\u201d leaving them \u201cunable \nto perform as a result.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 67, 73)  The SAC also makes clear, in turn, that :  (1) the \nengines were \u201cequipped with turbo components [,]\u201d referred to in the SAC as \u201ct urbochargers [,]\u201d \nwhich had been \u201cincorporat[ed]\u201d into the engines at some point after the engines were \nmanufactured ; (2) the purpose of turbocharging an engine is to increase its performance at higher \naltitudes, as the air thins and becomes less dense, so that the fuel/air  mixture can remain at or \nclose to sea level ; and (3) it was these turbochargers that \u201cmalfunction[ed]\u201d and that \u201ccause[d] 3 and contribute[d] to the power loss experienced on board the aircraft[,]\u201d resulting in the crash.  \n(Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 36, 45, 79, 89; see als o D.I. 51 at 10; D.I. 55 at 4)   \nThe SAC appears to allege two possible theories as to why or how the aircraft crashed , \nboth of which appear to be related to the engine\u2019s turbochargers.1  First , it notes that if the \nfuel/air mixture provided to the engine is not appropriate, or if the aircraft does not provide sufficient fuel or fuel free of contaminants, then the engine will not be able to make \u201crated power[.]\u201d  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6  68, 71)  The SAC also explains that if a \u201cturbocharger malfunctions or \nseizes\u201d then this can cause the engine to \u201c not receive an appropriate fuel/air mixture and [that \nwill, in turn] cause a loss of power.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 46)  And it asserts that just before the crash, \u201cthe \nsignatures in the propellers and control levers confirm that the aircraft was not making rated \npower on takeoff.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 72)  Second, the SAC notes that \u201cinvestigation reveal[ed] that the \naircraft\u2019s turbocharger wastegates were in vastly different positio ns, with the left wastegate \nnearly closed, confirming that the engine was demanding additional boost in reaction to a malfunction of the engine\u201d and that post- accident, there was evidence of a \u201cturbocharger seizure \nor induction blockage\u201d that had caused the left \u201c wastegate on [ the] engine [ to] attempt to raise \nthe manifold pressure[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 69-70) \nIn the factual background section s of the SAC ,\n2 Plaintiffs repeatedly plead that \nDefendant Hartzell Engine Technologies , LLC  (\u201cHartzell\u201d) \u201cmade\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d  the \n \n1  It could be that these allegations (which  are mixed together largely  in paragraphs \n68 to 72 of the SAC) are not meant to reference to two separate theories, but instead one \ncombined theory.  It is difficult to say since the SAC, as will be further discussed below, is difficult to construe.   \n2  The SAC is structured as follows.  First, there is a section titled \u201cThe Parties\u201d \n(which provides some basic factual allegations about the parties to the suit) and one titled \u201cJurisdiction and Venue\u201d (which includes Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about those subjects).  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-16)  Next, there are three sections in which Plaintiffs appear to be laying out the facts 4 turbochargers and their associated components  (including wastegates and controllers ) that were a \npart of the engines in the accident aircraft ; the SAC also states that these turbochargers were \u201cthe \nresponsibility of the defendant Ha rtzell.\u201d   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49, 79, 89)   Although Hartzell \nmanufactured  the turbochargers  and wa s responsible for them, in these factual background \nsections , the SAC also avers that  Continental \u201cspecified and procured\u201d the turbochargers  or was \nresponsible for their \u201cdesign and procurement.\u201d   (Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 49, 85; see also id . at \u00b6\u00b6 87, 89)   \nMoreover, a t various places  in the SAC, it is alleged that Continental was the \u201ctype certificate \nholder \u201d and the \u201cproduction [certificate] holder \u201d for the aircraft\u2019s engines, and that this meant \nthat Continental :  (1) \u201chad a duty to ensure that the engines were airworthy and safe, and would \nnot suffer a sudden and unforeseen loss of power\u201d ; (2) \u201cwas r esponsible to ensure that the \nengines, including their turbocharging systems, functioned\u201d ; (3) \u201cholds responsibility for \nairworthiness and functionality of the engine assembly, to specifically include its turbocharging \nsystem\u201d ; and (4) bears \u201cultimate resp onsibility for the defects in the turbocharging systems of the \naccident engines[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 81- 82, 86, 88)  \nFurther relevant allegations in the SAC will be discussed in Section II below.  \nB. Procedural Background  \nPlaintiff s filed their original Complaint initiating this case on August 12, 2021.  (D.I. 1)  \nShortly thereafter, Plaintiff s filed a First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d).  (D.I. 9)  United States \n \nrelevant to the accident and, relatedly, to the allegations of liability later found in the Counts of \nthe SAC:  \u201cFactual Background[,]\u201d \u201cBackground of the Accident Aircraft and its Engines\u201d and \u201cAccident Investigation[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 17- 89)  For ease of reference, the Court has and will refer \nto these three sections herein as the \u201cfactual background\u201d sections of the SAC.  Next there is a section titled \u201cDamages\u201d that includes the allegations related to that topic.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 90 -110)  \nAnd thereafter , the various Counts are pleaded:  Counts I -VI against Continental (described \nbelow ) and Counts VII -XII against Hartzell (which plead the same six types of claims against \nHartzell that are pleaded against Continental).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 111- 220) 5 District Judge Maryellen Noreika, to whom this matter is assigned, has referred the case to the \nCourt to hear and resolve all pre-trial matters up to and including expert discovery matters.  (D.I. 28) \nContinental then moved to dismiss the FAC as to it (the \u201cfirst motion to dismiss\u201d) , \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  (D.I. 13)  The Court thereafter  issued a Report and Recommendation \n(the \u201cfirst R&R\u201d)  recommending granting the first motion to dismiss  as to all of the counts \n(Counts I- VI) alleged against Continental .  (D.I. 46)  In doing so, the Court concluded that \nPlaintiffs did not plausibly allege how Continental had either breached a du ty owed to Plaintiffs \nor otherwise made a product with a defect that is said to have proximately caused injury to Plaintiffs .  (Id.)  The Court explained that the FAC never articulated \u201chow \u2014separate and apart \nfrom H artzell\u2019s alleged liability \u2014Continental did anything wrong.\u201d  ( Id.)  The Court \nrecommended that Plaintiffs be given an opportunity to further amend their complaint, in order to attempt to state a claim against Continental; it also ordered that , in the interval, the case \nagainst Continental was stayed.  ( Id.)  Judge Noreika later adopted the first R&R, dismissing \nwithout prejudice the claims against Continental and giving Plaintiffs 14 days to file a further amended complaint against Continental.  (D.I. 47)   \nPlaintiffs filed the SAC on July 25, 2022.  (D.I. 48)  In the SAC, Plaintiffs again allege \nsix claims against Continental:  Count I (Strict Liability); Count II (Negligence); Count III  \n(Breach of Express and Implied Warranty); Count IV (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress); Count V (Wrongful Death) and Count VI (Survival Action).  (D.I. 48)\n3  On August 8, \n \n3  Count IV is brought only on behalf of Plaintiffs Hannah and Sarah Bocker; the \nremaining counts against Continental are brought by all Plaintiffs.  (D.I. 48) 6 2022, Continental filed the instant motion, (D.I. 50 ), which was fully briefed as of September 13, \n2022, (D.I. 55).4 \nII. DISCUSSION    \nWith its  Motion, Continental raises various issues.  For reasons set out below, the Court \nneed not reach them all.  Instead, below, the Court will address only those issues it needs to, in \norder to explain why it recommends that Continental\u2019s Motion be granted .   \nA. Plaintiffs \u2019 Allegations Regarding Continental in Paragraphs 83-85, 89, 114, \n116, 119-21, 124, 132-33, 137, 139-42, 148 of the SAC  \nWith its Motion, Continental first takes issue w ith certain allegations found in paragraphs \n83-85, 89, 114, 116, 119-21, 124, 132-33, 137, 139-42 and 148 of the SAC (the \u201cparagraphs at issue\u201d) .  (D.I. 51 at 5-6 (citing D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 83-85, 89, 114, 116, 119-21, 124, 132-33, 137, 139-\n42, 148))  Some back ground is in order to explain why.   \nAs the Court noted above, ( see supra  pps. 2-3), in the factual background sections of the \nSAC , Plaintiffs allege that it was  malfunction s relating to the turbochargers (which, in turn, had \nbeen incorporated into the engines at some point after the engines were manufactured by Continental) that caused the crash.\n5  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-73, 79, 89)  And as also noted above, ( see \nsupra pps. 3-4),  in th ose same factual background section s of the SAC, the pleading makes it \nvery clear that it was Hartzell\u2014not Continental \u2014that  manufactured these turbochargers and that \nwas \u201cresponsible\u201d for the m in that sense.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6  47, 49, 79, 89)  So when reading these \nportions of the SAC, the reader would understand that:  (1) Continental manufactured the \n \n4  Hartzell has filed an answer to the SAC.  (D.I. 49)   \n5  When the Court refers to \u201cturbochargers\u201d herein, it means t o refer to the \nturbochargers and their related components, such as wastegates.  ( See, e.g., D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 69-\n70) 7 engines; (2) Hartzell manufactured the turbochargers; (3) sometime after Continental \nmanufactured the engines, Hartzell\u2019s turbochargers were incorporated  into Continental\u2019s engines ; \n(4) sometime after that, the engines (including the turbochargers) were installed on the aircraft ; \nand (5) on the date of the accident, the turbochargers malfunctioned and caused the crash.6   \nHowever, Continental notes that in the paragraphs at issue ( many  of which are found in \nthe body of Counts I-III against Continental) , Plaintiffs make allegations that appear to contradict \nall of the above.  (D.I. 51 at 7)  In the paragraphs at issue , Plaintiffs assert , inter alia , that it is \nContinental  that \u201cdesigne[d] \u201d and /or \u201cmanufacture [d]\u201d and/or \u201cremanufactured\u201d and/or \n\u201cconstruct[ed]\u201d and/or \u201coverhauled\u201d and/or \u201crebuilt\u201d and/or \u201ctest[ed]\u201d and /or \u201cs[old]\u201d and /or \n\u201cdistribute[d]\u201d and/or \u201cprocure[d]\u201d and/or \u201csupplied\u201d and/or \u201cprovided\u201d and/or \u201cselect[ed] \nappropriate materials for\u201d and/or provided \u201cproduct support\u201d for and/or \u201cdescribed and advertised\u201d and/or \u201cprovide[d] instructions\u201d or \u201cexpress warrant[ies]\u201d and the like for the turbochargers.  ( D.I. 48 at \u00b6 \u00b6 83-85, 89, 114, 116, 119-21, 124, 132-33, 137, 139-42, 148)  In \nother words, whereas the factual background sections of the SAC had clearly alleged that Hartzell is the company that made, or sold, or otherwise sent the turbochargers at issue out into \ncommerce, the paragraphs at issue muddy those waters by suggesting that Continental  may have \ndone this instead. \n \n6  In its briefing, Continental states that:  (1) it manufactured the two accident \nengines in Iowa in early 2008; (2) it shipped the engines to a customer in Iowa in 2008; (3) the \nturbochargers were  installed on the engines after the engines left Continental\u2019s plant in Mobile, \nAlabama; and (4) Continental had no subsequent contact with the engines until after the crash.  (D.I. 51 at 6)  It asserts that Plaintiffs have \u201cknown [these facts] for many months\u201d in light of discovery produced in this case and in a related litigation in New York state court.  ( Id.)  Because \nthese more specific details ( e.g., about the dates of manufacture, or the location of Continental\u2019s \nplant) are not in the SAC, the Court cannot consider them here (nor does it need to) in resolving the Motion.  In this Report and Recommendation, the Court will focus only on what is alleged in the SAC.  8 But things get more confusing from there.  As Continental notes, (D.I. 51 at 7), t he \nallegations in the paragraphs at issue (to the effect that Continental  made/sold, etc., the \nturbochargers) are not only contradicted by what was earlier alleged in the SAC\u2019s factual \nbackground sections.  They are also contradicted by the allegations in the portion of the SAC that includes the counts brought against Hartzell (i.e., Counts VII- XII).  In those Counts, P laintiffs \nassert repeatedly that it is Hartzell  that \u201cdesigne[d]\u201d and/or \u201cmanufacture[d]\u201d and/or \n\u201cconstruct[ed]\u201d and/or \u201coverhauled\u201d and/or \u201crebuil[t] \u201d and/or \u201ctest[ed]\u201d and/or \u201cs[old]\u201d and/or \n\u201cdistribute[d]\u201d and/or \u201cprocure[d]\u201d and/or \u201csuppl[ ied]\u201d and/or \u201cprovided\u201d and/or \u201cselect[ed] \nappropriate materials for\u201d and/or provided \u201cproduct support\u201d for and/or \u201cdescribed and advertised\u201d and/or \u201cprovide[d] instructions\u201d or \u201cexpress war rant[ies]\u201d and  the like for the \nturbochargers at issue.  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 167-68, 172-73, 186-87, 191, 193)  And the allegations in Counts VII- XII reiterate that it is \u201cdefendant Hartzell  [that] is the entity responsible for the \naccident aircraft\u2019s turbochar gers and component parts\u201d and it was Hartzell  (or its predecessor \ncompanies) that \u201coriginally sold\u201d and \u201cplaced [the turbochargers] into the stream of commerce[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 169, 178 (emphasis added)) \nIn light of all of this , Continental argues that the allegations in the paragraphs at issue \nshould be stricken from the SAC pursuant to Rule 12(f).\n7  It asserts that this is so because the \nallegations therein (suggesting that Continental made, or designed, or sold, or originated in any \n \n7  Rule 12(f) states, in relevant part, that a \u201ccourt may strike from a pleading an \ninsufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(f).  \u201c[T]he purpose of a motion to strike is to clean up the pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary forays into immaterial matters.\u201d  Sepracor Inc. v. Dey, L.P ., \nCivil Action No. 06-113-JJF, 2008 WL 4377570, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 26, 2008) (inter nal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Motions to strike are generally disfavored and \u201cusually will be denied unless the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy and may cause prejudice to one of the parties.\u201d  Id . (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  9 way the turbochargers) are \u201cdemonstrably false, misleading and prejudicial [,]\u201d (D.I. 51 at 4), and \nresult in a SAC that includes \u201cdozens of compound, grammatically tortuous, and borderline \nincomprehensible[8] allegations\u201d  against it,  (id. at 8).  \nThe Court is not certain that striking this material from the SAC is the appropriate way to \ngo here.9  But it need not resolve this Rule 12(f) issue, because the allegations in these \nparagraphs are wanting for another reason:  they are simply not plausible .10  Put differently, in \n \n8  As Continental notes, there are also a number of typographical errors in the SAC \nthat at times make it difficult to read.  (D.I. 51 at 8 & n.2) \n9  The content of the paragraphs at issue is  not exactly \u201c redundant, immaterial, \nimpertinent, or scandalous matter \u201d\u2014i.e., the kind of material that courts typically strike pursuant \nto Rule 12(f).  They are not \u201credundant\u201d matter in th e sense that they do not amount to \u201cneedless \nrepetition\u201d of the same allegation against the same party (instead, they are allegations about one \nparty that are also sometimes made against another party).  Sliger v. Prospect Mortg., LLC , 789 \nF. Supp. 2d 1212, 1216 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  They \nare not \u201cimmaterial\u201d matter because they do have an \u201cessential or important relationship to the claim[s]\u201d at issue.   Del . Health Care, Inc. v. MCD Holding Co., 893 F.

And  they are not \u201cscandalous\u201d matter because they do bear a \u201cpossible relation \nto the controversy[.]\u201d  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nIndeed, the real reason Continental is seeking to strike these allegations is that it believes \nthey a re just simply \u201cfalse\u201d (and , relatedly,  confusing).  (D.I. 51 at 4; D.I. 55 at 5)  But courts do \nnot typically strike material pursuant to Rule 12(f) because one side thinks that the allegations against them are false.  See Fox v. Lackawanna Cnty ., NO. 3:16- CV-1511, 2017 WL 5007905, at \n*12 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 2, 2017); River Road Dev. Corp. v. Carlson Corp.\u2014 Ne., CIV. A. No. 89-\n7037, 1990 WL 69085, at *7 (E.D. Pa.

The sufficiency of pleadings for non-fraud cases is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  In order to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plau sible on its face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  In assessing such a motion, the court first separates the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the complaint\u2019s well -pleaded facts as true, \nbut [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 10 light of the fact that the SAC repeatedly alleges in its factual background section s that Hartzell  is \nthe entity that manufactured and originated the turbochargers at issue  (and then alleges that again \nin the Counts against Hartzell), then it simply is not plausible to believe  the contrary allegations \nin the paragraphs at issue (to the effect that instead it was  Continental  who took those actions).  \nWhere a plaintiff\u2019s own pleading is internally inconsistent and contradictory, the court is not \nobligated to reconcile or accept such contradictory allegations.11  Thus, the Court will not credit \n \n(3d Cir. 2009).  Second, the court determines \u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are \nsufficient to show that the plaintiff has a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id.  at 211 (quoting \nAshcroft , 556 U.S. at 679). \n11  See Mora v.

But this allegation is \ncontradicted by the other facts alleged in the complaint, making the claim implausible on its face.\u201d); Carson Optical Inc. v. eBay Inc., 202 F. Supp. 3d 247, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (noting that \u201ca court is neither  obligated to reconcile nor accept the contradictory allegations in the pleadings \nas true\u201d when the allegations \u201care internally inconsistent\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Dougherty v. Blize , C.A. No. 07-674- SLR-LPS, 2008 WL 2543430, at *5 (D. Del. June \n25, 2008) (same), adopted in part by  2008 WL 7278920 (D. Del. Oct. 7, 2008); cf. Jaroslawicz v. \nM&T Bank Corp., 296 F.

But here, the Court does not read the SAC a s actually attempting to plead in the \nalternative that both Continental and Hartzell made, sold and/or otherwise originated the turbochargers.  Instead, it understands the SAC to allege (particularly in light of the allegations in its factual background sections, quoted above) that Hartzell  took these steps.  Indeed, it \nappears that  the confusing and contradictory allegations in the paragraphs at issue (i.e., to the \neffect that Continental  did so instead) could essentially be mistakes  and/or the result of \ndisorde red pleading.  Cf.  Montoya v. City of Chicago, 21 C 4596, 2022 WL 523105, at *1 (N.D. \nIll. Feb. 22, 2022) (noting that while a plaintiff may plead in the alternative, the complaint\u2019s conflicting allegations rendered it impossible to discern what the plaintiff was alleging , and \ndismissing the claim for failure to give the defendant fair notice of the facts on which the claim rests) ; Seagraves, Whiteface & Lubbock R.R.  Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., No. \n93 C 1442, 1993 WL 524263, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 10, 1993) (\u201cWhile pleading in the alternative is appropriate, and often necessary, Count V is needlessly confusing and must be dismissed.\u201d).   11 any of the allegations in the paragraphs at issue suggesting that Continental made, sold or took \nsome other originating step with regard to the turbochargers on the aircraft.   \nBefore leaving this topic, the Court notes  one last factor , which also  suggests that its \nconclusion here is the correct one .  That is that, in their answering brief, Plaintiffs make no \nattempt to  defend the allegations in the paragraphs at issue .  In fact, w ith the exception of one \nsentence\u2014 a sentence in which Plaintiffs aver in a conclusory fashion that  the allegations \n\u201cContinental seeks to strike are  wholly relevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims,\u201d (D.I. 54 at 6) \u2014Plaintiffs \nsimply ignore d Continental\u2019s Rule 12(f) argument , (D.I. 55 at 6) .  In other words, i n the ir \nanswering brief, Plaintiffs never  suggest that they do think that the SAC  plausibly suggest s that \nContinental  made or  sold or otherwise originated the turbochargers at issue.  Nor  do Plaintiffs \nargue  that this is what they actually intended to allege  in the SAC.  Instead, in their answering \nbrief, Plaintiffs suggest a different rationale for why the SAC\u2019s allegations against Continental \ncould survive.  And so t he Court will take up that rationale below.  \nB. Plaintiffs\u2019 Other Allegations Regarding Continental\u2019s Liability  \nIn the SAC, Plaintiffs a llege that Continental was the \u201ctype certificate holder\u201d and \n\u201cproduction certificate holder\u201d for the engines  on the aircraft .  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 81- 82)  Plaintiffs \nthen assert that Continental \u201chad a duty to ensure that the engines were airworthy and safe, and would not suffer a sudden and unforeseen loss of power \u201d and they claim that this i ncluded the \nduty to ensure that the engines\u2019 \u201cturbocharging systems [] functioned\u201d  properly.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 81- 82)  \nThe SAC states that , as a result, Continental bears \u201cultimate responsibility for the defects in the \nturbocharging systems of the accident engines\u201d  that caused the crash.   (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88; see also \nid. at \u00b6\u00b6 113- 15) 12 These allegations  must be the ones that Plaintiffs think are key to Continental\u2019s liability  \nhere.  That is because they are the only allegations that  Plaintiffs pointed to in the Argument \nsection of their answering brief , when Plaintiffs were attempting to explain why their claims \nagainst Continental were actually plausible.  (D.I. 54 at 6 (Plaintiffs asserting that the \u201cSAC \nspecifies the responsibilities, and breaches thereof, Continental committed in relation to its role as Type Certificate Holder and Production Certificate Holder, responsible for the engine, and the engine accessories\u201d) ; id. at 8 (Plaintiffs arguing that \u201c[t]here is no doubt, even on the face of \nPlaintiffs\u2019 SAC, that Continental is the entity who is the type certificate holder and responsible for the airworthiness of the engines\u201d) (citing D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 81-89))\n12   \n These allegations, however, do not plausibly explain how Continental could be liable, \npursuant to Counts I- VI, for a crash  caused by the turbochargers\u2014a product that Continental did \nnot make, or sell, or place into commerce in any way.  For one thing, the SAC never explains what it means to be a \u201ctype certificate holder\u201d or a \u201cproduction certificate holder\u201d with regard to an engine found in an aircraft.  (D.I. 51 at 11 (Continental referring to this language as \u201cmurky verbiage\u201d))  Relatedly , the pleading never further articulates why, if the turbochargers at issue \n \n12  The Court also notes that at times, the SAC asserts that Continental \u201cspecified \u201d \nand/or \u201cprocure [d]\u201d and/or \u201cdesign[ed]\u201d the turbochargers and, \u201c[a]s such, the flaws\u201d that caused \nthe accident \u201cwere the ultimate responsibility\u201d of Continental.  ( D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6  49-50, 85, 87, 89)  \nPlaintiffs do not reference these allegations in their answering brief, and so it appears that \nPlaintiffs do not believe that they are material to assessing whether plausible claims against Continental have been set out.  Moreover, as to the \u201cspecified\u201d allegation, it is unclear  from the \nSAC :  (1) in what way Continental \u201cspecified\u201d the turbochargers; (2) what it even means to \n\u201cspecify\u201d a product like this ; and (3) how any such \u201cspecification\u201d helps demonstrate why \nContinental owed a duty relating to the turbochargers.  (D.I. 55 at 5)  As for the \u201c procure [d]\u201d and \n\u201cdesign[ed]\u201d allegation s, they appear to be contradicted by other allegations in the SAC, which \nstate it was Hartzell who made the turbochargers and \u201cdesign[ ed]\u201d them .  (See., e.g ., D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6  \n170-71)  Therefore, these \u201cspecified\u201d and/or  \u201cprocure[d]\u201d and/or \u201cdesign[ed]\u201d allegations in the \nSAC  are confusing and implausible, and so the Court will not further consider them here.  13 were \u201cincorporate[ed]\u201d into Continental\u2019s engines after Continental ma nufactured  the engines, \nContinental would nevertheless have a legal duty or responsibility to ensure that those \nturbochargers \u201cfunctioned\u201d properly.  (D.I. 48 at \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, 89)  What is it that Continental did \nthat gave rise to this duty with regard to the turbochargers?  Did Continental sign some type of contract taking on such liability?  If the fact that Continental holds th e above- referenced \n\u201ccertificates\u201d has something to do with taking on such a duty, why or how is that so?  The SAC never says .  Instead it leaves t he reader to guess at why Continental is being sued.  (D.I. 55 at 3)  \nSuch allegations do not set out a plausible claim for liability as to Continental regarding Counts I-VI.\n13  \nC. Conclusion and Nature of Dismissal \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court recommends that the Motion be granted and that the \nclaims against Continental in Counts I -VI be dismissed.14   \n \n13  The claims in Counts I- VI are all different  claims  with different elements , of \ncourse.  And the parties disagre e about which state\u2019s law applies to th ose claims  (with Plaintiffs \npreferring New York  law and Continental preferring Delaware law).   (D.I. 54 at 11; D.I. 55 at 7)  \nBut no matter which state\u2019s law applies,  as to each of the claims, there would at least need to be \nsome plausible basis to believe that Continental took an action that rendered it responsible for the \naircraft\u2019s  turbochargers having malfunctioned (i.e., that Continental improperly designed or \nmanufactured that  product, or that Continental somehow had a duty with regard to the product, \nor that Continental made a representation about the product ).  See, e.g. , Flores v. Youm , 133 \nN.Y.S.3d 786 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2020);  Barclay v. Techno-Design, Inc ., 129 A.D.3d 1177, 1178-79 \n(N.Y. App. Div. 2015); Fitzpatrick v. Currie , 52 A.D.3d 1089, 1090 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008) ; \nSchultes v. Kane , 50 A.D.3d 1277, 1278 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008); Earsing v. Nelson, 212 A.D.2d \n66, 70 (N.Y. App. Div. 1995) ; see also  Del. C ode tit. 10, \u00a7 3701; Del. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 3724; Smith \nv. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 201 A.3d 555, 572 n.110 (Del. Super. Ct. 2019);  Abbate v. Werner Co ., \nC.A. No. 09C-02-013 WLW, 2012 WL 1413524, at *1-2 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 19, 2012); White v. APP Pharms., L LC, C.A. No. N10C-04-061-CLS, 2011 WL 2176151, at *2-3 (Del. Super. Ct. \nApr. 7, 2011).  The SAC lacks allegations to plausibly establish any of this, which is relevant to all six of the Counts against Continental.    \n14  With its Motion, Continental also sought:  (1) to have Counts I, III, V and VI \nagainst it dismissed on other grounds; and (2) to have the entire Complaint against it dismissed pursuant to the Colorado River  abstention doctrine and/or the Court\u2019s inherent authority.  (D.I. 14 In their answering brief, Plaintiffs requested that if the Motion was to be granted, that \nthey be permitted to further amend the SAC to attempt to state a claim against Continental, \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2).  (D.I . 54 at 12)  That is a tough call for the \nCourt.  O n the one hand, the SAC is t he third complaint Plaintiffs have filed , and this is the \nsecond instance in which the Court has found Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against Continental to be wanting.  And Plaintiffs have had quite a long time since this case was initiated to  muster a \nplausible claim against this Defendant.  On the other hand, the Court is always mindful that leave to amend should be given freel y \u201cwhen justice so requires[.]\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  And it is \ndifficult to say that it would be impossible for Plaintiffs to make out a claim against Continental \u2014were Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations simply more robust, focused and coherent.  In light of \nall of this, the Court recommends that Plaintiffs not be permitted to further amend their \ncomplaint against Continental unconditionally.  Instead, it recommends that if the District Court \naffirms this Report and Recommendation, and Plaintiffs wish to attempt to  further amend, that \nthey first be required to file a motion for leave to amend (one that attaches the proposed amended \npleading) , see Fletcher -Harlee Corp. v. Pote Concrete Contractors, Inc., 482 F.3d 247, 252 (3d \nCir. 2007) , within 14 days of the District Court\u2019s order.  \nIV. CONCLUSION For all of the above reasons , the Court recommends tha t the Motion be GRANTED and \nthat Counts I -VI against Continental be DISMISSED .   \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections \n \n51 at 12- 20)  Because the Court is recommending dismissal of the claims against Continental on \nthe previously- referenced grounds, it need not address these issues.  15 within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district court.  See Sincavage v. Barnhart , 171 F. App\u2019x \n924, 925 n.1 (3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson , 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).   \nThe parties ar e directed to the Court\u2019s Standing Order for Objections Filed Under Fed.
