BURKE, United States Magistrate Judge   \n As announced at the hearing on July 8, 2022, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant \nTVision Insights, Inc. \u2019s (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cTVision \u201d) motion to dismiss  (the \u201cmotion\u201d) , (D.I. 11 ), \nwhich argues that Plaintiff\u2019s The Nielsen Co. (US), LLC \u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff \u201d) asserted United States \nPatent No. 9,020,189 is directed to non- patent -eligible subject matter pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n101 (\u201cSection 101\u201d) is DENIED.  \n Defendant\u2019s motion was fully briefed as of March 1, 2022, (D.I. 18), and the Court \nreceived further submissions regarding Section  101- related questions on July 1, 2022, (D.I. 42; \nD.I. 4 3).  The Court carefully revi ewed all submission s in connection with Defendant\u2019s motion , \nheard oral argument, and applied the relevant legal standar ds for review of this type of Section \n101-related motion at the pleading stage, which it has previously set out in Genedics, LLC v. Meta Co., Civil Action No. 17-1062-CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2-5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).    The Court\u2019s Order is consistent with the bench ruling announced at the hearing on July 8, 2022,\n1 pertinent excerpts of which follow:  \nI[ will]  now move on to the third case, [T]he Nielsen Co [.] (US), \nLLC, v [.] TVision  Insights, Inc., Civil Action Number 21-1592-\nCJB.  In this consent case, we have Defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion.  The motion as it relates to Section 101 is denied for the reasons I will set out now.    Plaintiff asserts in its complaint that Defendant infringes at least claim 9 of U .S. Patent Number 9,020,189 which I[ wil l] refer to as  \nthe '189 patent.  The patent is entitled  \u201cMethods and Apparatus to \nMonitor Environments.\u201d  Generally, claim 9 recites an  audience \nmeasurement device comprised of a first data analyzer, a second data analyzer,  and a counter.\n2  These limitations will be  \ndiscussed in further detail in a moment.  \n \n1  ( See D.I. 4 5) \n \n2  ('189 patent, col. 23:23-37)  \n3 \n Plaintiff \u2019s complaint also alleged  infringement of a second patent, \nand Defendant \u2019s motion was also directed to that  patent, but \nPlaintiff subsequently filed a  notice of partial dismissal of that \ninfringement claim.3  Defendant \u2019s motion is now  moot regarding \nthat patent,4 so the Court \u2019s analysis here focuses only on the '189 \npatent.  \n \nFirst, on the issue of representative  claims, Defendant says that \nclaim 9 of the '189 patent is representative.5  Plaintiff did [ not]  \nchallenge that claim 9 is representative, and  the Court will analyze \nonly claim 9 [;] because the Court will deny the motion with \nrespect to claim 9, the Court will, therefore, deny it with respect to all other asserted  claims or potentially asserted claims of the  '189 \npatent.  \n I will now turn to the Alice  analysis at  step one.  The first question \nis, what is the  abstract idea that Defendant contends that this  claim \nis directed to?   In this r egard, I will  say that this case provides a \ngreat example of  how a defendant who argues a Section 101 \nmotion  will get into trouble by being less than clear  about what the \npurported abstract idea actually  is. \n In its opening brief, Defendant was a bit  vague  as to that question. \nMore specifically,  on page 13 of its opening brief, Defendant made  \nreference to claim 9 and then stated, citing to the complaint, \u201c As \nNielsen admits, the patent relates to \u2018 capturing images in the area \nin front of a television and ana lyzing those  images to determine the \nnumber of people  present. \u2019\u201d\n6  The Court will refer to this as the  \n\u201cfirst version of the abstract idea. \u201d  So at  first, the Court thought, \n[\u201cO]kay.  That [ is] the  abstract idea that Defendant is saying the \nclaim is directed to. [\u201d]  But then in the next  sentence of its brief, \nDefendant states that  \u201c[c]laim 9 is directed to  [(1)]  detecting an  \nobject within a threshold range using a 3 -D method; [(2)], \ndetecting a different object  outside a threshold range with a 2- D \nmethod;  and [(3)] counting the total number of people  detected. \u201d7  \nThat is a much l onger, more  specific articulation of what the \n \n3  (D.I. 38)  \n \n4  (D.I. 39)  \n \n5  (D.I. 12 at 17)  \n \n6  (Id. at 13)  \n \n7  (Id.) 4 \n abstract idea at issue supposedly is.  The Court will refer  to this as  \nthe \u201c second version of the abstract  idea. \u201d  Perhaps, thought the \nCourt, this  instead is what Defendant was pointing to as  the \nabstract idea.    \n \nBut the Court was still a little unclear,  and so, apparently, was \nPlaintiff.  In its  answering brief, Plaintiff thought that the  abstract \nidea was the first version of the  abstr act idea, and on page 15 and \n16 of its  brief, it addressed that version and explained why claim 9 \nwas not directed [t]o it.8  Then in Defendant \u2019s reply brief, things \ngot even murkier.  There, on page seven, Defendant  stated that  \n\u201cTVision \u2019s motion in fact further specifies the abstract idea at issue \nto be detecting people using two different, specific  methods and \nthen counting them.\u201d9  That is yet  another, different articulation, \nand I will  refer to that articulation herein as the \u201cthird  version of \nthe abstract idea. \u201d \n \nLastly, today, in slide two of its  presentation, Defendant at first \nseemed to be going back to using the second version of the  \nabstract idea, the one that uses words like  \u201c3-D method\u201d  and \u201c 2-D \nmethod.\u201d    This lack of clarity matters.  A s the Court has noted previously, in \ncases like Yodlee, Inc., v. Plaid Tech[s.] , Inc. , a \u201cmovant \u2019s \n[in]ability to clearly and uniformly  articulate the asserted abstract \nidea in  question can make the Alice  analysis difficult for the Court, \nand there are times when it can  suggest weakness in the movant \u2019s \noverall  position.\u201d\n10  In the Alice  analysis, after all,  the Court needs \nto understand exactly what the  asserted abstract idea is, and that [ \nis] because at step one, the Court has to determine whether  the \nclaim is directed to that idea or something  different and more \nspecific.  And it needs to understand what the purported abstract idea is at step two so that it can determine what more  is in the \nclaim [] beyond that idea and analyze  whether that something mor e \namounts to the  inventive concept.  \n Today, the Court will largely focus on the third version of the abstract idea, that  one that Defendant, in its final brief, assured  \n \n8  (D.I. 16 at 15- 16) \n \n9  (D.I. 18 at 7)  \n \n10  Yodlee, Inc. v. Plaid Techs., Inc ., Civil Action No. 14- 1445- LPS, 2016 WL \n2982503, at *28 n.37 (D. Del. May 23, 2016).  5 \n the Court that it was putting forward, and the  one that by the end of \noral argument today Defendant \u2019s counsel posited as the most  \nappropriate formulation.11  Again, that is  \u201cdetecting people using \ntwo different, specific  methods and then counting them.\u201d  \n \nIs \u201cdetecting people using two different, specific methods and then \ncounting them \u201d an abstract idea?  The Court will assume that it is  \nfor the purposes of its analysis here  (though the reference to the \nuse of two different, specific methods  for detection sure  does start \nto sound a lot like it could amount  to a real -world application of an \nidea, not the  idea itself).  The Court will thus proceed to assess \nwhether claim 9 is actually directed to  this idea.  \n Plaintiff, for its part, argues that claim 9 is not.  Instead, it argues that the  claim provides a technological solution to the  \ntechnological problems in the prior art.\n12 \n For the reasons discussed herein, the  Court finds that Defendant \u2019s \nversion of the  abstract idea, its third version,  oversimplifies what \nclaim 9 is directed to.  In cases like CardioNet, LLC, v . InfoBionic, \nInc., the [United States Court of Appeals for the] Federal Circuit \nhas instructed [c]ourts to be  \u201ccareful to avoid oversimplifying [the \nclaims] b y looking at [ them] generally and failing to account for [] \nspecific requirements [.]\u201d\n13  Yet that [ is] what [D] efendant has done \nhere, at least as  to this version of the abstract idea.  Why does  the \nCourt say this?  \n To answer that question, the Court turns  to the patent specification, \nwhich sheds light  on the \u201c directed to \u201d step one inquiry and bolsters  \nthe Court \u2019s conclusion.  The  Background section in column 1 \nexplains that  audience measurement systems collect people data  \nthat can be combined with media  identifying data in order to \ngenerate data indicative of the amounts and/or types of  people  \npeople that are exposed to specific pieces of media.\n14  Or, to put it \nmore colloquially, to help figure out how many people are watching a  given [television] program at any given time. \n \n \n11  (D.I. 45 at 96)  \n \n12  (D.I. 16 at 15)  \n \n13  CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 955 F.3d 1358, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2020)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) . \n \n14  ('189 patent, col. 1:12- 24) 6 \n And the Detailed Description section of  the patent goes on to \nexplain in columns 1 and 2 how prior art audience measurement \nsystems maintained a tally for each frame of image data that  \nreflects an amount of people in the  environment at that time.15 \nHowever, the  specification explains, sometimes these systems  \ncan provide inaccurate tallies of people, such as, for example,  [(1)]  \nmistaking a nonhuman object for a human face; or, [(2)] by failing \nto detect human faces due to poor lighting conditions or partial \nvisibility or other  similar issues; or,  [(3)] by failing to \nrecognize human faces due to field -of-view  limitations associated \nwith image sensors.16 \n \nPlaintiff \u2019s complaint also attaches the  declaration of Virginia \nLee,17 which I [ will]  hereafter refer to as the Lee [D]eclaration.   \nI\u2019ll note for the record that while I [ will]  be focused on the \nspecification [and]  claim 9 in  determining what the claim is \ndirected to, I am  simply referencing the Lee [D] eclaration because \nit underscores what is in the patent.  Paragraph 19 of that declaration notes that the  most common approach before the '189 \npatent  came along employed the use of two -dimensional  data \nanalysis using . . . a  camera . . . that captured a two -dimensional  \nimage.\n18  But that led to some of the problems  just described, such \nas that two -dimensional  sensors would tend to overcount people \nbecause,  for example, they misinterpreted images of  pictures of \npeople hanging on the wall and identified them as actual human beings who were  present in the room.  Or they failed to pick up \nreal people in the room due to some of the  lighting and visibility \nproblems I just  mentioned. \n Columns 3 and 4 of the specification, as  well as paragraph 20 of \nthe Lee [D] eclaration,  explain that other systems tr [ied] to address \nthese problems by using three -dimensional data.\n19  This  improved \nrecognition systems as compared to those that previously relied \nsolely on two -dimensional data [,] in the sense that  capturing and \nprocessing three -dimensional data  improved the ability to \ndistinguish actual  human faces from face -like patterns in  paintings  \n \n15  (Id., cols. 1:63- 2:3, 2:27- 30) \n \n16  (Id., col. 2: 36-50) \n \n17  (D.I. 1, ex. B)  \n \n18  (Id. at \u00b6 19)  \n \n19  ('189 patent, col s. 3:10- 4:25; D.I. 1, ex. B  at \u00b6 20)  7 \n or pictures.  And it allowed for more  accurate identification of \nbody parts or  skeletal frameworks of a real person.  Yet  these \nsources also explain [] that the use of  three -dimensional data alone \nhad its downsides  too.  In certain instances, for example, suc h as if \nthe people are outside a threshold distance from the three -\ndimensional sensor, the  sensor would have difficulty in identifying \nthe people.20 \n \nThen, at column 4 of the specification, the patent tells us what is the claimed advance over the prior art.  In lines 1 through 10, the  \npatent states that:  \u201c [E]xamples disclosed herein  recognize that in \ncertain instances  [(e.g.], when a subject object is greater than  \na threshold distance away from a sensor [)], a  2D-based recognition \nanalysis  may be better  suited [ (e.g.],  may provide more accurate \nresults [)] for object recognition than a 3D -based  recognition \nanalys [e]s.  The advantages of  2D-based recognition analyses over \nthe 3D -based  recognition analyses are especially significant  for [] \nrelatively thin objects [ (e.g.], arms, hands, et [c.)] at relatively far  \ndistances from the corresponding sensor.\u201d\n21  And  lines 26 to 30 at \nthat column state that the  invention disclosed in the patent \n\u201cutilize [s] three -dimensional recognition analysis and two -\ndimensional analysis to more accurately and more efficiently recognize objects in an  environment than previous recognition \nsystems. \u201d\n22  Paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Lee [D]eclaration  also \nfurther emphasize that this innovation  provided a \u201c much more \u201d \naccurate count of people present in the area of a television as \ncompared  to prior systems, which amounted to an improvement \nover prior art approaches.23 \n Again, the Federal Circuit has told us  that at step one, it is \npermissible to look to  the specificati on to determine what the \nclaims  are directed to, and if the specification  describes something \nas the innovation over the  prior art, then it stands to reason that the  \nclaim is probably directed to that element or  concept.\n24  Here,   \nwhen you consider what columns  3 and 4 of the specification are \ntelling us,  it[ is] clear that the innovation over the prior  art is not \n \n20  ('189 patent, col. 3: 32-49)  \n \n21  (Id., col. 4:1- 10) \n \n22  (Id., col. 4:26- 30) \n \n23  (D.I. 1, ex. B at \u00b6\u00b6 21- 22) \n \n24  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  8 \n simply said to be \u201c detecting people using two different, specific \nmethods and then counting them.\u201d   \u201cTwo different, specific  \nmethods \u201d is vague.  It could refer to any  two such methods.  Here, \nin contrast, the patent is  focused on a method that utilizes a  \nthree- dimensional sensor to obtain data on a  first object, but only if \nthe object is within  a threshold distance from the sensor [,] and \nusing a two -dimensional sensor to obtain data on a  second object [,] \nbut only if the object is outside  of that threshold distance from the \nsensor.  In other words, the third version of the abstract  idea simply \ndoes[ not]  capture the use of both a  2D and 3D sensor, nor does it \ncapture the concept that those sensors should be working to capture \ndata objects that are located at  different distance [s] away from the \nrespective sensors.  \n \nOf course, no matter what the  specification tells us, []claim [s] \nclaim, and  a step one analysis must look to the claims in  the \n\u201cdirected to \u201d analysis.  But  unsurprisingly, claim 9 clearly recites \nan audience measurement device that incorporates  these assertedly \ninnovative elements.25  The claim first uses a three- dimensional \nsensor at  close range, which eliminates problems with the  two-\ndimensional [-]only approach[,] such as  overcounting by mistaking \nobjects for people  and accurately counting people in poor lighting  \nconditions; second, it uses a two- dimensional  sensor at long range, \nwhich eliminates the  problem of inaccuracy of the three-\ndimensional [-]only approach in that range; and, third, it  combines \nthe results of the two approaches to arrive at an accurate people \ncount.  Thus, the  invention in claim 9 utilizes tw o known \napproaches that had drawbacks when they were used individually, but combines them to get the  best of both together.  And as \nDefendant \u2019s opening brief recognizes, the other claims of  the '189 \npatent similarly involve these same  elements.\n26 \n So, agai n, characterizing claim 9 as  being directed to \u201c detecting \npeople using two different, specific methods and then counting them\u201d ignores the thrust of the invention.  The  claim clearly is [ \nnot] just about using \u201c two different methods \u201d to monitor people or \nan environment.  It is about doing so in a particular  way, using \ntwo-dimensional and three -dimensional sensors set up to capture  \ndata at two different distances.  \n As the Court said previously in opinions  like Sunoco Partners \nMarketing  & Terminals L.P. [v .] Powder Spring Logistics, LLC , it \n \n25  ('189 patent, col. 23:22- 37) \n \n26  (D.I. 12 at 13)  \n 9 \n is Defendant \u2019s burden to articulate an abstract  idea that correctly \ncharacterizes the claim at  issue.27  Defendant has failed to do so \nhere as  it relates to the third version of the abstract  idea, and that \nalone is a sufficient basis to  deny the Section 101 portion of its \nmotion.  \n \nIn an abundance of caution, let me also  briefly address Defendant \u2019s \nsecond version of  the abstract idea [:]  that was \u201c [(1)] detecting an  \nobject within a threshold range using a 3 -D method; [(2)] detecting \na different object  outside a threshold range with a 2- D method;  and  \n[(3)] counting the total number of people  detected. \u201d  To be sure, \nunlike the third version of the abstract idea, this version includes all of the mater ial claim limitations  that the Court has been \ndiscussing.  It would have to, because it [ is] basically a restatement  \nof claim 9, using almost every key word in the claim.  But if Defendant is asserting that the  claim is directed to this abstract \nidea, then  its motion still fails at step one for a  different reason: \nThe second version of  abstract idea is not actually an abstract idea  \nat all.  It [ is] far too specific to be simply an idea \u201c untethered from \na real -world  application,\u201d  and instead it is an application of an idea \nthat is meant to solve a  technological problem, as described \npreviously.  Although the Court could stop there, for  the sake of completeness, \nit will make a few  other points that also militate in favor of  denial \nof Defendant \u2019s motion at step one. \n Defendant argues that claim 9 is abstract  because humans have \nlong practiced the concept  described in claim 9 of locating objects \nby using \u201c two different methods [.]\u201d\n28  It gave as an  example, as \nwas noted in oral argument, a  birdwatcher wanting to count birds  \nwho could first detect birds visible with bare sight, and  then use \nbinoculars to detect birds outside the  threshold distance afforded \nby bare sight, and then combine the two inputs to generate a bird  \ncount.29  But the Court is not persuaded that this analogy exactly \ncaptures the invention recited in claim 9.  For one thing, claim 9 uses, among other things, a three -dimensional  sensor [\u2014]not a \nperson\u2019 s eyesight or pair of  binoculars [\u2014]to count objects.  It is \nnot clear  to the Court that a human could do what a  three -\ndimensional sensor could do.  And  regardless, as a practical matter, \n \n27  Sunoco Partners Mktg. & Terminals L.P. v. Powder Springs Logistics, LLC , Civil \nAction No. 17- 1390- LPS-CJB, 2019 WL 4466766, at *10 (D. Del. Sept. 18, 2019) . \n \n28  (D.I. 12 at 15)   \n \n29  (Id. at 14 -15; D.I. 45 at 94- 95) 10 \n human beings  do not sit consistently for hours or days at a  time \naround a television set in order to count  how many people  are \nwatching.  The entire reason a claim like claim 9 exists is because  \ntechnology is being asked to fill a void that  humans reasonably \ncannot.  \n \nDefendant also argues that the claim is  directed to an abstract idea \nsince it fails to  describe how  the claime d 2-D or 3 -D methods  work \nor what  the thresholds distance should be  or precisely how  the \ncounting functionality works.30  And that [ is] true.  The claim [] \ndo[es not]  specify [ this] , but the claim does  clearly utilize  pieces of \ntechnology that are being used together in a  sufficiently \nparticularized way  that provides a needed level of \u201c how\u201d to the  \ninvention.  And the patent specification describes that very \napproach as providing a  technological improvement over the prior \nart.  Here again, if Defendan t\u2019s main complaint is  that the patent \ndoes[ not] say enough about how  to do the recognition analysis or \nthe combining element, that sounds to the Court more like a  \nSection 112 problem, not a Section 101 problem.31 \n The caselaw that the parties highlight as  similar to claim 9 also \nhelps to demonstrate  this conclusion is correct and that [P ]laintiff \u2019s \nconclusion here is the right one.  For example, the Court strongly agrees with  Plaintiff\n32 that claim 9 is very similar to the  claims that \nare at issue in Thales Visionix  Inc. v [.] United States .33  Claim 22 \nin Thales  was exemplary, and it was brief.  In two lines, it recited a \nmethod of determining an object \u2019s orientation based on the outputs \nof two  inertial sensors that were mounted,  respectively, on the \nobject and a moving refere nce frame.34  This was discussed today \nat oral argument.35  The specification explained how  conventional \nmethods for tracking an object \u2019s motion were flawed and that the \npatent \u2019s invention provided multiple advantages, including \n \n30  (D.I. 12 at 13, 15)   \n \n31  See Visual  Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp., 867 F.3d 1253, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2017). \n \n32  (D.I. 16 at 16; D.I. 43 at 1- 2) \n \n33  Thales Visionix Inc. v. United States , 850 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  \n \n34  Id. at 1345- 46. \n \n35  (D.I. 45 at 98)  \n 11 \n increased accuracy, the ability to operate without requiring \nhardware, and simple  installation.36 \n In finding at step one that the claim and another representative claim were not directed  to the abstract idea of \u201c using laws of \nnature  governing motion to track two objects, \u201d the Federal Circuit \nnoted that instead, the \u201c claims  specify a particular configuration of \ninertial sensors and a particular method of using the  raw data from \nthe sensors in order to more  accurately calculate the position and  \norientation of an objec t on a moving platform.\u201d\n37  Now, the \nFederal Circuit said th [is] even though, like here, claim 22 did[ \nnot] specify how you determine the orientation of the object or \nwhat  processes or formulas you used to do that.  The  claim just \nsaid that you do so \u201c based on\u201d  signals from the respective two \nsensors.  Nor  did the claim say how those sensors worked to \nprovide signals.  And the sensors used in Thales , like here, were \nconventional sensors.38 \n Nevertheless, it was enough for the Federal  Circuit that the \nconfiguration of the sensors  was a \u201cparticular \u201d one or was used in a \n\u201cparticular method \u201d for collecting data.\n39  In other words, \nsufficient particularity was  demonstrated by the fact that the \nsensors were  specified to be placed [in] two different  positions, an \nobject and a moving reference  frame, so long as the patent helped \nmake clear  how that \u201c particular \u201d arrangement solved the  \ntechnological problem.  And contrary to Defendant \u2019s argument, \nhere it seems like we[ have]  about  just that same level of  \nparticularity [\u2014]two sensors, one is 3- D that [ is] within a threshold \ndistance of an object, one  is a 2 -D that [ is] outside the threshold \ndistance from the object, and a similar explanation in  the patent \nabout how this set -up could help s olve some problems in audience \nmeasurement  technology. \n Although Defendant retorts that the '189 patent does [ not]  suggest \nthat the sensor  configuration is unconventional,\n40 that[ is] exactly  \n \n36  Thales , 850 F.3d at 1345.  \n \n37  Id. at 1346, 1349.  \n \n38  Id. at 1344- 45.   \n \n39  Id.at 1349.  \n \n40  (D.I. 18 at 9)  \n 12 \n what column 4 does seem to be saying, as I [ have]  discussed \npreviously.  In its briefing,  Defendant tries to further distinguish \nThales  by saying that its sensor configuration was  \u201cdriven by \nnavigational equations.\u201d41  While it[  is] true that the Thales  Court \nsaid that the patent  used \u201cnavigation equations \u201d and \u201c mathematical  \nequations \u201d derived from the arrangement of  sensors,42 it[ is] not \nlike the claims in Thales  claimed any particular equations or any \nway of  using the data from the sensors.  Here, the Court cannot say \nthat the math utilized by our  sensors is any more or less claimed or \nany more  or less complicated than what was used in  Thales . \n \nDefendant, for its part,43 analogizes claim  9 of the '189 patent to \nclaims at issue in  iLife Technologies, Inc., v [.] Nintendo of  \nAmerica, Inc.44  The representative claim at  issue there was \ndirected to a motion detection  system that includes a sensor and \nprocessor and that evaluated relative movement of a body based on dynamic acceleration and static acceleration.  The Federal Circuit found that  these claims were directed to an abstract idea where the \nclaims were not focused on a \u201c specific means or method to \nimprove motion sensor systems\u201d  nor a \u201c specific physical  \nconfiguration of sensors. \u201d\n45  Nor did the patent  specification \ninclude great detail about how the claim helped improve sensor systems.\n46  Here,  in contrast, claim 9 is directed to a specific  \ndevice to improve audience measurement  technology in a \nparticular way, and the  specification explains how this was so.   \n Lastly, Defendant also highlights Yu  v[.] Apple Inc. ,\n47 a Federal \nCircuit case, as  the most analogous case to claim 9 in its  \nsupplemental letter.48  However, in that case,  the type of camera \nconfiguration that the  specification described as a technological  \n \n41  (Id.) \n \n42  Thales , 850 F.3d at 1348.  \n \n43  (D.I. 18 at 8)  \n \n44  iLife Techs., Inc. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc., 839 F. App\u2019x 534 (Fed. Cir. 2021). \n \n45  Id. at 537.   \n \n46  Id. at 538.  \n \n47  Yu v. Apple Inc., 1 F.4th 1040 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  \n \n48  (D.I. 42 at 1- 2) \n 13 \n improvement was [ not] claimed at all,49 whereas here it is, albeit \nbroadly.  Indeed, Defendant \u2019s counsel admitted today that had Yu \nclaimed that  purportedly unconventional arrangement  disclosed in \nthe specification, the outcome in Yu  likely would have been \ndifferent.50  Here,  again, our specification says directly that the  \nclaimed combination was unconventional, so this  case is not like \nYu.  In sum, while claim 9 may not be the most  detailed claim, the \nCourt easily finds that it is not directed to an abstract idea put \nforward  by [D] efendant, and, therefore, Defendant \u2019s motion must \nbe denied.  \n Defendant \u2019s motion also moves to dismiss  Plaintiff\u2019s claim for  \nwillful infringement.\n51  The Court will take that portion of the \nmotion  under advisement without argument.  [The Court] will \nissue a forthcoming order on that portion of  the motion. \n   \n \n49  Yu, 1 F.4th at 1044- 45. \n \n50 (D.I. 45 at 117)  \n \n51  (D.I. 12 at 17- 18) "}
