WILLIAMS \nUNITED ST ATES DISTRICT JUDGE \nPlaintiff Ronald Rider (\"Rider\") filed this action against Defendants PPG Industries , Inc. \n(\"PPG\"), the PPG Industries , Inc. Welfare Plan, and the PPG Industries , Inc. Retirement Plan C \n(collectively, \"Defendants\") to obtain retiree health and pension benefits that Rider alleges PPG \npromised to him (the \"Complaint,\" D.I. 1). Defendants argue that the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act (ERISA) preempts Counts III, IV, and V of the Complaint and move to \ndismiss those Counts with prejudice (the \"Motion\"). D.I. 8. Since Rider alleges that he \nbargained for enhanced retirement healthcare and pension benefits, the Court finds that ERISA \ndoes not preempt Counts III and IV. ERISA does preempt Count V. The Motion is fully \nbriefed, D.I. 8-1; D.I. 9; D.I. 12; D.I. 14-1, 1 and no hearing is necessary. \nI. BACKGROUND2 \nPPG first hired Rider, a resident of Dover, Delaware , on March 27, 1989, and PPG \nterminated Rider in January 2019. D.I. 1 ,r,r 19-20. PPG provides retiree healthcare benefits via \nthe PPG Welfare Plan and provides pension benefits via the PPG Retirement Plan C. D.I. 1 ,r,r \n10-14; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1), (2), (3). Rider contends he was eligible for both benefit types at the \ntime of his termination. D.I. 1 ,r,r 6, 26. After Rider obtained new work at Hirsch Industries , \nnear Dover, Rider applied for, interviewed for, and was offered a job as operations manager of \nPPG's Mount Laurel, New Jersey location. D.I. 1 ,r,r 22-25. Rider conditioned acceptance of his \nemployment offer on the reinstatement of both \"his prior eligibility for retiree pension benefits \n1 On April 11, 2022, Rider filed a Request for Leave to File a Sur-Reply to Defendants ' Reply \nBrief, and Rider represented that Defendants did not object to his motion. D.I. 14. Defendants \nhave not filed any objection since. Thus, the Court grants Rider's motion. \n2 Under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all factual allegations in the Complaint and \nview those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Fed. Trade Comm 'n v. Abb Vie \nInc, 976 F.3d 327,351 (3d Cir. 2020). \n1 ... as if his employment had not ended in 2019\" and \"his prior eligibility for company-provided \nretiree healthcare .... \" D.I. 1126. On January 7, 2020, PPG Human Resources Manager \nBarbara Mraz \"informed [Rider] that she would research\" \" whether his retiree healthcare and \nretiree pension benefits would be reinstated ifhe were rehired by PPG.\" D.I. 11128, 30. On \nJanuary 10, 2020, Mraz emailed Rider that, \nshould you become employed with PPG by January 31, 2020[,] your employment \nstatus will be re-instated as though there was not a break in service, to the same \nbenefit levels you had prior to outplacement of PPG in January 2019. These \nbenefits include all healthcare , retirement plan and retirement health care. \nD.I. 1 133 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reliance on that representation , Rider \"quit his \njob at Hirsch Industries and accepted the position with PPG at its Mount Laurel facility[,]\" \nbeginning on January 30, 2020. D.I. 1136-37. \nOn November 9, 2020, a PPG benefits department employee informed Rider that he was \nineligible for retiree healthcare benefits, and Mraz agreed to '\"reach out to them and explain \nwhere I got that information . I will pursue this.\"' D.I. 11141--43. On December 21, 2020, \nMraz \"verbally informed\" Rider of his ineligibility \"for retiree health coverage[,]\" but she \nprovided no \"information regarding the status of Mr. Rider's pension benefits .... \" D.I. 1147. \nPPG Plan Administrator Karen Rathburn informed Rider that he would not be permitted to \nparticipate in his retirement plan \"as if he had not been terminated in 2019 (i.e., receiving credit \nfor the additional year of service and the higher salary of his current position).\" D.I. 1 1153-54. \nBetween January 29, 2021 and September 8, 2021, Rathburn denied Rider's appeals regarding \nreinstatement of both his retiree healthcare benefits and retiree pension benefits. D.I. 11148-56. \nRider's claims sound in five counts: violation of ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(l) as to Rider's retiree \nhealthcare benefits (Count I), violation of ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) as to Rider's retiree healthcare and \npension benefits (Count II), breach of contract (Count III), promissory estoppel (Count IV), and \n2 negligent misrepresentation (Count V). D.I. 1 ,r,r 63-118. Count III alleges that Mraz's email \nwas an offer of retirement healthcare and income plan (i.e., pension)3 benefits, that Rider's \nacceptance created a contract, and that \"PPG has anticipatorily breached the parties' contract \n.... \" D.I. 1 ,r,r 91-97. Count IV alleges that Mraz's email was a \"clear and unambiguous\" \n\"promise to [Rider,]\" that Rider acted in reliance on that promise, and that Rider suffered \ndamages when he was not provided retirement healthcare and pension benefits as promised. D.I. \n1 ,r,r 100-107. Count V alleges that Mraz's email was a PPG representation made \"without \nreasonable care\" and that Rider relied on the PPG representation to his detriment when he \naccepted his employment offer. D.I. 1 ,r,r 109-115. Each of Counts III, IV, and V, brought \nagainst PPG, alone, seeks retiree healthcare and pension benefits. D.I. 1 ,r,r 90-118. The parties \nagree that each Count arises under state common law, D.I. 8-1 at 2; D.I. 9 at 1, but neither party \nspecifies which state's law applies. Defendants now move to dismiss Counts III, IV, and Vas \n\"duplicative of [Rider's] claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) and[] preempted by ERISA.\" D.I. 8-1 \nat 5. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nTo state a claim on which relief can be granted, a complaint must contain \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). Such a claim must plausibly suggest \"facts sufficient to 'draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"' Doe v. Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th 335, \n342 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) (citing Bell At!. Corp. v. \n3 The Complaint refers throughout to retirement \"health\" and \"pension\" benefits, see, e.g., D.I. 1 \n,r,r 24, 36, 38, but then refers in Counts III, IV, and V to \"retirement healthcare benefits\" and \n\"retirement income plan benefits[,]\" see D.I. 1 ,r,r 95-96, 105-06, 116-17. The Court \nunderstands the Complaint to use \"income plan\" to refer to a pension plan and, thus, will \ngenerally refer to the \"income plan\" as a \"pension.\" \n3 Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). \"A claim is facially plausible 'when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.'\" Klotz v. Celentano Stadtmauer & Walentowic z LLP, 991 F.3d 458, \n462 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). The Court disregards '\"legal conclusions \n... supported by mere conclusory statements .\"' Princeton Univ., 30 F.4th at 342 (quoting Davis \nv. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2016)). \n\"'The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimatel y prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Pracs. & Prod. \nLiab. Litig., 804 F.3d 633, 638 (3d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). \"A motion to dismiss [under \nRule 12(b)(6)] 'may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as \ntrue, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\"' \nMcCrone v. Acme Markets, 561 F. App'x 169, 172 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nPPG argues that the premise of Counts III, IV, and Vis PPG's alleged promise that Rider \n\"would have retiree benefits upon his reemployment. These claims are, therefore , duplicative of \nhis claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) and are preempted by ERISA.\" D.I. 8-1 at 5. Rider responds \nthat his claims are based on an independent and distinct \"agreement with PPG regarding the \nterms of his employment,\" so his claims \"are independent ofERISA. \" D.I. 9 at 1. The Court \ncannot, at this early stage in the proceedings , find that ERIS A preempts Counts III and IV. The \nCourt does, however, find that Count Vis preempted . \n4 A. The Factual Dispute as to the Nature of Rider's Communications with PPG \nThe parties dispute whether Rider (i) bargained for reinstated retiree healthcare and \npension benefits or (ii) inquired whether he would receive such benefits and received an \nincorrect answer. The Court, as it must, accepts the facts as Rider alleges them. \nDefendants argue that \"Rider's claim concerns whether PPG's interpretation of Mr. \nRider's eligibility for benefits under the Plan was accurate.\" D.I. 12 at 2. Defendants make this \nassertion repeatedly in their briefing, see D.I. 8-1 at 5 (making this assertion twice); D.I. 12 at 1, \n2, 3, 4 (\"Rider's claim boils down to whether PPG misrepresented his eligibility for the [ERISA] \nPlan.\"), but they fail to point to specific alleged facts that support their position. Nevertheless , \nthe Court finds that certain facts asserted in the Complaint do support Defendants ' position. For \nexample, Rider alleges that he \"called and emailed ... Mraz[] to inquire whether his retiree \nhealthcare and retiree pension benefits would be reinstated[,]\" and \"Mraz informed [Rider] that \nshe [i.e., Mraz] would research the question. \" D.I. ,r,r 28, 30 (emphases added). Further, Mraz's \nJanuary 10, 2020 email explains that Rider's \"employment status will be re-instated \" along with \nhealthcare benefits, and Rider alleges that he \"had an objectively reasonable expectation that Ms. \nMraz was providing [Rider] with accurate information regarding his benefits.\" D.I. 1 ,r,r 33, 35 \n( emphasis added). Indeed, Mraz was a human resources employee , rather than a PPG recruiter \nor supervisor , D.I. ,r,r 26-27, performing research as to Rider's benefit eligibility. Thus, the \nCourt could infer that Mraz sought to answer Rider's benefits inquiry-not to negotiate \nemployment terms. Rider's Count V also alleges that PPG's \"representation \" ofreinstated \nbenefits was \"made ... in the course of [PPG's] business and ... without reasonable care.\" D.I. \n,r,r 109-10. Based on Count V and these alleged facts alone, this case concerns Rider's inquiry \nas to his benefits status upon rehire. \n5 However, Rider argues that Counts III, IV, and V \"are based on [Rider]'s agreement with \nPPG regarding the terms of his employment .... \" D.I. 9 at 1; see D.I. 14-1 at 1-2. Rider alleges \nthat reinstatement of healthcare and pension benefits were \"conditions for [Rider's] acceptance \nof the [rehire] position .... \" D.I. 1 ,r 26. Rider alleges he made these conditions clear to PPG's \n\"Talent Acquisitions Personnel \" and to Mraz. D.I. 1 ,r,r 26, 29. Further, Mraz's January 10 \nemail copied \"the general manager of the Mount Laurel facility,\" and Rider alleges that \"Mraz's \ninclusion of the Mount Laurel general manager in the communication\" supported Rider's \n\"objectively reasonable expectation ... that Ms. Mraz's offer was binding on PPG .... \" D.I. ,r,r \n34-35. Count III alleges that Mraz's email constituted an offer and that, once Rider accepted the \noffer and began work, PPG was bound to reinstate the benefits. D.I. ,r,r 91-96. Count IV, \nsimilarly, alleges that Mraz's email was a promise and that, once Rider began work in reliance \nthereon, PPG should be held to its promise. D.I. ,r,r 100-06. \nIn short, Rider alleges that he negotiated for reinstatement of benefits, not that he simply \nasked whether PPG's ERISA plan would provide for such benefits. While both parties could \npoint to factual allegations that support their description of events, at the motion to dismiss stage, \nthe Court must '\"construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and \ndetermine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint , the plaintiff may be entitled \nto relief.\"' AbbVie Inc., 976 F.3d at 351 (citation omitted). Discovery may reveal a different \npattern of events, and Defendants may ask the Court to reevaluate its analysis at summary \njudgment. \nB. Whether ERISA Preempts Rider's Common Law Claims \nSince Count V rests on an alleged misrepresentation of Rider's benefit status, the Court \nfinds that ERISA preempts Count V. However , ERISA does not preempt Counts III and IV \nbecause Rider alleges an independent agreement with PPG as to his retirement benefits. \n6 \"ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and \ntheir beneficiaries.\" McCann v. Unum Provident, 907 F.3d 130, 143 (3d Cir. 2018) (cleaned up). \nCongress \"ensure[d] that benefit plan administration was subject to a single set ofregulations ... \nto avoid subjecting regulated entities to conflicting sources of substantive law.\" New Jersey \nCarpenters & the Trustees Thereofv . Tishman Const. Corp. of New Jersey, 760 F.3d 297,303 \n(3d Cir. 2014). The statute applies to employer-maintained employee benefit plans. McCann, \n907 F .3d at 142. \"Section 502( a) [] created a federal cause of action for [ERISA] plan \nbeneficiaries and participants to recover benefits due under a plan or to enforce the terms of the \nplan.\" Plastic Surgery Ctr., P.A. v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 967 F.3d 218,226 (3d Cir. 2020). \nClaims that \"fall within the scope of[\u00a7 502(a)] ... are completely preempted.\" Pryzbowski v. \nUS. Healthcare , Inc., 245 F.3d 266,272 (3d Cir. 2001). \nSection 502(a) permits an ERISA plan participant to bring a civil action (i) \"to recover \nbenefits due to him under the terms of his [ERISA] plan\" or (ii) \"to obtain[] appropriate \nequitable relief ... to enforce [provisions of the ERISA statute] or the terms of the [ERISA] plan \n.... \" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132(a)(l)(B), (a)(3)(B); see Pell v. E.I DuPont de Nemours & Co. Inc., \n539 F.3d 292, 300 (3d Cir. 2008) (reciting the standard for \"appropriate equitable relief'). \"[A] \nclaim is completely preempted ... under ERISA \u00a7 502(a) only if: (1) the plaintiff could have \nbrought the claim under\u00a7 502(a); and (2) no other independent legal duty supports the plaintiff's \nclaim.\" New Jersey Carpenters, 760 F.3d at 303 (emphasis in original); see also Maglioli v. All. \nHC Holdings LLC, 16 F.4th 393,410 n.11 (3d Cir. 2021) (same). \"[A] legal duty is \n'independent' if it is not based on an obligation under an ERISA plan, or if it 'would exist \nwhether or not an ERISA plan existed.\"' New Jersey Carpenters, 760 F.3d at 303 (citation \nomitted). \"In other words, if the state law claim is not derived from, or conditioned upon the \n7 terms of an ERISA plan, and nobody needs to interpret the plan to determine whether that duty \nexists, then the duty is independent. \" Id. (cleaned up). \nThe Second Circuit uses the same two-part test as the Third Circuit uses to determine \nwhether\u00a7 502(a) completely preempts ERISA claims, and the Second Circuit has issued two \ninstructive opinions. First, in Stevenson , the Second Circuit found that a breach of contract claim \nthat arose from a promise to maintain an employee 's benefits while he worked for an overseas \naffiliate was not preempted . Stevenson v. Bank of New York Co., 609 F.3d 56, 60-61 (2d Cir. \n2010). The court explained that the \"defendants ' asserted liabilities \" derive \"from a separate \npromise that references various benefit plans, none of which directly applies to [plaintiff] by its \nterms, as a means of establishing the value of that promise.\" Id. The court noted that the \ndefendant company-not the ERISA plans-would have to pay damages and that the claims \nwould not affect \"the actual administration and funding\" of the ERISA plans. Id. at 61. Second, \nin Arditi, when an ERISA plan beneficiary sued his former employer for failure to credit him \nwith service time as promised in his employment agreement , the Second Circuit found the claims \npreempted because the ERISA plan (not the employment agreement) \"was the basis for the \nclaimed benefits.\" Arditi v. Lighthouse Int'l, 676 F.3d 294, 300 (2d Cir. 2012), as amended \n(Mar. 9, 2012). The Second Circuit distinguished Stevenson because, there, the plaintiffs rights \narose \"not from the [ERISA] plan, but from the independent agreement that gave [plaintiff] \nbenefits even though [plaintiff] had no right to them under the plan.\" Id. at 300-01. \nIn the instant action , there is little dispute that Rider could bring his claims under ERISA. \nSee D.I. 9 at 6-11 (focusing on PPG's independent legal duty). Counts III, IV, and V seek \nretiree healthcare and pension benefits. D.I. 1 ,r,r 95-96, 105-06, 116-17. Rider admits he can \nseek retiree health benefits under ERISA because his Complaint alleges that his prior service \n8 entitles him to such benefits under the ERISA plan 's terms. D.I. 1 ,r,r 67-72. Count II seeks \nretiree healthcare and pension benefits under the same equitable estoppel theory that Rider \nadvances in Count IV, and Count II directly alleges \"material[] misrepresent[ation, ]\" as does \nCount V. D.I. 1 ,r,r 75-79, 82, 102-07, 112. The same conduct also underlies Counts II through \nV. See D.I. 1 ,r,r 74, 79, 90-91, 99-100, 108-09. Thus, Rider can bring his claims under ERISA. \nThe next question is whether an independent legal duty supports Rider's claim. Counts \nIII and IV seek retiree healthcare and pension benefits that PPG' s ERIS A plan would have to pay \nto Rider. See D.I. 1 ,r,r 95-96, 105-06. Thus, unlike in Stevenson and similar to Arditi, the \nERISA plan-not PPG-would have to pay the damages sought. But see D.I. 1 at 18 (seeking \ncompensatory damages \"[i]n the alternative\"). Count IV brings the same equitable estoppel \nclaim under common law that Count II brings under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). Compare D.I. 1 ,r,r \n100-04 (reciting a promise to reinstate retiree healthcare and pension benefits and reasonable \nreliance thereon), with D.I. 1 ,r,r 80-82 (same). However, neither finding answers whether \nCounts III and IV are based on a duty independent of ERISA that PPG owed Rider. See Aetna \nHealth Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200,210 (2004) (asking whether any \"legal duty (state or federal) \nindependent of ERISA or the plan terms is violated\"); Caivano v. Prod. Workers Union Loe. \n148, 2014 WL 2931183, at *7 (D.N.J. June 30, 2014) (not finding preemption although the \nERISA plan was \"the source of the benefits\" sought); S.MA. Med., Inc. v. UnitedHealth Grp., \nInc., 2020 WL 1912215, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 20, 2020) (not finding preemption although ''the \nplaintiffs claims are derived from ERISA plans and exist only because of those plans\"). \nAt least at this early stage of the proceedings , Rider can show that a legal duty \nindependent of\u00a7 502(a) supports Counts III and IV. Neither Count is \"derived from, or \nconditioned upon the terms of an ERISA plan, and nobody needs to interpret the plan to\" decide \n9 if PPG had a contract with Rider or made a promise to Rider. New Jersey Carpenters, 760 F.3d \nat 303 (cleaned up). A factfinder need only determine , as to Counts III and IV, whether PPG \noffered or promised to reinstate Rider's retiree healthcare and pension benefits \"'as though there \nwas not a break in service, to the same benefit levels [he] had prior to outplacement in January \n2019.\"' D.I. 1 ,r,r 95-96, 105-06. In other words, Rider's \"right to recovery [under Counts III \nand IV], if it exists, depends entirely on the operation of third-party contracts ... that are \nindependent of the [ERISA] Plan[].\" Pascack Valley Hosp. v. Loe. 464A UFCW Welfare \nReimbursement Plan, 388 F.3d 393,402 (3d Cir. 2004), as amended (Dec. 23, 2004). \nOn the contrary, Count V alleges a misrepresentation of the terms of PPG's ERISA plan, \nso ERISA preempts Count V. Count V recites that PPG \"made [a] representation\" to Rider, via \nMraz's email, that \"[Rider's] employment status [would] be reinstated as though there was not a \nbreak in service, to the same benefit levels [Rider] had prior to outplacement of PPG in January \n2019.\" D.I. 1 ,r 109 (internal quotation marks omitted). Count V further alleges that Mraz's \nemail was sent in the course of PPG's business, that the representation was \"material to [Rider]'s \ndecision to become re-employed with PPG[,]\" that Rider \"justifiably relied upon PPG's \nrepresentation to his detriment[ ,]\" and that the representation was made \"without reasonable \ncare.\" D.I. 1 ,r,r 109-14. The Complaint also alleges that Rider was a participant in PPG's \nERISA plan at the time of Mraz's representation , see D.I. 1 ,r 9, and individuals responsible for \nERIS A plans have a \"' duty not to misinform \"' plan participants, In re Unisys Corp. Retiree Med. \nBenefits ERISA Litig., 579 F.3d 220,228 (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted) (discussing fiduciary \nduties under ERISA). To find for Rider, a factfinder would have to find that Mraz made a \nmisrepresentation , and such a finding is conditioned , at least in part, \"upon the terms of an \nERISA plan .... \" New Jersey Carpenters , 760 F.3d at 303 (cleaned up). Rider fails to plausibly allege a claim for material misrepresentation that asserts a duty independent of that \nowed to an ERISA plan participant under the ERISA plan's terms or the ERISA statute. \nAgain, Section 502(a) preempts a state law claim only if \"(I) the plaintiff could have \nbrought the claim under\u00a7 502(a); and (2) no other independent legal duty supports the plaintiff's \nclaim.\" Id (emphasis in original). While Rider could bring Counts III, IV, and V under ERISA, \nan independent legal duty exists as to Counts III and IV. Thus,\u00a7 502(a) does not preempt those \nclaims. An independent legal duty does not exist as to Count V. Thus,\u00a7 502(a) does preempt \nCount V. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court denies Defendants ' motion to dismiss Counts III and IV. \nThe Court grants Defendants ' motion to dismiss Count V. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) requires the Court to \"freely give leave [to \namend] when justice so requires.\" But dismissal with prejudice for futility is appropriate when \n'\"the complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\"' \nTravelers lndem. Co. v. Dammann & Co., 594 F.3d 238,243 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); \nsee Knowles v. Temple Univ., 2022 WL 3037258, at * 1 (3d Cir. Aug. 2, 2022). Here, no claim \nfor misrepresentation that is consistent with the facts in Count V of the Complaint could invoke a \nduty independent of the ERISA plan's duty to its participants. Therefore , the Court dismisses \nCount V with prejudice. \nThe Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n11 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nRONALD RIDER, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nPPG INDUSTRIES, Inc.; PPG INDUSTRIES , \nInc.
