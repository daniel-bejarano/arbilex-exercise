Attorneys for Defendant. \nOctober l(i022 \n1 ~D STATES DISTRICT JUDGE: \nBefore me is Defendant's supplemental motion for summary judgment of non-. \ninfringement based on collateral estoppel. (D.I. 730). I have considered the parties' briefing. \n(D.I. 731, 735, 739). For the reasons set forth below, I will DENY-IN-PART and GRANT-IN\u00ad\nPART Defendant's motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff filed suit against Defendant alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,701,344 \n('344 Patent), 6,714,966 ('966 Patent), 6,732,147 (' 147 Patent), 6,829,634 ('634 Patent), \n6,910,069 ('069 Patent), and 6,920,497 ('497 Patent). (D.I. 1 at iflO). \nIn a summary judgment ruling in 2018, I resolved many of the issues in this case. (See \nD.I. 578, 579). For example, I granted Defendant's summary judgment motion as to the invalidity \nof all asserted claims of the '634 Patent. (D.I. 578 at 3, 9). Only two infringement allegations \nremain: (1) infringement by the accused Call of Duty (\"CoD\") and Destiny games of the '147 and \n'069 Patents, and (2) infringement by the accused World of Warcraft (\"WoW'') game of the '344 \nand '966 Patents. (See D.I. 731 at 3 n.3). \nThis case is related to Acceleration Bay LLC v. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., No. \n16-455-RGA (\"Take-Two Case\"), where Plaintiff accused online features of three video games\u00ad\nNBA 2Kl 5 and NBA 2Kl 6 (collectively, ''NBA 2K\"), and Grand Theft Auto Online (\"GTAO\")\u00ad\nof infringing the '344, '966, '147, and '069 Patents. See Take-Two Case, 2020 WL 1333131, at \n*1 (D. Del. Mar, 23, 2020) (\"Take-Two SJ Opinion\"), appeal dismissed sub nom. Acceleration. \nBay LLC v. 2K Sports, Inc., 2020 WL 9459373 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 2, 2020) (dismissing cross-appeal), \nand aff'd in part, dismissed in part sub nom. Acceleration Bay LLC v. 2K Sports, Inc., 15 F.4th \n1069 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (\"Take-Two Appeal\"). In the Take-Two Case, the defendants moved for \n2 summary judgment of non-infringement, which I granted in a detailed opinion. See Take-Two SJ \nOpinion. Plaintiff appealed. See Take-Two Appeal. \nOn April 21, 2020, I stayed this case pending resolution of Plaintiff's appeal of my \nsummary judgment ruling in the Take-Two Case. (See D.I. 711). The Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit issued a decision on that appeal on October 4, 2021. See Take-Two Appeal \n(affirming-in-part and dismissing-in-part as moot). With the Take-Two Case's appeal resolved, \nDefendant now moves for summary judgment of nonin:fringement, arguing that Plaintiff is \ncollaterally estopped from relitigating infringement issues it lost in the Take-Two Case. \nIn this case, each remaining asserted claim requires a network that is \"m-regular.\" I \nconstrued \"m-regular\" to mean \"[a] state that the network is configured to maintain, where each \n[participant or computer] is connected to exactly m neighbor [participants or computers].\" (D.I. \n287 at 5). This construction also applied in the Take-Two Case, and Defendant did not appeal this \nconstruction. See Take-Two Appeal. \nI held oral argument on the pending motion on September 30, 2022. (See D.I. 742). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). Material facts are those ''that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding, and \"a \ndispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to \nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. \n2011) (cleaned up). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \n3 in that party's favor. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d \n180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). \nCollateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, bars parties from relitigating matters \nthat they previously had a full and fair opportunity to litigate. See Montana v. United States, 440 \nU.S. 147, 153 (1979). This \"protects their adversaries from the expense and vexation attending \nmultiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by \nminimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\" Id at 153-54. \nIn a patent case, the law of the regional circuit applies to collateral estoppel generally and \nFederal Circuit precedent applies where the determination of collateral estoppel involves \nsubstantive issues of patent law. See Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps South, LLC, 735 F.3d 1333, \n1342 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Under Third Circuit law, collateral estoppel applies when \"(1) the issue \nsought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the prior action; (2) that issue was actually \nlitigated; (3) it was determined by a final and valid judgment; and (4) the determination was \nessential to the prior judgment.\" Burlington N R. Co. v. Hyundai Merch. Marine Co., 63 F.3d \n1227, 1231-32 (3d Cir. 1995) (cleaned up). The \"essential to \u00b7the prior judgment\" element can be \nsatisfied when the prior judgment was reached through alternative findings. Jean Alexander \nCosms., Inc. v. L 'Oreal USA, Inc., 458 F.3d244, 255 (3d Cir. 2006) (\"we will follow the traditional \nview that independently sufficient alternative findings should be given preclusive effect\"). \nWhether the \"basic requirements for issue preclusion are satisfied\" is a question of law. Id at \n248; see also Ohio Willow Wood, 735 F.3d at 1341 (de novo review of the application of collateral \nestoppel). \nAs is particular to patent law, \"an infringement claim in a second suit is the same claim as \nin an earlier infringement suit if the accused products in the two suits are essentially the same.\" \n4 Phil-Insul Corp. v. Airlite Plastics Co., 854 F.3d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). \n\"Accused [products] are essentially the same where the differences between them are merely \ncolorable or unrelated to the limitations in the claim of the patent.\" Id. ( cleaned up). The accused \nproduct in a second suit need not be produced by the same company as that considered in a first \nsuit. See Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Zenni Optical Inc., 713 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (in \nholding that \"collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely \nswitching adversaries,\" affirming \"that [ a second defendant's] accused rimless magnetic clip-on \nsunglasses are materially indistinguishable from [ a first defendant's] rimless magnetic clip-on \nsunglasses\") ( cleaned up). The alleged infringer \"bears the burden of showing that the accused \ndevices are essentially the same as those in the prior litigation.\" ArcelorMittal Atlantique et \nLorraine v. AK Steel Corp., 908 F.3d 1267, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Issues Previously Adjudicated in the Take-Two Case \nThe Parties' dispute centers around three noninfringement issues I decided in the Take\u00ad\nTwo SJ Opinion. \nFirst, for GTAO, I considered the player movement issue. Plaintiff argued that GTAO \ninfringes them-regular limitation because the players' avatars \"share more data when they are near \neach other\" thus causing an m-regular network to \"arise naturally as the players are moving \nthroughout the game.\" Take-Two SJ Opinion at *8 (cleaned up). In rejecting this argument, I \nheld, \"Under my claim construction, a network is not m-regular if the participants just happen to \nconnect to the same number of other participants occasionally. Rather, the network must be \n'configured to maintain' anm-regular state.\" Id. Based on this, I held that \"the [GTAO] players' \nactions determine how connections are formed, and the network is not 'configured to maintain' \n5 any particular state.\" Id. I explained that \"if a system is designed to achieve a desired result, one \nwould not normally say the result 'just arises naturally.\"' Id. \nSecond, for NBA 2K, I considered the all-connected server issue. Plaintiff argued that a \nserver which connects to all the virtual basketball players is not a \"participant\" in the game and, \nthus, does not negate m-regularity. Id. at *9. I disagreed, finding that, \"the server is not playing \nbasketball .... The server is, however, a participant in the network because it transfers data back \nand forth between other network participants. These patent claims are directed to network \nmanagement, so what matters is whether the server is a participant in the network, not whether it \nis making jump shots or grabbing rebounds.\" Id. \nThird, I considered Plaintiff's Doctrine of Equivalents (\"DOE\") argument that the GTAO \nnetwork performs substantially the same function as an m-regular network by \"optimizing the . \nentire network processing of the network by limiting each participant's network connections\" so \nthat \"data are distributed in a balanced fashion over the network.\" Id. at *8 (cleaned up); see also \nid. at *10 (similar DOE argument for NBA 2K). I rejected this DOE argument because it \n\"effectively reads the m-regular limitation out of the patent\" when \"[t]here is no mention of \nparticipants connecting to the same number of other participants.\" Id. at *9; see also id. at *10 \n(rejecting Plaintiff's DOE argument for NBA 2K for the same reason). \nDefendant explains that these three issues were actually litigated, determined by final and \nvalid judgment, and essential to the prior judgment. (See D.I. 731 at 7-8; see also Burlington, 63 \nF .3d at 1231-32). Plaintiff does not contest that these requirements for collateral estoppel are met. \n(See generally D.I. 735). I agree with Defendant, and find that these three issues were actually \nlitigated (see generally Take-Two SJ Opinion; Take-Two Appeal), were determined by a final and \nvalid judgment (see generally Take-Two SJ Opinion; see also Phil-Insul Corp., 854 F.3d at 1357 \n6 (\"the noninfringement determinations in [ a previous case] are final for collateral estoppel purposes \nby virtue of [a plaintiff's] failure to appeal them\")), and were essential to the prior judgment (see \nTake-Two SJ Opinion at *7-10). \nB. Issues Currently Being Adjudicated \nDefendant argues that noninfringement issues being considered in this case are identical to \nthe player movement, all-connected server, and DOE issues that were previously adjudicated in \nthe Take-Two Case. \n1. Destiny \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff's literal infringement theory for Destiny is collaterally \nestopped based on both the player movement issue and the all-connected server issue. (D.I. 731 \nat 10-11, 16-17). \nFor the player movement issue, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's infringement theory relies \non the \"undisputed\" fact that m-regularity is only established \"when [players] move their game \ncharacters close to each other in the game world.\" (Id. at 10-11 (citing D.I. 443, Ex. A-4 \n(Mitzenmacher's Reply Report) at 1136, 41, 45-46, 113 (\"A player can connect to another Bubble's \nActivity Host when they run close to the geographic transition area with that Bubble.\"))). \nDefendant asserts that this theory is collaterally estopped because, as was considered with the \nplayer movement issue for GTAO, \"whether the Destiny network ever becomes or stays m-regular \n... depends on 'players' actions.\"' (Id. at 11 ). \nPlaintiff responds that the Destiny network's m-regularity is maintained \"regardless of \nplayer movements.\" (D.I. 735 at 8-10, 8). For example, Dr. Mitzenmacher explains that each \nmember of in-game \"Fire Teams\" are configured in a network in an m-regular state, where, even \nif a player leaves a Fire Team, \"the network is configured to return to them-regular state by filling \n7 the reserve slot with a new participant.\" (D.I. 454, Ex. 35 (Mitzenmacher Reply Report) at ,r,r41-\n46, 42; see also D.I. 454, Ex. 28 (Mitzenmacher Report) at ifif291-296 (explaining that \"the \n[Destiny] software attempts to maintain connectivity among the players once a multiplayer game \nsession has been established\" even \"when a peer migrates to a different Bubble\")). \nI find that Defendant has not shown that the player movement issue being considered with \nDestiny is essentially the same as what I considered with GTAO. Instead, as Mitzenmacher \nmakes clear, there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether them-regularity of the Destiny \nnetwork is dependent on player movement. \nFor the all-connected server issue, Defendant argues that all participants are connected to \na \"BAP [(Bungie Access Protocol)] Server,\" which \"makes m-regularity impossible under the \nCourt's rulings.\" (D.I. 731 at 16-17 (citing D.I. 732, Ex. 4 (Mitzenmacher Dep. Tr.) at 42:19-23 \n(\"Q: And do you understand that each of these fireteam members has a-maintains a connection \nto the BAP server throughout their participation in the game? A: That sounds correct.\"); D.I. 732, \nEx. 2 (Mitzenmacher Reply Report) at if33 (\"[T]he specifications of the Asserted Patents ... do \nnot preclude the participants in a broadcast channel from having additional connections to other \nnetworks.\"))).1 \nPlaintiff responds that the \"BAP server is only used to facilitate the formation of a ... \nnetwork,\" and, \"[ o ]nee the game starts, the BAP Server is no longer involved and, in particular, it \nis not broadcasting the gameplay messages[.]\" (D.I. 735 at 11 (citing D.I. 454, Ex. 28 at ,r,r80, \n89, 191 (\"Thus, once this information from the BAP server and gatherer is provided to the \nincoming participant, connections to the broadcast channel and neighbors in the game session will \n1 I understand the expert to mean the asserted claims, not the specifications. \n8 be established to form a fully connected state.\"), ,-i,-i197, 198 (\"The players send a matchmaking \nrequest to the matchmaking server through the BAP server over the internet.\"))). \nFrom my review, it is unclear whether the BAP server is all-connected. For example, \nDefendant's cited portion of Dr. Mitzenmacher' s deposition testimony is inconclusive regarding \nwhether the BAP server maintains a connection to each participant during gameplay. (See D.I. \n732, Ex. 4 at 42: 19-23 (\"That sounds correct.\")). Rather, the cited evidence suggests that the BAP \nserver is used for matchmaking. (See, e.g., D.I. 443, Ex. A-2 at ,-r192 (\"To join a game play area \nwith other players, a matchmaking service is used through the BAP Server .... The players [send] \na request to the matchmaking service through the BAP server which facilitates connections to other \nclients in the instance one may want to join.\"). In contrast, the NBA 2K servers were used for \n\"gameplay data.\" See Take-Two SJ Opinion at *9 (considering that the NBA 2K servers \"are \nparticipants in the NBA 2K Mesh Network because they can equally send and receive heartbeat \ndata, lockstep data, gameplay data, and VoIP data to other participants in the network\")). Thus, \nI do not find that the accused products are essentially the same. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff is not collaterally estopped from proceeding with the literal \ninfringement theory it articulates above for Destiny. \n2. Call of Duty \nPlaintiff asserts that CoD relies on two networks that are literally infringing: the \n\"connectivity graph network\" and the \"gameplay logics network.\" (D .I. 731 at 9-10). During \nthe oral argument, Plaintiff stated that it dropped the \"gameplay logics network\" infringement . \ntheory. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's remaining infringement theory relying on the \n\"connectivity graph network\" is collaterally estopped based on both the player movement issue \nand the all-connected server issue. (Id. at 9-10, 15-16). \n9 For the player movement issue, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's infringement theory relies \non players configuring their routers so that they cause \"NAT configuration issues.\" (D .I. 731 at \n9-10 (citing D.I. 443, Ex. A-1 (Medvidovic Report) at ,r,r161, 188-190)). Defendant explains that, \njust as players' actions caused m-regularity in GTAO, \"the network configuration ... that allegedly \nmight lead to an m-regular configuration [in CoD] is dynamic and determined by player actions \n[related to how each player] configure[s] the NAT setting on their router.\" (Id at 10). \nPlaintiff responds that the CoD players configure their routers before they enter a game. \n(See D.I. 735 at 12-14). \"This is very different from the GTA infringement case, where the \nplayers' actions during the course of the game influence the network connections.\" (Id at 13 \n(emphasis omitted)). \nI find that these infringement issues are not the same. With GTAO, the players' in-game \nactions could from time-to-time cause the network to become m-regular. See Take-Two SJ \nOpinion at * 8 ( considering that \"the players' actions determine how connections are formed, and \nthe network is not 'configured to maintain' any particular state\"). Plaintiffs theory in this case is \nnot based on in-game actions. \nFor the all-connected server issue, Defendant argues that each CoD player is connected to \na host and \"at least some of the data being transferred by that host is the same type of data that \nPlaintiff's expert identifies as being transferred [by the players] in the 'connectivity graph \nnetwork.\"' (D.I. 731 at 15). Defendant points to the \"connectivity graph network\" being \"set up \nby various messages sent to and from the host,\" and the host providing \"a list of neighbor \nI \nparticipants\" when a player disconnects. (Id at 15 ( citing D.I. 443, Ex. A-1 (Medvidovic Report) \nat ,r,r291, 449)). Additionally, Defendant notes that \"it is undisputed that sometimes when two \nplayers are not able to send voice data directly to one another over this network, this voice data \n10 itself is instead relayed through-the host server that is connected to everyone in the game.\" (Id. \nat 15-16 (citing D.I. 732, Ex. 1 (Griffith Dep. Transcript) at 252:11-253:9)). Thus, Defendant \nasserts that there is no material difference between the all-connected server issue for CoD and \nNBA 2K. (Id.) \nPlaintiff responds that the \"connectivity graph network\" does not rely on an all-connected \nhost server \"once [it's] operating.\" (D.I. 735 at 14-15, 14). Further, while the host server may \nhave the \"'capability to relay voice [data,]\"' this capability only applies \"'when [the connectivity \ngraph network] does not achieve a full mesh topology.\"' (D.I. 735 at 14 (quoting D.I. 480, Ex. \n72 (Macedonia Dep. Transcript) at 32:19-43:4, 43:2-4)). \nI am not convinced by Defendant's arguments and find that the CoD connectivity graph \nnetwork is not essentially the same as the network considered for NBA 2K. Even if the host server \nis connected to all participants when establishing the connectivity graph network, the parties \ndispute whether the host server is also a participant during gameplay. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff is not collaterally estopped from proceeding with its \n\"connectivity graph network\" literal infringement theory for CoD. \n3. WoW \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs literal infringement theory for Wo W is collaterally \nestopped based on both the player movement issue and the all-connected server issue. (D.I. 731 \nat 11-12, 17-18). \nFor the player movement issue, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs \"cross realm zones\" \ninfringement theory relies on a \"scenario [that] depends on the transient connections formed when \nfour players assigned to four different realms each move their avatar to a 'cross realm zone' and \n11 'chat' with one another.\" (D.I. 731 at 11-12 (citing D.I. 443, Ex. A-1 (Medvidovic Report) at \n11102, 210)). \nPlaintiff responds that, fundamentally, \"the infringing WoW [cross-realm] network \nconnects Activision's network servers, and not the individual computers of people playing Wo W.\" \n(D.I. 735 at 15). Plaintiff explains that a \"WoW Server-to-Server Network\" is used for the cross \nrealm zones, where \"[t]he connections in the servers in the WoW Server-to-Server Network are \nstatic and persistent, created by Activision in advance, and do not vary based on player movement \n(or any other player input).\" (Id. at 15-16, 16 (citing D.I. 455, Ex. 40 (Medvidovic report) at \n11207-209)). For example, Dr. Medvidovic explains, \"The realm bundles will start with a static \nconfiguration with a set amount of connections, forming an m-regular network.\" (D.I. 455, Ex. \n40 at 11207-210, 209). \nI agree with Plaintiff. While Defendant supports its argument by citing paragraph 210 of \nDr. Medvidovic's report, this paragraph does not indisputably state that the connections of the \ncross-realm zone are transient or dependent on player movement. (See D.I. 443, Ex. A-1 at 1210 \n(\"Each realm in the cross-realm area will also have its own Chat Server making 4 Chat Servers in \nthe 4 realm bundle .... When a message needs to [be] distributed to the area, the User Server will \nsend the message to its Chat Server, the Chat Server will send multiple copies of that message to \nthe User Servers in the area .... This results in the network being m-regular with exactly the same \nnumber of connections, 4 connections, in the cross-realm area with a bundle of 4 realms.\")). \nFor the all-connected server issue, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's \"cross-realm zone\" \ninfringement theory is flawed because it ignores numerous additional \"HiMem\" servers that are \nalso network participants and \"whose connections make m-regularity impossible.\" (D.I. 731 at \n17-18, 17). In a footnote, Plaintiff responds that these additional server connections are irrelevant \n12 because \"[Defendant] is relying on connections to servers that are not part of them-regular Wo W \nServer-to-Server Network.\" (D.I. 735 at 16 n.2). \nI am not convinced by Defendant's argument. Considering the cited evidence, it is unclear \nwhether the \"HiMem servers\" are network participants. Thus, I do not find that this infringement \nissue is the same as what I considered with NBA 2K, where the evidence supported the all\u00ad\nconnected server being a network participant. (See Take-Two SJ Opinion at *9). \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff is not collaterally estopped from proceeding with its literal \ninfringement theory for Wo W. \n4. Doctrine of Equivalents \nDefendant argues that the DOE issue~ being considered in this case are identical to the \nDOE issues that were previously adjudicated for GT AO and NBA 2K. Defendant explains, \"In \nTake-Two this Court rejected, as a matter oflaw, Plaintiff's DOE theories because they 'effectively \nread[] the m-regular limitation out of the patent' and because 'Plaintiff is barred by prosecution \nhistory estoppel from now attempting- to erase that limitation from the patents.\"' (D.I. 731 at 18 \n(quoting Take-Two SJ Opinion at *9)). Defendant asserts that, in this case, \"Plaintiff's expert \nopinions on DOE are nearly identical to the ones this Court found legally barred [in Take-Two], \nsuch that collateral estoppel applies here as well.\" (D .I. 731 at 18-19, 18 ( citing id., App. 1 \n(quoting the DOE theories brought forth by Plaintiff's experts for CoD, Destiny, and Wo W))). \nWithout citing any evidence, Plaintiff disagrees, arguing that \"the infringement claims \n[Plaintift] is pursuing against Destiny, Call of Duty, and World of Warcraft are based on specific \nrules that make the network participants have the same number of connections, not load balancing \n(as the Court found for GTA), and the relevant networks are not based on a central relay server (as \nthe Court found for NBA 2K).\" (D.I. 735 at 17). \n13 In granting summary judgment in the Take-Two SJ Opinion, I explained that Plaintiffs \nDOE arguments for both GTAO and NBA 2K were flawed because they attempt \"to remove \ninconvenient claim elements, such as them-regular limitation.\" (Take-Two SJ Opinion at *10). \nThis reasoning was underscored by the fact that \"for the '344, '966, and '147 patents ... the \npatentee added the m-regular limitation during prosecution\" to overcome \"a specific prior art \nreference[,]\" thus barring Plaintiff \"by prosecution history estoppel from now attempting to erase \nthat limitation from the patents.\" (Id. at *9). \nI agree with Defendant. The portions of Plaintiffs expert report cited by Defendant show \nthat, in this case, Plaintiffs expert is effectively reading them-regular limitation out of the asserted \nclaims by arguing that product functions that balance network connections achieve the same result \nas them-regular limitation. (See, e.g., D.I. 443, Ex. A-1 (Medvidovic Report) at ,r,r215-218 (for \nCoD, explaining that the software performs the function of\"not overload[ing] a particular software \napplication node \u00b7on the network\" by \"limiting the number of neighbor connections for each \nparticipant\" to achieve the same result as an m-regular network)). Plaintiff relied on the same \nDOE arguments in Take-Two. (See D.I. 731, App. 1). \nWhile there are material differences between the accused products in this case and Take\u00ad\nTwo as they relate to Plaintiffs literal infringement claims, I do not find that there are material \ndifferences between these products for purposes of DOE. Specifically, I find that the accused \nproducts in this case and Take-Two are essentially the same because, in both cases, Plaintiff relies \non a product function that balances network connections as satisfying the m-regular limitation \nunder DOE. Any other differences between the products-such as those identified above when \nconsidering literal infringement-\" are merely colorable or unrelated\" to Plaintiffs infringement \nclaims for them-regular limitation under DOE. Phil-Insul Corp., 854 F.3d at 1353. My belief \n14 that the accused products are essentially the same is buttressed by Plaintiffs inability to point to \nany evidence supporting meaningful differences in the accused products as they relate to \ninfringement of the m-regular limitation under DOE. (See D.I. 735 at 17; see also Phil-Insul \nCorp., 854 F.3d at 1353; Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v. Maersk Contractors \nUSA, Inc., 617 F.3d 1296, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (applying collateral estoppel when the \ninfringement issue in a second case was identical to the issue considered in an earlier case, and \nproduct differences \"[did] not change the fact that the [allegedly infringing product] does not \ninfringe\")). For these reasons, where each of the elements for collateral estoppel is met, I find \nthat Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from advancing its DOE theories in this case. \n5. Summary Judgment Absent Collateral Estoppel \nDefendant also argues, \"even if this court finds that collateral estoppel does not prevent \nPlaintiff from re-litigating some or all of the issues from Take Two identified here, [Defendant] \nstill respectfully submits that the Court should grant summary judgment of no infringement \n[because] Plaintiffs infringement theories in this case are indistinguishable from those rejected by \nthis Court in Take Two.\" (D .I. 731 at 19). Defendant previously moved for summary judgment \nof non-infringement, however, and I ruled on that motion. (See D.I. 578, 579). Thus, \nDefendant's present request for summary judgment of non-infringement is, in essence, an untimely \nmotion for reconsideration. I deny summary judgment on this alternative basis because \nDefendant has not met the standard for reconsideration. \nIV.
