Awareness Techs., Inc. , 2014 WL 906346, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 5, 2014).  A \nmotion for reconsideration \u201cmust rely on one of three grounds: (1) an in tervening change in \ncontrolling law; (2) the availability of new eviden ce; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of \nlaw or fact or to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d  Parkell v. Frederick , 2019 WL 1435884, at *1 (D. \nDel. Mar. 31, 2019).  Reconsideration may be appropriate where \u201cthe  Court has patently \nmisunderstood a party, or has made a decision outsi de the adversarial issu es presented to the \ncourt by the parties, or has made an erro r not of reasoning but of apprehension.\u201d  Wood v. Galef-\nSurdo , 2015 WL 479205, at *1 (D. Del. Jan. 26, 2015).  \n\u201cA motion for reconsideration is not properly grounded on a re quest that a court rethink a \ndecision already made.\u201d  Smith v. Meyers , 2009 WL 5195928, at *1 (D. Del. Dec. 30, 2009); see \nalso Glendon Energy Co. v. Borough of Glendon , 836 F. Supp. 1109, 1122 (E.D. Pa. 1993).  It \nis not an opportunity to \u201caccomplish repetition of  arguments that were or should have been \npresented to the court previously.\u201d  Karr v. Castle , 768 F. Supp. 1087, 1093 (D. Del. 1991).  \nWhile a decision on a motion for r econsideration is within the discretion of the Court, such \nmotions \u201cshould only be granted sparingly.\u201d  Kavanagh v. Keiper Recaro Seating, Inc. , 2003 \nWL 22939281, at *1 (D. Del. July 24, 2003). \nWi-LAN requests that the Court reconsider its Order granting  Defendants\u2019 motions, or, in \nthe alternative, tailor its f ee award to relate to  Wi-LAN\u2019s conduct during a narrower window of \ntime.  ( See D.I. 567 at 8)  In support, Wi-LAN ar gues that the Court misapprehended the \nappropriate start and end dates for the period of attorneys\u2019 fees, as well as other facts relevant to \nits decision to award fees.  ( See id.  at 2-8) \nPreviously, the Court determined that th is case was exceptional based on Wi-LAN\u2019s \nconduct with respect to the \u2019654 patent after April 26, 2018 \u2013 when Wi-LAN obtained the last of 3 the foreign third party \u201csystem-on-chip\u201d (\u201cSoC\u201d ) manufacturers\u2019 declarations \u2013 through the \nCourt\u2019s entry of final judgment for Defendants as to the \u2019654 patent on September 12, 2019.  \n(See D.I. 565 at 9)  In Wi-LAN\u2019s view, a more a ppropriate window of time  (even on the Court\u2019s \nreasoning) is between December 19, 2018 \u2013 whe n, during oral argument on their summary \njudgment motion, Defendants purportedly first \u201ccha llenge[d] the admissibility of the source code \nand SoC declarations (as a whol e)\u201d \u2013 and the Court\u2019s entry of  summary judgment on February \n14, 2019.2  (D.I. 567 at 1)  The Court agrees with part of Wi-LAN\u2019s analysis.    \nAs to the appropriate start date, Wi-LAN\u2019s ar guments are unpersuasive.  In identifying \nthe date by which Wi-LAN should not have cont inued to assert the \u2019654 patent, the Court \nexplained that, although \u201cmultiple da tes could be justified based on the evidence,\u201d the date it had \n\u201cdetermined is most fair to us e is April 26, 2018.\u201d  (D.I. 565 at 7)  The Court\u2019s view remains \nunchanged.  As Defendants note, Wi-LAN contends  that liability for its conduct should only \nattach \u201cwhen Defendants point ou t what Wi-LAN already knew or must have known.\u201d  (D.I. \n572 at 8)  This approach lacks me rit, both in the contex t of this case and as a broader principle.  \n(See id. ) (\u201cWi-LAN\u2019s approach would . . . undermine [the fee awar d\u2019s] purpose [of deterrence] \nby providing litigants an incentive to knowingly engage in baseless litigation maneuvers and \nwait and see if their opponents spend vast sums to  try to knock back eac h meritless approach.\u201d) \nWi-LAN is correct that, by April 26, 2018, De fendants had not yet filed a motion for \nsummary judgment raising ad missibility challenges.  ( See D.I. 567 at 2)  But Wi-LAN\u2019s \nsuggestion that it \u201chad no way of grasping that its source-code  evidence might be inadmissible \nuntil Defendants raised the issue\u201d is wrong.  (D.I. 572 at 5)  Instea d, the record establishes that \n \n2 Alternatively, Wi-LAN proposes a start date of  October 23, 2018, when De fendants filed their \nmotion for summary judgment of noni nfringement.  (D.I. 567 at 4 n.1, 8) 4 Wi-LAN knew or should have known by that date that it did not have sufficient admissible \nevidence to sustain its burden on infringeme nt.  As the Court has noted, Wi-LAN understood \nearly in this case that to prove direct infringe ment, it would need source  code from third-party \nSoC manufacturers for the period of 2009 to 2017.  ( See, e.g. , D.I. 565 at 4)  By April 26, 2018, \nWi-LAN knew that the best evidence it could obta in was a single version of source code from \n2017 and accompanying declarations stating that there are no material di fferences between that \nversion of the code and any versions used through 2009.  ( See id. at 6-7)  And Wi-LAN \nlikewise knew by then that it proba bly could not get even this limited evidence admitted at trial. \nAs Defendants have noted, the declarations  could not \u201csubstitute for Wi-LAN actually \nobtaining code going back to 2009 (which it admitted ly did not do).\u201d  (D.I. 332 at 2)  Further, \nMediaTek \u2013 whose chips accounted for \u201csomething in the order of 92 percent of the [accused] \nchips,\u201d according to Defendants (D.I. 572 Ex. 1 at 50;  see also D.I. 418 at 1 (referring to \nMediaTek as \u201cthe dominant SoC manufacturer\u201d)) \u2013 told Wi-LAN in  April 2017 that it could not \nproduce anyone who could state under oath that there are no \u201cmaterial differences\u201d among the \nchips manufactured over a period of  nearly eight years (D.I. 5 47-1 Ex. 2 at 3).  Moreover, \nalmost all of the declarations were obtained be fore the Court issued it s claim construction order \nin this case, raising the question of how the declarants (or anyone) could have known what \ndistinctions were \u201cmaterial.\u201d  ( See D.I. 565 at 7-8)   \nAs Defendants noted well before filing th eir summary judgment motion, Wi-LAN faced \nan \u201cinsurmountable\u201d failure of pr oof with respect to the \u2019654 pate nt.  (D.I. 332 at 2)  It was \nunreasonable for Wi-LAN to think it could overcome this failure with just  one version of source \ncode and unreliable declarations from decl arants who would not appear at trial.  \nAs the Court already concluded, these facts, as  well as the apparent lack of any viable 5 strategy by Wi-LAN with respect to admissibility, provide am ple support for the Court\u2019s \nconclusion that April 26, 2018 is the most appropriat e start date for the peri od of attorneys\u2019 fees.  \n(See D.I. 565 at 7-8)        \nFurther, the Court agrees with Defendants th at, as to the appropriate start date, Wi-LAN \n\u201cmerely disagree[s] with the Court\u2019s r easoning,\u201d and has not \u201cdemonstrate[ed] a \nmisapprehension of facts or the law.\u201d  (D.I. 572 at  2-3)  This provides further support for the \nCourt\u2019s decision to deny the requ est for reconsideration of this  aspect of its Order.    \nAs to the appropriate end date, on reconsid eration the Court agr ees with Wi-LAN that \nduring the period between the Court\u2019s entry of summa ry judgment and its entry of final judgment \nas to the \u2019654 patent, \u201c[t]here was no perpet uation of the \u2018exceptional\u2019 conduct found by the \nCourt.\u201d  (D.I. 567 at 5)  While Defendants are co rrect that, during that time, they incurred costs \nas they prepared briefing relate d to final judgment on the \u2019654 pa tent, at that time the parties \nwere \u201csimply engaged in disput es as to how exactly to reso lve the underlying case prior to \nappeal.\u201d  ( Id.)  Having reconsidered the i ssue, the Court finds it made an error of apprehension; \nit overlooked the fact that there is no causa l connection between Wi-LAN\u2019s misconduct and the \nfees expended by Defendants between  February 14, 2019 and September 12, 2019.  See \ngenerally Glendon Energy , 836 F. Supp. at 1122 (\u201c[A] motion fo r reconsideration addresses . . . \nfactual . . . matters that the Court may have overlooked . . . .\u201d).  Given the absence of \nmisconduct during that period (i.e ., February to September 2019), the parties \u2013 reasonably \u2013 did \nnot focus on it during briefing and argument.  No r did the Court.  Relatedly, the Court does not \nview Wi-LAN\u2019s argument relating to this peri od as one that \u201cshould have been presented\u201d \npreviously, Karr , 768 F. Supp. at 1093, as it did not beco me particularly relevant until after  the \nCourt issued its Order establishing the pertinent window of time.   6 Upon reconsideration, th e record does not reveal any conduct by Wi-LAN after February \n14, 2019 that the Court should be seeking to deter.  Therefore, the Court exercises its discretion \nto modify its Order and sets the end date for th e period of attorneys\u2019 f ees to February 14, 2019, \nthe date it entered summary judgm ent in favor of Defendants.  See In re Rembrandt Techs. LP \nPat. Litig. , 899 F.3d 1254, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]he am ount of the award must bear some \nrelation to the extent of the misconduct.\u201d). \nWi-LAN argues the Court misapp rehended other facts relevant  to its decision even to \naward any attorneys\u2019 fees.  ( See D.I. 567 at 6-8)  For example,  in Wi-LAN\u2019s view, the Court\u2019s \nfindings as to the unreliability of the SoC declarations and so urce code do not apply to the \nevidence Wi-LAN obtained from Sigma Designs (\u201cSigma\u201d).  ( Id. at 6)  As Defendants point \nout, however, even if this were true, \u201cSigma manufactured at mo st one chip, and there can be no \ncredible claim that advancing a case when Wi-LAN knew it could not prove infringement for \ndozens of chips and millions of televisions wa s anything but exceptional.\u201d  (D.I. 572 at 9)  \nSince the other third-party SoC manufacturers acc ounted for virtually all of  the chips at issue, \nWi-LAN\u2019s arguments as to Sigma do not render this case non-exceptional.  ( See id.)     \nWi-LAN next argues that, in addition to the SoC declarations and source code, it also \nrelied on separate, admissible te sting testimony from its expert, Dr . Ionut Mirel, to demonstrate \ninfringement.  ( See D.I. 567 at 7)  This argument fails  for the same reason as Wi-LAN\u2019s \narguments regarding Sigma: the te sting, at best, might establish a small portion of the alleged \ninfringement.  ( See D.I. 572 at 10)  Wi-LAN knew from the st art that it could not rely solely on \ntesting to prove the full scope of  the infringement allegations it always insisted this case was \nabout.  ( See id. ) \nRelatedly, Wi-LAN claims it could have proven infringe ment based on Dr. Mirel\u2019s 7 review of the native source code and declarations from software engineers with knowledge of the \ncode.  ( See D.I. 567 at 7)  Wi-LAN argues that the fa cts relied on by Dr. Mirel were \u201cof a type \nreasonably relied upon by expe rts in the field.\u201d  ( Id.)  As both this Court and the Federal Circuit \nhave explained, however, Wi-LAN did not show that source code experts reasonably rely on \nunauthenticated source code.  See Wi-LAN Inc. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp. , 992 F.3d 1366, 1376 \n(Fed. Cir. 2021); D.I. 487 at 9-10.  \nIn sum, the Court concludes that this case was exceptional based on Wi-LAN\u2019s conduct \nwith respect to the \u2019654 pate nt during the period of April 26, 2018 through February 14, 2019.  \nTurning next to the appropriate amount of fees to order Wi-LAN to pay Defendants, the \nCourt has considered Wi-LAN\u2019s obj ections to the fees sought by De fendants (consistent with the \nCourt\u2019s February 3, 2022 Order) ( see D.I. 566) and Defendants\u2019 responses ( see D.I. 570).  Wi-\nLAN primarily objects to Defendants\u2019 use of De fendants\u2019 attorneys\u2019 actual billed rates to \ncalculate the total requested fe e award of over $4.2 million.  (D.I. 566 at 1)  Wi-LAN urges the \nCourt instead to use an hourly rate of $500 to calculate the prope r lodestar amount \u2013 that is, \u201ca \nreasonable hourly rate [multipl ied] by the reasonable number of  hours required to litigate a \ncomparable case.\u201d  Lumen View Tech. LLC v. Findthebest.com,  Inc., 811 F.3d 479, 483 (Fed. \nCir. 2016).  Relying on excerpts from the American Intellectua l Property Law Association\u2019s \n(\u201cAIPLA\u201d) 2019 Report of the Economic Survey , Wi-LAN estimates that Philadelphia IP \nattorneys, on average, billed approximatel y $490 per hour during the relevant period.  ( See D.I. \n566 at 2) (citing D.I. 566-1 at 5-6)  Further,  according to AIPLA\u2019s 2019 Report, a total award of \nnearly $2.9 million that would result from applying an hourly rate of $500 is more consistent \nwith the cost of typical patent li tigation during the relevant period.  ( See id. ) (citing D.I. 566-1 at \n4) 8 Defendants respond that the AIPLA materials on which Wi-LAN relies are not reliable, \nfor reasons including that they contain hearsay.3  (D.I. 570 at 3, 5)  The Court agrees with \nDefendants that Wi-LAN has not established th at $500 was the prevailing market rate for \nPhiladelphia.  ( See id.  at 3)  More importantly, the ra te proposed by Wi-LAN does not account \nfor the skill and experience of De fendants\u2019 actual atto rneys or the other ci rcumstances of this \ncase.  ( See id. at 3-4) \nIn the Court\u2019s view, the more appropriate hour ly rates to apply are the actual rates paid \nby Defendants for Defendants\u2019 attorneys\u2019 work in defe ating Wi-LAN\u2019s accusations.4  (See id.  at \n4)  The Federal Circuit has explicitly approved the award of attorney fees under \u00a7 285 at the \nrates that the attorneys actually charged.  SRI Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc. , 930 F.3d 1295, 1311 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019) (\u201cWe take no issue with the dist rict court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees at the \nattorneys\u2019 billing rates without adjusting them to  Delaware rates.\u201d).  Here, Defendants, faced \nwith serious allegations of patent infringement  (and large alleged da mages), retained highly \nexperienced patent litigators, w ho billed based on their expertise and the specific circumstances \nof this case (including, for exam ple, a 10% discount for Shar p from Kirkland & Ellis, which \nobtained the representation following a competitive bidding process).  See, e.g. , Gloucester \n \n3 Other issues Defendants identify with Wi -LAN\u2019s reliance on AIPLA\u2019s 2019 Report include: \nthe data was derived from an e-ma il invitation to participate in a survey that yielded only an \n11.1% response rate, and the average billing ra tes from the \u201cPhiladelphia CMSA\u201d region appear \nto be based on information collect ed from only four firms, \u201cwith no explanation of their relative \nsize or the experience and expertise of the attorneys that alle gedly responded.\u201d  (D.I. 570 at 3) \n(citing D.I. 570-1 Ex. 3 at 1, F-22)  \n4 Defendants note that, although the Third Circuit ha s not yet ruled on this issue, other circuits \nhave recognized that an attorney\u2019s actual bil ling rate is presumptivel y reasonable if it is \ncomparable to rates provided fo r similar services performed by similarly skilled and experienced \nattorneys.  (D.I. 570 at 4) (citing Jeffboat, LLC v. Dir., Off. of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs , 553 \nF.3d 487, 490 (7th Cir. 2009); Woodland v. Viacom Inc. , 255 F.R.D. 278, 280-81 (D.D.C. 2008)) 9 Cnty. Improvement Auth. v. Gallenthin Realty Dev., Inc. , 2011 WL 3328474, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. \n1, 2011).  Further, relying on the 2019 Valeo Part ners LLC\u2019s Attorney Hourly Rate Report ( see \nD.I. 570-1 Exs. 13-15), Defendants have shown th eir rates are comparable to the prevailing \nmarket rate \u201cfor similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and \nreputation.\u201d  Blum v. Stenson , 465 U.S. 886, 895 n.11 (1984); see also  Regeneron Pharms., Inc. \nv. Merus N.V. , 2018 WL 3425013, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. June 25, 2018) (finding Kirkland\u2019s rates for \nIP litigation reasonable). \nAdditionally, and importantly, this Court re mains of the view that the appropriate \n\u201cmarket\u201d for assessing rates in a high-stakes patent litigation like the instant case is the market \nfor national (and Delaware) counsel who litigate patent cases in Delaware.  See, e.g. , Belcher \nPharms., LLC v. Hospira, Inc. , 2022 WL 606075, at *5 (D. Del. Fe b. 3, 2022) (\u201c[I]n my view, \nthe relevant market here is the market for national counsel that pr actices patent litigation in the \nDistrict of Delaware.\u201d).  The Court simply disagrees with Wi-LAN\u2019s contention that the only \nproper comparators for all patent litigators practicing in this Court are Delaware lawyers (or even \nlawyers in the broader \u201cP hiladelphia\u201d market). \nFor these reasons, the Court finds Defendants\u2019  actually charged rates are reasonable and \napplicable.   \nWi-LAN also argues that Defendants do not spec ify in their time entries how particular \nwork related to the \u2019654 patent , and requests that the Court or der Defendants to provide more \ndetailed descriptions.  (D.I. 566 at 2-3)  Wi -LAN, however, does not provide any significant \ndetail as to the entries it claims lack sufficient detail.  Defendants  have already agreed to remove \nthe few entries Wi-LAN did identify as being unr elated to the \u2019654 patent.  (D.I. 570 at 2) \nThe Court further finds that Defendants have made a good faith effort to comply with the 10 Court\u2019s February 3, 2022 Order.5  Defendants explain that \u201ctime entries that pertained to the \n\u2019250 patent were removed in their entirety, and where time entries rela ted to both the \u2019654 and \n\u2019250 patents, the \u2019250 patent portions were remo ved and the entries were reduced accordingly.\u201d  \n(Id.)  Defendants further point out that no time entries relate to the \u2019774 patent, as that patent \nwas dismissed from the case before April 26, 2018, the start date for the period of attorneys\u2019 fees \nbeing awarded.  ( Id.)  Based on this record, and considerin g the fact that th e Court need not \nengage in a \u201ctedious, line-by-line investig ation of the hours [Def endants] expended,\u201d In re \nRembrandt , 899 F.3d at 1280, Wi-LAN\u2019s request that Defendants provide more detailed \ndescriptions as to their entries is denied.  \nAccordingly, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that: \n1. Wi-LAN\u2019s objections (D.I. 566) are OVERRULED . \n2. No later than April 27, 2022 , the parties shall submit a proposed order, consistent \nwith this ruling, that identifies the amount of fees to be awarde d to Defendants, which shall be \nadjusted to reflect the narrower window of time set out in this  Order.  The submitted order \nshould be one the Court can sign an d conclude this case and put it in a posture where one or both \nsides could, if it choos es, take an appeal. \n3. Because this Memorandum Order is file d under seal, the parties shall meet and \nconfer and, no later than 3:00 p.m. on April 26, 2022 , submit a proposed redacted version, \naccompanied by a supporting memorandum detailing how, under applicable law, the Court may  \n  \n \n5 By contrast, Wi-LAN appears to have dodged Defenda nts\u2019 efforts to meet and confer ahead of \nfiling its objections.

In the absenc e of a timely, complian t request, the Court will \nunseal the entire Order. \n    \n________________________________ \nApril 25, 2022      HONORABLE LEONARD P.
