Action No. 18-387-CFC \n) \n) \n) \n) \nKendall Maurice Smith, Ill, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware. \nPro Se Plaintiff. \nZi-Xiang Shen, Deputy Attorney General, Delaware Department of Justice, Wilmington, \nDelaware. Counsel for Defendant Katrina Burley. \nMarch 7, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Kendall Maurice Smith, Ill, an inmate at the James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center (\"JTVCC\") in Smyrna, Delaware, filed this lawsuit pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of his constitutional rights. (D.I. 2, 10)1 He appears \nprose and was granted permission to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915. Pending is Defendant Katrina Burley's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff's \nopposition, and Defendant's motion to strike.2 (D.I. 73, 82, 83) \nI. BACKGROUND AND FACTS AS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES \nPlaintiff alleges that he suffered for a number of years due to extreme delay and \ndenial of medical treatment related to his eyes, vision, and prescription glasses. (D.I. 2, \n10) Upon screening, the Court liberally construed the allegations and allowed Plaintiff \nto proceed on what appeared to be cognizable medical needs claims related to \nGrievance 334538 submitted by Plaintiff on April 10, 2016. (See D.I. 11, 12) All other \nclaims were dismissed. (/d.) Plaintiff alleges that on May 6, 2016 his grievance was \nheard by a grievance committee comprised of the now dismissed medical defendants \nand Burley, the only remaining Defendant. The grievance committee granted in part \nand denied in part Grievance 334538. \nBurley has served as an inmate grievance chairperson (\"IGC\") at JTVCC since \nNovember 2015, and in that position she reviews and processes inmate grievances \npursuant to institutional grievance policies and procedures . (D.I. 76 at 67) Her duties \n1 The case proceeds on the original complaint at Docket Items 2 and 10. (See D.I. 59). \n2 Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff's response to the motion for summary judgment as \nuntimely and unresponsive. (D.I. 83) The Court will deny the motion and will consider \nPlaintiff's response . include collecting inmates grievances, forwarding the grievances to the appropriate \nstaff, scheduling and facilitating grievance hearings, and communicating decisions to \ninmates. (Id. at 67) Burley is present at medical grievances hearings for security \npurposes and to collect paperwork from the Medical Grievance Committee (\"MGC\"). \n(Id. at 68) She is not a member of the MGC and does not vote on whether to uphold or \ndeny an inmate's medical grievance. (Id.) She has never voted on a medical grievance \nand she is recorded as an \"abstain from vote\" on all medical grievances. (Id.) Once \nthe MGC votes on a medical grievance Burley advises the inmate of the decision and \nprovides the inmate with the necessary paperwork to submit an appeal. (Id.) Burley is \nnot a medical professional, has no role in an inmate's medical care, and had no role in \nPlaintiff's medical care. (Id.) \nDelaware Department of Correction Policy Number A 11, 3 effective September 2, \n2015, governs the procedure for medical grievances following an inmate's timely \nsubmitted grievance. (Id. at 28-32) The policy prohibits inmates \"from submitting a \ngrievance before attempting to use the sick call request\" and submitting duplicative \ngrievances, and requires inmates to submit a completed grievance form \"within 7 \ncalendar days of the incident, i.e. after the Sick Call appointment.\" (Id. at 29 at ,r VI.B.) \nUpon receipt of a properly submitted grievance, a three-step process is followed. \nStep 1 provides for informal resolution. (Id. at 29-30) When an inmate rejects \nthe informal resolution within the required time-frame, the grievance proceeds to Step 2. \n3 The policy falls under the Bureau of Correctional Healthcare Services. \n2 (Id. at 30 at 11 VI.E.3.) At Step 2, the IGC (i.e., Defendant) forwards the grievance to the \nMGC, which conducts a hearing on the grievance within 30 days of the inmate's \nrejection. (Id. at 11 VI.F.2.) The MGC is comprised of three medical staff members, at \nleast one of whom is a licensed nursing professional. (Id.) The IGC is required to attend \nthe hearing and record the hearing information. (Id.) Upon review, the MGC decides \nwhether to deny or uphold the grievance. (Id.) \nStep 3 is the formal appeal process. (Id. at 31) A Bureau of Correctional \nHealthcare Services employee who is designated as the Bureau Grievance Officer \n(\"BGO\") reviews the grievance and makes a recommendation to the Bureau Chief to \n\"direct[ ] additional investigation, uphold or deny the offender's remedy request, mak[e] \n[a] partial accommodation, or request an outside review.\" (Id.) The Bureau Chief \nmakes a final decision whether to accept or reject the BGO recommendation. (Id.) \nPlaintiff was prescribed glasses in 2013. (D.I. 2 at 5) On September 13, 2014, \nhe submitted a grievance for vision care and later abandoned the grievance. (Id. at 24-\n26) On November 2, 2015, Plaintiff submitted another grievance, No. 321826, \ncomplaining that he needed new glasses because his glasses had broken and their \nprescription was unsuitable. (Id. at 33, 38) In the meantime, on November 19, 2015, \nPlaintiff was seen by medical for vision issues. (Id. at 64) The MGC heard Plaintiffs \ngrievance on December 9, 2015, and denied it; IGC Burley was recorded as abstaining \nfrom the vote. (Id. at 35, 37) . The MGC noted that Plaintiff had not placed a sick call \nbefore submitting a grievance and instructed Plaintiff to use the sick call protocol. (Id. at \n3 37) Plaintiff stated that he wished to appeal the MGC's decision, but he did not. (Id. at \n36) \nOn March 29, 2016, Plaintiff was seen at medical, requested new glasses, and \nwas examined. (Id. at 62) On April 10, 2016, Plaintiff submitted Grievance No. \n334538,4 complained that the MGC denied Grievance 321826 in error, requested a \n$4.00 refund of a fee he paid for the March 2016 evaluation, and asked to see an \noptometrist. (Id. at 39, 45) At Step 1, a healthcare staff member instructed the \nfacility business office to refund Plaintiff the $4.00 fee for the March 2016 visit and \nreferred Plaintiff for a vision consultation. (Id. at 39) The grievance proceeded to a \nStep 2 hearing with the MGC (Id. at 39, 42) The MGC held a hearing on May 6, 2016, \nand upheld the remedy, with IGC Burley abstaining from the vote. (Id. at 41) Plaintiff \nappealed. (Id. at 41-42) \nOn June 14, 2016, Plaintiff underwent a two-year follow-up optometry \nexam. (Id. at 60-62) On June 22, 2016, the BGO recommended upholding the remedy \nthat Plaintiff receive a $4.00 refund and denying all other aspects of the grievance. (Id. \nat 43) The same day, the Bureau Chief issued a final decision that accepted the BGO's \nrecommendation. (Id. at 44) \nOn July 15, 2016, Plaintiff received new glasses. (Id. at 60) In late 2016 and \n2017 Plaintiff advised medical on numerous occasions that he had broken his glasses; \non each occasion, his glasses were either repaired or replaced. (Id. at 56, 57, 58, 65) \n4 The surviving medical needs claim is related to Grievance 334538. \n4 Plaintiff received new glasses on March 5, 2018, and filed this action on March 12, \n2018. (D.I. 2; D.I. 76 at 56) \nBurley moves for summary judgment on the grounds that: (1) the claims are time\u00ad\nbarred; (2) Plaintiff fails to show Burley's personal involvement; (3) Plaintiff fails to \nestablish an Eighth Amendment violation; and (4) the claims are barred by Burley's \nqualified immunity. (D.I. 74) \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA court must grant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of any genuine issues of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). If the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the \nnon-moving party, then the moving party may satisfy its burden of production by \npointing to an absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case, after which \nthe burden of production then shifts to the non-movant to demonstrate the existence of \na genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 \nU.S. 574, 586-87 (1986); Williams v. Borough of West Chester, Pa., 891 F.2d 458, 460-\n61 (3d Cir. 1989). \nMaterial facts are those \"that could affect the outcome\" of the proceeding. \nLamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011). \"[A] dispute about a material \nfact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict \nfor the non-moving party.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). A non-moving party \n5 asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must support such an assertion by: \"(A) citing \nto particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, \nelectronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, ... admissions, \ninterrogatory answers, or other materials; or (B) showing that the materials cited [by the \nopposing party] do not establish the absence ... of a genuine dispute .... \" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(c)(1). The non-moving party's evidence \"must amount to more than a \nscintilla, but may amount to less (in the evaluation of the court) than a preponderance.\" \nWilliams, 891 F.2d at 460-61. \nThe court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Wishkin v. Potter, 476 \nF.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). \"[T]he facts asserted by the nonmoving party, if supported \nI \nby affidavits or other evidentiary material, must be regarded as true .... \" Aman v. Cort \nFurniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, 1080 (3d Cir. 1996). If \"there is any evidence in \nthe record from any source from which a reasonable inference in the [nonmoving \nparty's] favor may be drawn, the moving party simply cannot obtain a summary \njudgment.\" Id. \nIll. DISCUSSION \nBurley moves for summary judgment on a number of grounds. The Court turns \nfirst to the case dispositive issue of Burley's personal involvement. Burley argues that \nPlaintiff has failed to establish her personal involvement as required to impose liability \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Plaintiff responds that there is a \"causal link\" between the \n6 actions of Burley and the challenged conduct and that Burley confirmed her personal \ninvolvement and responsibility in her declaration. \nThe Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment \nobligates jail authorities to provide medical care to inmates. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 \nU.S. 97, 103 (1976); Rouse v. Plantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999). In order to \nestablish an Eighth Amendment medical claim, an inmate must allege acts or omissions \nby prison officials sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to a serious \nmedical need. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 235-36 (3d Cir. 2004); Natale v. \nCamden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 582 (3d Cir. 2003). In the context of medical \ncare, the relevant inquiry is whether the defendant was: (1) deliberately indifferent (the \nsubjective component) to (2) the plaintiff's serious medical needs (the objective \ncomponent). See Monmouth Cty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326,346 (3d \nCir. 1987); West v. Keve, 571 F.2d 158, 161 (3d Cir. 1979). A non-physician defendant \ncannot be considered deliberately indifferent for failing to respond to an inmate's \nmedical complaints when the inmate is already receiving treatment by the prison's \nmedical staff. See Durmer v. O'Carroll, 991 F.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993). \nLiability in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action is personal in nature; to be liable, a \ndefendant must have been personally involved in the wrongful conduct. In other words, \na defendant is \"liable only for [his] own unconstitutional conduct. Barkes v. First Corr. \nMed., Inc., 766 F.3d 307,316 (3d Cir. 2014), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Tay/orv. \nBarkes, 575 U.S. 822 (2015). \"Personal involvement can be shown through allegations \nof personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence. And a defendant's \n7 knowledge of a risk to health and safety 'can be proved indirectly by circumstantial \nevidence to the effect that the excessive risk was so obvious that the official must have \nknown of the risk.,,, Thomas v. Tice, 948 F .3d 133, 138 (3d Cir. 2020) ( citations \nomitted). \nNothing in the record evidence shows or suggests that Burley was personally \ninvolved in the medical needs claim raised by Plaintiff or that Burley was deliberately \nindifferent to his serious medical needs. Rather, the record evidence makes clear that \nBurley, a non-medical professional, is tasked with administrative duties as an \ninstitutional grievance chairperson. Those duties require her to be present at MGC \nhearings for security purposes and to collect paperwork. She is not a member of the \nMGC and she does not vote on medical grievances. Nor does she provide medical care \nto inmates. There is no record evidence that Plaintiff ever sought medical care from \nBurley. Moreover, Plaintiff's medical records indicate that he is provided medical care \nfor his vision issues. There is nothing in the record that indicates Burley was \ndeliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's medical needs. In short, no reasonable jury could \nfind for Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court will grant her motion for summary judgment. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Burley's motion for summary \njudgment (D.I. 73); and (2) deny Burlets motion to strike (D.I. 83). \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n8 "}
