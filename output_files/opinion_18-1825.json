ANDERSON, \nPetitioner, \nV. \nROBERT MAY, Warden,1 and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELA WARE, \nRespondents . Civil Action No. 18-1825-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nNathaniel R. Anderson . Pro se Petitioner. \nKathryn J. Garrison, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice, \nWilmington, Delaware. Attorney for Respondents . \nJanuary 10, 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n1 Warden Robert May replaced former Warden Dana Metzger, an original party to this case. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). A~, {,TATES DISTRICT JUDGE: \nPetitioner Nathaniel R. Anderson is an inmate in custody at the James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware. Petitioner filed an Application for a Writ of Habeas \nCorpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\"Petition\"). (D.I. 1) The State filed a Motion to Dismiss \n(D.I. 14), and Petitioner filed a Response in opposition (D.I. 17). For the reasons discussed, the \nCourt will grant the State's Motion to Dismiss, and deny the Petition as barred by the limitations \nperiod prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn July 1994, a Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of two counts of first degree \nunlawful sexual intercourse. See State v. Anderson, 1998 WL 1029252, at * 1 (Del. Super. Ct. \nSept. 29, 1998). The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner on October 7, 1994 to a total of fifty \nyears at Level V, including credit for 102 days already served. (D.I. 8-20 at 3) see State v. \nAnderson, 1999 WL 743448, at * 1 (Del. Super. Ct. July 7, 1999)). On May 16, 1995, the \nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner 's convictions and sentence on direct appeal. See \nAnderson v. State, 660 A.2d 393 (Table), 1995 WL 330821, at *2 (Del. May 16, 1995). \nPetitioner appealed the Delaware Supreme Court's decision to that same court (D.I. 8-6), which \ndismissed the appeal because it did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal of its own decision. \n(D.I. 8-7) \nOn April 20, 1998, Petitioner filed in the Superior Court a motion for postconviction \nrelief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\"). (D.I. 8-20 at \n6, Entry No. 29) The Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on September 29, 1998, and \nPetitioner did not appeal that decision. (D.I. 8-20 at 7, Entry No. 37; see Anderson, 1998 WL \n1029252, at *2). On December 10, 1998, Petitioner filed a second Rule 61 motion, which the Superior \nCourt denied on July 7, 1999. (D.I. 8-20 at 7, Entry No. 40; see State v. Anderson, 1999 WL \n743448, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. July 7, 1999)). Petitioner appealed, and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt affirmed the Superior Court's decision on May 8, 2000. See Anderson v. State, 755 A.2d \n386 (Table), 2000 WL 949615, at *2 (Del. May 8, 2000). \nPetitioner filed a third Rule 61 motion on May 30, 2002, which the Superior Court. \nsummarily dismissed on June 13, 2002. (D.I. 8-20 at 8, Entry Nos. 50, 51; see State v. Anderson, \n2002 WL 1335494, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. June 13, 2002)). The Delaware Supreme Court \naffirmed the Superior Court's judgment on August 28, 2002. See Anderson v. State, 804 A.2d \n1065 (Table), 2002 WL 2009111, at * 1 (Del. Aug. 28, 2002). \nIn December 2008, Petitioner filed a motion for modification of sentence, which the \nSuperior Court denied in February, 2009. (D.I. 8-20 at 8-9, Entry Nos. 55, 56) Petitioner did not \nappeal that decision. \nPetitioner filed a fourth Rule 61 motion on May 21, 2012. (D.I. 8-20 at 9, Entry No. 57) \nThe Superior Court denied the Rule 61 motion on November 5, 2012. (D.I. 8-20 at 10, Entry No. \n67) Petitioner did not appeal that decision. \nPetitioner filed a fifth Rule 61 motion on October 5, 2015. (D.I. 8-20 at 11, Entry No. \n72) The Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner on January 6, 2016. (D.I. 8-20 \nat 11, Entry No. 76) Post-conviction counsel filed a motion to withdraw, and the Superior Court \ngranted counsel's motion to withdraw and denied the Rule 61 motion on April 21, 2017. (Id. at \n12, Entry Nos. 83, 85) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision on \n2 February 8, 2018. See Anderson v. State, 180 A.3d 43 (Table), 2018 WL 826037, at *2 (Del. \nFeb. 8, 2018). \nPetitioner filed the instant Petition in November 2018, which appears to assert two \ngrounds, one alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel2 and one alleging that the trial court \ndenied Petitioner his rights to due process and equal protection by failing to appoint counsel to \nrepresent Petitioner in his first Rule 61 proceeding . (D.I. 1) \nII. ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATI ONS \nAEDP A prescribes a one-year period of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions by \nstate prisoners, which begins to run from the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion \nof direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such \nreview; \n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application \ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of \nthe United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from \nfiling by such State action; \n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially \nrecognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly \nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively \napplicable to cases on collateral review; or \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims \npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due \ndiligence . \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l). AEDPA's limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling. \nSee Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) \n(statutory tolling). \n2 The ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument is a combination of what Petitioner lists at \nGrounds One and Three in his Petition. \n3 Petitioner does not assert, and the Court cannot discern, any facts triggering the \napplication of\u00a7 2244( d)(l )(B),(C), or (D). Therefore, the one-year period of limitations began to \nrun when Petitioner's conviction became final under\u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A). Pursuant to\u00a7 \n2244( d)(l )(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment but does not seek certiorari \nreview, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the statute of limitations begins to run, \nupon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed for seeking certiorari review. See Jones v. \nMorton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir. 1999); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565,575,578 (3d \nCir. 1999). Here, Petitioner's judgment of conviction became final on August 14, 1995, ninety \ndays after the Delaware Supreme Court's May 16, 1995 decision affirming his convictions and \nsentences. However, because Petitioner's conviction became final prior to AEDPA's effective \ndate of April 24, 1996, he benefits from a one-year grace period for timely filing habeas \npetitions, thereby extending the filing period through April 23, 1997.3 See McAleese v. Brennan, \n483 F.3d 206,213 (3d Cir. 2007); Douglas v. Horn, 359 F.3d 257, 261 (3d Cir. 2004). Thus, \nPetitioner had until April 23, 1997 to timely file his Petition. \nPetitioner, however, did not file the instant Petition until November 20, 2018,4 which is \nmore than twenty-one years after the expiration of the limitations period. Therefore, his habeas \n3 Many federal circuit courts have held that the one-year grace period for petitioners whose \nconvictions became final prior to the enactment of AEDPA ends on April 24, 1997, not April 23, \n1997. See Patterson v. Stewart, 251 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2001)(collecting cases). Although \nthe Third Circuit has noted that \"[a]rguably we should have used April 24, 1997, rather than \nApril 23, 1997, as the cut-off date,\" Douglas, 359 F.3d at 261 n.5 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(d)), it \nappears that April 23, 1997 is still the relevant cut-off date in this circuit. In the present \nsituation, however, Petitioner filed his petition well-past either cut-off date, rendering the one\u00ad\nday difference immaterial. \n4 Petitioner electronically filed the instant Petition on November 20, 2018, but the Petition itself \nis dated November 23, 2018 (D.I. 1 at 15). Since the three-day difference does not affect the \nCourt's decision to dismiss the Petition, the Court will treat the earlier date as the date of filing. \n4 Petition is untimely, unless the limitations period can statutorily or equitably tolled. See Jones, \n195 F.3d at 158. The Court will discuss each doctrine in turn. \nA. Statutory Tolling \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244( d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDP A's \nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post\u00ad\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of \nAEDPA's limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). The \nlimitations period is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction \ndecision could be filed even if the appeal is not eventually filed. Id. at 424. The limitations \nperiod, however, is not tolled during the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state post\u00ad\nconviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att 'y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d Cir. 2001). \nThe limitations clock in this case started to run on April 24, 1996, and ran without \ninterruption until it expired on April 24, 1997. None of Petitioner's Rule 61 motions statutorily \ntoll the limitations period because he filed all five of those motions after April 24, 1997.5 \nAccordingly, the instant Petition is time-barred, unless equitable tolling applies. \nB. Equitable Tolling \nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare circumstances \nwhen the petitioner demonstrates \"(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that \nsome extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\" Holland, 560 \n5The petition for writ of mandamus that Petitioner filed on January 9, 1997 (D.I. 8-8) -which \nPetitioner withdrew on January 22, 1997 (D.I. 8-20 at 6)-does not toll the limitations period \nbecause it did not constitute an application for collateral review. Rather, the mandamus petition \nsought to force the Superior Court to provide Petitioner with a copy of the indictment. \n5 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the \nlate filing is due to the petitioner's excusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary \ncircumstance requirement, \"the relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be \nextraordinary is unique to the petitioner , but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to \nmeeting AEDPA's one-year deadline.\" Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385,401 (3d Cir. 2011). \nNotably, an extraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling ifthere is \"a causal \nconnection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner's failure to \nfile a timely federal petition.\" Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). \nPetitioner appears to assert that the limitations period should be equitably tolled under \nMartinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012) because the Superior Court did not appoint counsel to \nrepresent him in his first Rule 61 proceeding. (D.I. 17 at 2) This argument is unavailing. By its \nown terms, the Martinez decision provides a petitioner with an opportunity to overcome a \nprocedural default of an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, but does not in any way \nimpact a petitioner's obligation to comply with AEDPA's limitations period. \nPetitioner does not assert that any other alleged extraordinary circumstance prevented \nhim from timely filing the instant Petition. To the extent Petitioner's late filing was due to a \nmistake or miscalculation of the one-year filing period, such a mistake does not warrant \nequitably tolling the limitations period. See Taylor v. Carroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. \nDel. May 14, 2004). For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that the doctrine of equitable \ntolling is not available to Petitioner on the facts he has presented. Accordingly, the Court will \ngrant the State's Motion to Dismiss the Petition as time-barred. \n6 IV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether \nto issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2 ). \nWhen a district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the \nunderlying constitutional claims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability \nunless the petitioner demonstrates that jurists ofreason would find it debatable: (1) whether the \npetition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was \ncorrect in its procedural ruling. See Slack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473,484 (2000). \nThe Court concludes that the instant Petition is time-barred. In the Court's view, \nreasonable jurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Therefore , the Court will not \nissue a certificate of appealability. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed , the Court will grant the State's Motion to Dismiss and will \ndismiss the Petition as time-barred . \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n7 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nNATHANIEL R. ANDERSON , \nPetitioner, \nV. \nROBERT MAY, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE , \nRespondents. Civil Action No. 18-1825-RGA \nORDER \nAt Wilmington , this 10th day of January, 2022, for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum Opinion issued this date; \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. The State's Motion to Dismiss Petitioner Nathaniel R. Anderson's Petition for \na Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 as time-barred (D.I. 14) is GRANTED. \n2. Petitioner 's\u00a7 2254 Petition (D.I. 1) is DISMISSED, and the reliefrequested \ntherein is DENIED . \n3. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner has \nfailed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Clerk shall CLOSE the \ncase. "}
