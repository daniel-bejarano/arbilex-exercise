For the reasons set forth be low, the Court will deny Defendan t\u2019s motion to dismiss and its \nalternative request for a more definite statement. I.  BACKGROUND \n \nOn June 30, 2020, Plaintiffs sued Defendant in  the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of New York, allegi ng that Defendant infringed U. S. Patent Nos. 6,660,297 (the \u201c\u2019297 \npatent\u201d) and 8,603,522 (the \u201c\u2019522 patent\u201d).  ( Bausch & Lomb Inc. v. SBH Holdings LLC , C.A. \nNo. 6:20-cv-06451 (W.D.N.Y.) (the \u201cW.D.N.Y. Action\u201d) D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-32)  On October 1, 2020, \nDefendant filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3).  (W.D.N.Y. \nAction D.I. 8)  On November 2, 2020, Plaintif fs voluntarily dismissed the W.D.N.Y. Action \npursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) .  (W.D.N.Y. Action D.I. 11) \nOn October 28, 2020, Plaintiffs brought the inst ant action against Defendant for the same \npatent infringement cause of  action, alleging that Defendant  infringed the \u2019297 and the \u2019522 \npatents (the \u201cpatents-in-suit\u201d) by making, us ing, importing, offering to  sell, or selling \nMacularProtect\u00ae AREDS 2 and MacularProtect Complete\u00ae AREDS 2 (the \u201cMacularProtect\u00ae \nAREDS 2 products\u201d).  ( See D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, 28-30)  The pate nts-in-suit claim a formulation \ndosage of vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A in  the form of beta-car otene (substituted or \nsupplemented with lutein, zeaxanthine, or a comb ination thereof), zinc, and copper, as well as \nmethods for manufacturing the dosage form and methods for administering the dosage form.   2(See D.I. 13 at 3; see also  \u2019297 patent, cls. 1-3, 19, 25, 26, 31; \u2019522 patent, cls. 1, 8, 11, 16)  The \ncompositions of the claimed dosage form are expr essed both in absolute amounts and in relation \nto the U.S. recommended dietary allowance (\u201cRDA\u201d).   II.  LEGAL STANDARDS  A.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Proce dure 12(b)(6) requires \nthe Court to accept as true all materi al allegations of the complaint.  See Spruill v. Gillis , 372 \nF.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004).  \u201cThe issue is not wh ether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but \nwhether the claimant is entitled to of fer evidence to support the claims.\u201d  In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (inter nal quotation marks omitted).  \nThus, the Court may grant such a motion to di smiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well-pleaded \nallegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d  Maio v. Aetna, Inc. , 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) \n(internal quotati on marks omitted). \n However, \u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a ci vil plaintiff must allege  facts that \u2018raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level on the as sumption that the allega tions in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).\u2019\u201d  Victaulic Co. v. Tieman , 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  A cl aim is facially plausible \n\u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that a llows the court to draw the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009).  At bottom, \u201c[t]he comp laint must state enough facts to raise a reasonabl e expectation \nthat discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff\u2019s claim.   3Wilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter School Inc. , 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  The Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions,\u201d Morse v. Lower Merion \nSch. Dist. , 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201cunsupported \nconclusions and unwarranted inferences,\u201d Schuylkill Energy Res., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co. , \n113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations  that are \u201cself-evidently false,\u201d Nami v. Fauver , \n82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d Cir. 1996).  B. Rule 12(e) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) allo ws a party to move for a more definite \nstatement when a pleading is \u201cso vague or ambiguous that th e party cannot reasonably be \nrequired to frame a responsive pleading.\u201d  Schaedler v. Reading Eagle Publ\u2019n, Inc. , 370 F.2d \n795, 798 (3d Cir. 1967).  \u201cThe decision whether to grant or deny a defendant\u2019s motion for a more \ndefinite statement rests within th e sound discretion of the court.\u201d  Holmes v. Colonial Sch. Dist. , \n2010 WL 4918721, at *1 (D. Del. Nov. 24, 2010).  Moti ons for a more definite statement are \ngenerally viewed with disfavor, particularly \u201cw here the information s ought by the motion could \neasily be obtained by discovery.\u201d  CFMT, Inc. v. Yield Up Intern. Corp. , 1996 WL 33140642, at \n*1 (D. Del. Apr. 5, 1996).  III. DISCUSSION \n \nA. Motion To Dismiss \nDefendant first contends that Pl aintiffs fail to plead facts su fficient to state a plausible \npatent infringement claim, insisting that the co mplaint fails to \u201cidentify how the patent claims \nread on [D]efendant\u2019s products.\u201d  (D.I. 9 at 14)  In the Court\u2019s view, the facts pled in the \ncomplaint plausibly state an infringement claim.    4A complaint must include sufficient facts to \u201cplace the alleged infringer on notice of what \nactivity . . . is being ac cused of infringement.\u201d  Bot M8 LLC v. Sony Corp. of Am. , 4 F.4th 1342, \n1352 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (internal quota tion marks omitted).  Therefore,  a plaintiff cannot assert a \nplausible infringement claim by \u201creciting the claim elements a nd merely concluding that the \naccused product has those elements.\u201d  Id. at 1353.  However, a plaintiff is not required to \u201cplead \nfacts establishing that each element of an asserted claim is met.\u201d  Nalco Co. v. Chem-Mod, LLC , \n883 F.3d 1337, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  The level of detail required for th e complaint varies \n\u201cdepending upon a number of factors,  including the comp lexity of the technology, the materiality \nof any given element to practic ing the asserted claim(s), and the nature of the allegedly \ninfringing device.\u201d  Bot M8 , 4 F.4th at 1353. \nIn this case, Plaintiffs allege the followi ng facts to support their infringement claims: \nSBH is making, using, importing, of fering to sell, or selling \ncompositions containing a formul ation of lutein, zeaxanthin, \nvitamins C and E, zinc, and copper, that are specifically described \nand claimed in the [patents-in-su it], including but not limited to \nSBH\u2019s MacularProtect\u00ae AREDS 2 and MacularProtect Complete\u00ae AREDS 2 products (the \u201cMacularProtect\u00ae AREDS 2 products\u201d).  SBH is making, using, importing, offering to sell, or \nselling such compositions for the use in treating or preventing age-\nrelated eye disease or for maintaining or preserving eye health or vision, which infringe the claims  of the [patents-in-suit]. \n \nOn information and belief, SBH is selling, offering for sale and/or importing compositions with instru ctions for use and promotions \nthat cause and induce the user to  infringe the claims in the \u2019297 \nPatent, including but not limite d to SBH\u2019s MacularProtect\u00ae \nAREDS 2 products.  SBH is doing so with knowledge of the [patents-in-suit] and with specific intent that its customers will infringe the [patents-in-suit]. \n \nOn information and belief, SBH is selling, offering for sale and/or importing components or material s, knowing the same to be \nespecially made or especially adap ted for use in an infringement of \nthe [patents-in-suit]. \n  5(D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-17, 28-30) \n With respect to direct infringement, Plain tiffs have identified the accused products (\u201cthe \nMacularProtect\u00ae AREDS 2 products\u201d), described th e compositions of the accused products (\u201ca \nformulation of lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamins C an d E, zinc, and copper\u201d), and alleged that the \ncompositions were infringing because they cont ain a formulation disclo sed and claimed in the \npatents-in-suit.  ( See id. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28)  Plaintiffs also  attached the patents-in-s uit to the complaint.  \n(Id. Exs. A-C)  Considering that the technology does not appear to be complex and that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 infringement theory is straightforward, these factual al legations are sufficient to place \nDefendant on notice of the nature of the accused infringement.  See Disc Disease Sols. Inc. v. \nVGH Sols., Inc. , 888 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (fi nding plaintiff\u2019s infringement \nallegations sufficient when asserted patent \u201cinvolves a simple technology\u201d and complaint alleges that specifically named accused pr oducts meet \u201ceach and every elem ent of at least one claim\u201d of \nasserted patent); see also, e.g. , NNCrystal US Corp. v. Nanosys, Inc. , 2020 WL 616307, at *3 (D. \nDel. Feb. 10, 2020); Encoditech LLC v. Qardio, Inc. , 2019 WL 2526725, at *6 (D. Del. June 19, \n2019).\n1 \n \n1 Defendant directs the Court to Golden v. Apple Inc. , 819 F. App\u2019x 930 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  ( See \nD.I. 9 at 14-15)  In Golden , 819 F. App\u2019x at 931, as the Federa l Circuit pointed out, \u201c[t]he \ncomplaint itself offe rs only vague generalities and block quotes of statutes, cases and treatises, \nbut nowhere points us to any nonfri volous allegations of infringeme nt of any claim by any actual \nproduct made, used, or sold by any defendant.\u201d  The complaint here is not similarly deficient, as \nthe Court has explained.  \nIn Bot M8 , which was decided after the briefi ng was completed, the Federal Circuit \naffirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff failed to state a claim because the \nallegations that the authentication program is located on the PS4 motherboard were \u201c inconsistent  \nwith and contradict infringement,\u201d  as the asserted claim required  that the authentication program \nbe stored \u201cseparately from the motherboard.\u201d  See Bot M8 , 4 F.4th at 1354.  In this case, \nDefendant does not contend, nor does the Court find, that the complaint presents any similar \ninconsistency or contradiction. \n  6 Defendant\u2019s motion does not separately addr ess indirect infringement .  With respect to \nindirect infringement, Plaintiffs  allege that using the composi tions contained in the accused \nproducts in a specific way infringe s the patents-in-suit (\u201cfor the us e in treating or preventing age-\nrelated eye disease or for maintaining or pres erving eye health or vision, which infringe the \nclaims of the [patents-in-suit]\u201d),  and that Defendant knew of the patents-in-suit and intentionally \ncaused and induced its customers to infringe by selling the compositions  with promotions and \ninstructions for use.  (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, 28, 29)  Plaintiffs also a llege that Defendant \u201cis selling \noffering for sale and/or importing components or materials, knowi ng the same to be especially \nmade or especially adapted for use in an infringement\u201d of the patents-in-suit.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, 27, \n30)  These facts, accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorab le to Plaintiffs, are \nadequate to support plausible cla ims of indirect infringement.  See, e.g. , In re Bill of Lading \nTransmission & Processing Sys. Patent Litig. , 681 F.3d 1323, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding \nthat advertising of product\u2019s be nefits gives rise to reasonable inference of intention to induce \ncustomers to accomplish these benefits thr ough utilization of patented method).   \nDefendant\u2019s remaining arguments  focus on the merits, not th e adequacy, of Plaintiffs\u2019 \ninfringement claims, and do not pr ovide a basis for granting dismissa l.  Defendant contends that \nPlaintiffs cannot plausibly alle ge literal infringement because  the vitamin C content of the \naccused products is above the maximum vitamin C content claimed in the patents-in-suit.  ( See \n \nAdditionally, again in Bot M8 , the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s finding \nthat the plaintiff failed to  state an infringement claim because th e plaintiff failed to allege that \n\u201cthe game program and mutual au thentication program are stored together .\u201d  Id. at 1354-55.  The \nFederal Circuit observed that \u201c[w]hile [the plainti ff] points to different storage components in the \nallegedly infringing devices, it never says which one or ones sa tisfy the mutual authentication \nlimitation.\u201d  Id. at 1355.  Here, by contrast, the compla int identifies the ac cused products and \nexplicitly alleges that the compositions of th e accused products satisfy the claimed formulation \nof the asserted patents.  7D.I. 9 at 6, 16)  Defendant furthe r insists that Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the doctrine of equivalents is \nprecluded by prosecution history estoppel.  ( See id.  at 6-13)  Defendant\u2019s theory of no literal \ninfringement, however, requires the Court to cons ider materials outside of the pleadings and \nperform an early claim constructi on, practices either unpermitted or  unwarranted at the motion to \ndismiss stage.2  \nDefendant asks the Court to consider the labels of the accused products and accept the \nfacts described thereon \u2013 that th e vitamin C content of the accused  products is 750 mg \u2013 as true.  \n(See id.  at 16-17)  The labels of the accused products  are not part of the pleadings and Defendant \nhas not cited authority permitting the Court to co nsider their contents in connection with the \npending motion.  The accused product s\u2019 vitamin C content is not subject to judicial notice, \nbecause whether the labels accurately represen t the actual vitamin C c ontent of the accused \nproducts \u2013 although a proposition supported by a decl aration of one of Defendant\u2019s employee \n(see D.I. 11) \u2013 may be reasonably disputable.  Nor will the Court consider the product labels \nunder the incorporation-by-reference doc trine, as the labels are not \u201c integral to or explicitly \nrelied  upon in the complaint.\u201d  See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410, \n1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (emphasis added).  \nIn any event, even assuming the accused pr oducts\u2019 vitamin C content is 750 mg, whether \nthat amount falls outside of the claimed range requires claim c onstruction, as the plain text of the \nclaimed range \u2013 \u201capproximately 7 to 10 times the RDA\u201d \u2013 recites no absolute amounts.  \n \n2 Defendant repeatedly asserts th at Plaintiffs have \u201cconcede[d]\u201d there can be \u201cno literal patent \ninfringement.\u201d  ( See, e.g. , D.I. 14 at 4, 6)  The record reveal s no such concession.  Plaintiffs state \nthat \u201cto the extent the amount of vitamin C in the accused products does not fall within the literal \nscope of the vitamin C limitations of the Patents- in-Suit,\u201d it is insubstantially different from the \nclaimed range of vitamin C (D.I. 13 at 17 n.4), which suggests infringeme nt by equivalents but \nno abandonment of lite ral infringement.   8Defendant\u2019s contention that the patent specifica tion \u201cconfirms the equivalence of 7 to 10 times \nRDA with 420 to 600 mg\u201d because \u201cthe range cannot \u2018float\u2019 over time with changes in RDA\u201d is \nan argument that may be suita ble for claim construction ( see D.I. 9 at 7), but is not appropriately \nresolved at the pleading stage.  ( See D.I. 13 at 14; see also Nalco , 883 F.3d at 1349; Boston Fog, \nLLC v. Ryobi Techs., Inc. , 2020 WL 1532372, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2020); Innovative Global \nSys., LLC v. Keep Truckin, Inc. , 2020 WL 1443201, at *7 (D. Del. Mar. 24, 2020); Par Pharm., \nInc. v. Hospira, Inc. , 2018 WL 3343238, at *4 (D. Del. May 11, 2018))   \nB. Motion For A More Definite Statement Alternatively, Defendant contends that Plai ntiff should be ordered to provide a more \ndefinite statement \u201cto adequate ly apprise [D]efendant of the factual basis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 \ninfringement claims.  (D.I. 9 at  17)  But the complaint is no t \u201cso vague or ambiguous\u201d that it \nprevents Defendant from reason ably preparing a response.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).  As already \nexplained, the factual allegations of the complaint provide Defendant  with adequate notice as to \naccused infringement.  Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendant\u2019s alternative request for a \nmore definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.  The Court \nwill also deny Defendant\u2019s alternative request fo r a more definite statement.  An appropriate \norder follows. \n  "}
