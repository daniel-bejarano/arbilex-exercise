Civil Action No. 17-598-CFC\nKOKI HOLDINGS AMERICA LTD.\n\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this 21st day of December, 2022, the court having considered plaintiff\nKyocera Senco Industrial Tools, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) motion to lift the stay (D.I. 29), and the\nassociated briefing and filings (DI. 30; D.L. 32; D.I. 33; D.I. 34), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\nthat Plaintiffs motion is DENIED for the reasons set forth below.\n\n1. Background. On May 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit accusing defendant\nKoki Holdings America Ltd. (\u201cDefendant\u201d) of infringing six patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,011,547\n(\u201cthe \u00b0547 patent\u201d), 8,267,296 (\u201cthe \u2019296 patent\u201d), 8,267,297 (\u201cthe \u2019297 patent\u201d), 8,387,718 (\u201cthe\n\u00b0718 patent\u201d), 8,286,722 (\u201cthe \u2019722 patent\u201d), and 8,602,282 (\u201cthe \u2019282 patent\u201d) (collectively, the\n\u201cpatents-in-suit\u201d), (DL 1 at [ 21-78)\n\n2. On September 25, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the United States\nInternational Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) alleging that products imported by Defendant infringe\n\nthe patents-in-suit.! (D.I. 19 at 2) The ITC instituted Investigation No. 337-TA-1082 on\n\nNovember 15, 2017. (D.I. 21 at 1) The following day, the court instituted a mandatory stay of\n\n' Plaintiffs opening brief identifies different dates for the events described in this paragraph.\n(D.I. 30 at 1-2) The dates disclosed in Plaintiff's brief are inconsistent with the docket in this\ncase.\nthis action until a final determination in the ITC proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1659. (D.L.\n22)\n\n3. In the ITC proceeding, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant violated Section 337 of the\nTariff Act of 1930, codified at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, by importing products that infringed the\npatents-in-suit. (D.I. 30 at 1) Plaintiff subsequently moved to terminate the ITC investigation as\nto the \u2019547 patent, and it agreed not to go forward with its claims regarding the \u00b0296, \u2019297, \u00b0722,\nand \u2019282 patents. (D.1. 32 at 4) An evidentiary hearing was held on the \u2019718 patent, which was\nthe only remaining patent in the investigation. (/d.)\n\n4. On June 7, 2019, an ITC Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued an initial\ndetermination finding no violation of Section 337 due to no infringement of the \u2019718 patent.\n(D.I. 30 at 2; D.I. 32 at 4) Plaintiff petitioned the ITC for review, and the ITC remanded the\ndetermination to the ALJ for consideration of an unaddressed claim limitation. (Jd.) The ALJ\nissued another initial determination, again finding no infringement. (/d.)\n\n5. On March 5, 2020, the ITC reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and made a final\ndetermination of infringement and a violation of Section 337. (D.I. 30 at 2; D.I. 32 at 4-5) The\nITC also issued an order partially excluding the testimony of Plaintiff's expert and a cease-and-\ndesist order. (d.) Both parties appealed to the Federal Circuit. (/d.)\n\n6. The Federal Circuit vacated the ITC\u2019s final determination of infringement and\nremedial order partially excluding the testimony of Plaintiffs expert, remanding the case for\nfurther proceedings. See Kyocera Senco Indus. Tools Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, 22 F 4th 1369\n(Fed. Cir. 2022). The ITC subsequently sought comments from the parties on how the\ninvestigation should proceed. (D.I. 32 at 5) Defendant asked the ITC to find no violation of\n\nSection 337. (Jd. at 5) Plaintiff moved to terminate the remand proceedings and withdraw its\ncomplaint. (Id.; D.I. 30 at 3) Defendant opposed Plaintiff's requested relief, taking the position\nthat the ITC was obligated to issue a final determination of noninfringement under Section 337.\n(D.I. 30 at 3; DI. 32 at 5-6)\n\n7. In June of 2022, the ITC granted Plaintiffs motion to withdraw and terminated\nthe investigation without reaching a final determination under Section 337. (D.L. 30 at 3; D.I. 32\nat 5-6) The following month, Defendant appealed the ITC\u2019s termination decision to the Federal\nCircuit. (D.I. 32, Ex. A) Plaintiff moved to intervene, and the ITC responded by filing a motion\nto dismiss the appeal on procedural grounds. (Ud, Exs. B, E) In September, the Federal Circuit\ndenied the ITC\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal without prejudice and directed the parties to\naddress jurisdictional issues in their briefs on the merits of the appeal. (D.I. 34)\n\n8. Legal standard. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1659(a), a district court is required to stay all\ncivil proceedings involving parties that are also parties to a proceeding before the ITC under\nSection 337 \u201cuntil the determination of the Commission becomes final[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1659(a);\nsee Fuji Photo Film Co. y. Benun, 463 F.3d 1252, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The purpose of the\nmandatory stay provision is to avoid duplicative proceedings in the district court and the ITC\n\u201cwhen parallel claims involve the same issues about the same patent.\u201d Wirtgen Am., Inc. v.\nCaterpillar Inc., C.A. No. 17-770-RGA, 2021 WL 7209780, at *1 (D. Del. May 27, 2021) (citing\nHR. Rep. No. 103-826(1), at 140 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3773, 3912-13). ITC\nproceedings are considered final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1659(a) when they are \u201cno longer subject to\njudicial review,\u201d including any remand proceedings. In re Princo Corp., 478 F.3d 1345, 1355\n\n(Fed. Cir. 2007).\n\n9. Analysis. Plaintiffs motion to lift the stay is denied because the ITC\u2019s\ntermination of its investigation remains subject to judicial review by the Federal Circuit. See In\nre Princo, 478 F.3d at 1355 (concluding that \u00a7 1659 \u201crequires that the stay of district court\nproceedings continue until the Commission proceedings are no longer subject to judicial\nreview.\u201d). Plaintiff argues that the stay should be lifted because there are no remaining\nappealable issues for the Federal Circuit to address. (D.I. 30 at 5-8) But the issues of whether\nthe ITC was required to reach a final determination under Section 337, and whether its decision\nto grant Plaintiff's motion to withdraw was therefore improper, remain pending before the\nFederal Circuit. (D.I. 34) If the Federal Circuit rules in Defendant\u2019s favor on appeal, the case is\nlikely to be remanded with instructions for the ITC to affirmatively determine whether\nDefendant violated Section 337. In that event, the ITC would be required to address substantive\nissues left open after the previous Federal Circuit remand, such as \u201cwhat structures correspond to\nthe claimed \u2018lifter member\u2019\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112,96. Kyocera, 22 F.4th at 1381.\n\n10. Plaintiff argues that Defendant\u2019s appeal is improper because Defendant is not a\n\u201cperson adversely affected by a final determination of the Commission\u201d under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1337(c). (D.1. 30 at 6-8) But Plaintiff's jurisdictional challenges to the propriety of Defendant\u2019s\nappeal are pending before the Federal Circuit, which declined to dismiss these same arguments\non procedural grounds and ordered the issues to be briefed along with the substantive issues on\nappeal. (D.I. 32, Ex. B at 7-8; D.I. 34)\n\n11. Plaintiff further contends that the stay should be lifted because any decision by\nthe ITC following the appeal will not be binding on this court. (D.I. 30 at 8-9) In making this\nargument, Plaintiff does not acknowledge the mandatory stay provision under \u00a7 1659, which\n\nrequires the stay to remain in place \u201cuntil the determination of the Commission becomes final[.]\u201d\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1659(a). The purpose of \u00a7 1659 is to \u201cavoid[] litigation in two forums at once,\u201d and\nthat goal will still be served by maintaining the stay in this instance. Jn re Princo, 478 F.3d at\n1355. The Federal Circuit has recognized the utility of having a complete record from ITC\nproceedings before going forward with district court litigation, and for this reason, the statute\nprohibits the mandatory stay from being lifted until the ITC proceedings are final. Id.\n\n12. _ Plaintiff\u2019s position that perpetuating the stay would only serve to delay Plaintiff's\nability to litigate this case is not persuasive because the delays in litigating this case are the direct\nresult of Plaintiff's own actions, (D.I. 30 at 9-10) Plaintiff chose to file the ITC proceeding after\nthis litigation was filed and agreed to the mandatory stay under \u00a7 1659. (D.I. 22) Moreover, the\npending Federal Circuit appeal was made in response to Plaintiff's strategic decision to withdraw\nits claims before the ITC reached a final determination. (D.I. 32, Ex. A)\n\n13. Plaintiffs intention to file an amended complaint adding two more patents which\nwere not previously at issue in the ITC proceedings does not alter the analysis. (D.I. 30 at 10-11)\nClaims regarding the newly added patents would also be subject to the stay because the term\n\u201clifter\u201d appears in the claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 11,034,007 and 10,478,954. (D.I. 32, Exs. C,\nD) The Federal Circuit previously ordered further proceedings on this term, and the ITC is likely\nto revisit the issue if the Federal Circuit rules in Defendant\u2019s favor on the currently pending\nappeal. See Kyocera, 22 F 4th at 1381.\n\n14. Plaintiffs reliance on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. v. Mediatek, Inc. is not\npersuasive. C.A. No. 19-70-CFC, 2019 WL 4082836 (D. Del. Aug. 29, 2019). There, the court\nruled on whether to grant a motion to stay, as opposed to whether to continue an existing stay\nunder \u00a7 1659. The focus of the court\u2019s analysis was therefore on whether \u201cthe parties are\n\ncurrently parties to a proceeding pending before the Commission.\u201d /d. at *1. In contrast, the\n\nquestion before the court in this case is whether the ITC ruling is final and no longer subject to\njudicial review. See 9, supra. Because an appeal of the ITC ruling remains pending before the\nFederal Circuit, lifting the stay at this juncture would be premature. See In re Princo, 478 F.3d\nat 1355.\n\n15. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs motion to lift the stay is\nDENIED. (D.L. 29)\n\n16. | This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a), and D.
