INTRODUCTION\n\nPresently before the court in this patent infringement action are three Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotions to dismiss filed by the following defendants: (1) defendant UMC Ingredients, LLC\n(\u201cUMC Ingredients\u201d) (D.I. 37); (2) defendants Anhui Jinhe Industrial Co., Ltd. (\u201cJinhe China\u201d)\nand Jinhe USA LLC (\u201c\u2018Jinhe USA;\u201d together with Jinhe China, \u201cJinhe\u201d) (D.I. 39); and (3)\ndefendant Prinova US LLC (\u201cPrinova;\u201d collectively with UMC Ingredients and Jinhe,\n\u201cDefendants\u201d) (D.I. 42).! For the following reasons, I recommend that the court DENY the three\n\npending motions to dismiss.\n\n' The briefing associated with the pending motions is found at D.I. 38, D.I. 40, D.I. 43, D.I. 46,\nD.I. 47, D.L. 48, D.L. 49, D.L. 50, and D.L 51.\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs Celanese International Corporation, Celanese (Malta) Company 2 Limited, and\nCelanese Sales U.S. Ltd. (collectively, \u201cCelanese\u201d) initiated this patent infringement action on\nDecember 28, 2020, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 10,233,164 (\u201cthe \u2019164 patent\u201d),\n10,590,096 (\u201cthe \u00b0096 patent\u201d), 10,227,316 (\u201cthe \u00b0316 patent\u201d), and 10,590,097 (\u201cthe 097\npatent\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cAsserted Patents\u201d). (D.I. 1) Celanese filed its first amended\ncomplaint on April 29, 2021, alleging infringement of the same Asserted Patents. (D.I. 34) Each\nof the Asserted Patents recites method claims for producing acesulfame potassium compositions\nwith reduced or eliminated levels of impurities. (/d. at f] 25, 30, 37, 41)\n\nThe ?164 patent, which issued on March 19, 2019, is a continuation of U.S. Patent No.\n10,029,998 (\u201cthe \u2019998 patent\u201d), which issued on July 24, 2018. (D.L. 34 at ff 21-23) The \u2019096\npatent issued on March 17, 2020 and is a continuation of the \u2019164 patent. (/d. at] 23) These\npatents are directed to compositions and processes for producing high purity acesulfame\npotassium, which is used as a food sweetener. (Jd. at ]25) Conventional acesulfame potassium\nproduction processes resulted in the production of undesirable impurities like acetoacetamide-N-\nsulfonic acid, and removal of the impurities was difficult and costly. (Id. at [] 26-32) The \u2019164\nand \u2019096 patents claim processes for producing high purity acesulfame potassium compositions\nthat reduce or eliminate the formation of impurities, resulting in increased yields of the finished\ncomposition and substantial cost savings in the manufacturing process. (Jd. at F{ 30, 32)\n\nThe \u00b0316 patent, which issued on March 12, 2019, is a continuation of U.S. Patent No.\n10,030,000 (\u201cthe \u2019000 patent\u201d), which issued on July 24, 2018. (D.L. 34 at ff 33-34) The \u2019097\npatent issued on March 17, 2020 and is a continuation of the \u00b0316 patent. (/d. at 935) Like the\n\n\u00b0096 and the \u2019164 patents, the \u2019097 and \u00b0316 patents are directed to compositions and processes\nfor producing high purity acesulfame potassium. (/d. at \u00a737) The \u00b0097 and \u2019316 patents provide\nimproved processes for producing acesulfame potassium compositions that reduce or eliminate\nthe formation of impurities such as 5-chloro-acesulfame potassium. (Jd. at J] 38-41)\n\nJinhe manufactures a high-purity acesulfame potassium composition (the \u201cAccused\nProduct\u201d or \u201cAce-K\u201d) in China having the molecular formula CsH4NO4SK. (D.I. 34 at J] 44-45)\nJinhe\u2019s Ace-K product manual represents that it is acceptable for the Accused Product to have an\n\u201coverall organic impurity level of less than 20 wppm.\u201d* (Id. at 85, 101, 117, 134) The\namended complaint cites Jinhe\u2019s website and annual reports in support of Celanese\u2019s allegation\nthat Jinhe sells the Accused Product globally, with a substantial portion of its revenue\nattributable to sales made in the United States. (/d. at J] 46-47, 49, 56) According to the\namended complaint, Jinhe China sells the Accused Product directly to United States customers,\nand all Defendants import the Accused Product into the United States. (/d. at JJ 47, 54, 56, 62,\n66, 68, 79, 95, 111, 127)\n\nOn December 3, 2021, Celanese filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint\nto add allegations that Defendants directly, indirectly, and willfully infringe the claims of U.S.\nPatent No. 10,029,998, the parent of two of the currently Asserted Patents. (D.I. 79; D.I. 80 at 1)\nThe motion is not yet fully briefed and has no bearing on the following analysis, which addresses\nonly the sufficiency of the claims brought against the Asserted Patents.\n\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\n\n2 The term \u201cwppm\u201d is an acronym for \u201cweight parts per million.\u201d\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,\n790-91 (3d Cir. 2016).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\ny. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 USS. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n663-64.\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Direct Infringement Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g)\nSection 271(g) provides that \u201c[w]hoever without authority imports into the United States\n\nor offers to sell, sells, or uses within the United States a product which is made by a process\npatented in the United States shall be liable as an infringer.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g). Under the\nstatute, liability is not predicated on practicing the patented process abroad. Syngenta Crop\nProtection, LLC v. Willowood, LLC, 844 F.3d 1344, 1359-60 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Instead, liability\nfor infringement arises when products made abroad using the patented process are sold or\nimported within the United States. /d.; see also Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V. v. Mylan Pharms.\nInc., C.A. No. 15-760-SLR-SRF, 2016 WL 5723652, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2016)\n(\u201c[C]onsistent with the language of the statute, the act of infringement is the importation of a\nproduct made by a process patented in the United States, not the act of manufacturing the\nproduct.\u201d). Section 271(g) \u201cis meant to give relief to process patent holders when the resulting\nproducts of their patented process are used within the United States\u2014regardless of where the\nprocess is practiced.\u201d Zoltek Corp. v. U.S., 672 F.3d 1309, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n\n\u201cLiability under \u00a7 271(g) is subject to the same pleading standard as direct infringement\nunder \u00a7 271(a).\u201d Anza Tech., Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 2016 WL 8732647, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Nov.\n4, 2016). Accordingly, a plaintiff must plead facts that plausibly suggest that the accused\nproduct or process meets each limitation of the asserted claim or claims. See Kajeet, Inc. v.\nGryphon Online Safety, Inc., C.A. No. 19-2370-MN et al., 2021 WL 780737, at *3 (D. Del. Mar.\n1, 2021) (citing Disc Disease Sols. Inc. v. VGH Sols., Inc., 888 F.3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2018)).\n\u201c[Dlirect infringement of a method claim requires a showing that every step of the claimed\nmethod has been practiced.\u201d Meyer Intellectual Props. Ltd. v. Bodum, Inc., 690 F.3d 1354, 1366\n(Fed. Cir. 2012). Decisions from this district have found that pleadings merely parroting the\nwords of the asserted claims do not meet the plausibility threshold, explaining that the pleading\nmust allege facts articulating why it is plausible that the claims are infringed. See Modern\n\nTelecom Sys., LLC v. TCL Corp., C.A. No. 17-583-LPS-CJB; 2017 WL 6524526, at *3 (D. Del.\nDec. 21, 2017); North Star Innovations, Inc. v. Micron Tech., Inc., C.A. No. 17-506-LPS-CJB;\n2017 WL 5501489, at *1 (D. Del. Nov. 16, 2017).\n1. Infringement of the claimed method steps\n\nAs an initial matter, Defendants contend that the amended complaint fails to plead\ninfringement of the Asserted Patents because it does not give rise to a reasonable inference that\nall steps of the claimed methods are performed by the accused infringer. (D.I. 38 at 10-12; D.I.\n40 at 13-14; D.I. 43 at 7-9) Specifically, Defendants challenge Celanese\u2019s failure to include a\ndetailed factual comparison between Jinhe China\u2019s manufacturing process and the steps of the\npatented processes. (Jd.) Instead, Defendants argue that the amended complaint parrots the\nlanguage of the asserted claims in a conclusory manner, with a focus on the purity levels of the\nAccused Product. (/d.)\n\nBut Celanese explains that the details of Jinhe\u2019s manufacturing process are not publicly\navailable, and the amended complaint necessarily relies on the small amount of publicly\navailable information and the impurity limits of the Accused Product to plead that Jinhe\u2019s\nmanufacturing process infringes the Asserted Patents. (D.I. 47 at 8-9) Although information on\nJinhe\u2019s alleged use of the claimed process parameter limitations is not publicly available,\nCelanese suggests that satisfaction of those limitations can be inferred from the impurity levels\npresent in the Accused Product and the cost savings associated with the claimed process\nparameters. (Jd. at 10-11)\n\nThe amended complaint plausibly alleges that Jinhe China performs the claimed method\nsteps to manufacture the Accused Product. The pleading alleges that Jinhe China manufactures\nand supplies Ace-K having the molecular formula of acesulfame potassium, and it describes the\n\nphysical characteristics and uses of Ace-K. (D.I. 34 at \u00a79 45, 48-50) The amended complaint\nalso alleges that impurities such as acetoacetamide-N-sulfonic acid and 5-chloro-acesulfame\npotassium are present in both the Accused Product and the acesulfame potassium manufactured\nby the patented processes. (/d. at [{ 27, 30-31, 38, 41-42, 53, 84, 98, 100, 114, 116, 131, 133)\nThis supports an inference that Jinhe China\u2019s process for manufacturing the Accused Product\nfollows the same conventional steps outlined in the amended complaint and the Asserted Patents.\n(7164 patent, claim 1; \u2019316 patent, claim 1; D.L. 34 at ff 31, 42, 82, 98, 114, 118) The amended\ncomplaint also cites Jinhe\u2019s Ace-K product manual and other publicly available information to\ndemonstrate that the levels of acetoacetamide-N-sulfonic acid and 5-chloro-acesulfame\npotassium in Jinhe\u2019s product are comparable to the impurity levels resulting from the use of the\npatented processes. (D.I. 34 at [{ 51-53, 55, 82-86, 98-102, 114-18, 131-35) For instance, the\namended complaint alleges that the Accused Product contains 5-chloro-acesulfame potassium at\na level below the claimed maximum limit of 39 wppm based on representations in the Ace-K\nproduct manual that it may have an overall organic impurity level of less than 20 wppm. (Jd. at\n4M] 116-17, 133-34)\n\nCelanese concedes that the amended complaint does not explicitly demonstrate Jinhe\nChina\u2019s use of the process parameter limitations of the Asserted Patents, noting that Jinhe\u2019s\nmanufacturing parameters for these steps are not publicly available. (D.I. 47 at 10-11) Under\nsimilar circumstances, courts in this district have upheld the sufficiency of the pleadings when\nmore detailed factual information is not publicly available. See Kyowa Hakka Bio, Co., Lid. v.\nAjinomoto Co., Inc., C.A. No. 17-313-MSG, 2018 WL 834583, at *6, 8-9 (D. Del. Feb. 12, 2018)\n(denying motion to dismiss \u00a7 271(g) claim because plaintiffs could not specifically plead the\nexact processes used by defendants where defendants did not publicly disclose those processes).\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs cannot be charged with knowing, at the time they drafted their Complaint, non-public\ninformation they could only obtain after filing suit and obtaining discovery.\u201d BioM\u00e9rieux, S.A. v.\nHologic, Inc., C.A. No. 18-21-LPS, 2018 WL 4603267, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018). \u201cA\ndefendant cannot shield itself from a complaint . . . by operating in such secrecy that the filing of\na complaint itself is impossible.\u201d DermaFocus LIC v. Ulthera, Inc., 201 F. Supp. 3d 465, 467\n(D. Del. 2016).\n\nThe allegations in Celanese\u2019s amended complaint are sufficient to give rise to a plausible\ninference that the process used by Jinhe China to manufacture the Accused Product infringes the\nprocess parameter limitations of the Asserted Patents. Both the amended complaint and the \u00b0316\npatent explain that acesulfame potassium contains the impurity 5-chloro-acesulfame potassium\nwhen it is produced by conventional methods, and separating this impurity from the desired final\nproduct using standard purification procedures is difficult. (D.I. 34 at ff 38-39; \u00b0316 patent, col.\n1:43-53) The use of specific reaction parameters, such as a low temperature cyclizing agent,\nreduces or eliminates 5-chloro-acesulfame potassium formation in the crude, intermediate, and\nfinished acesulfame potassium compositions. (D.L 34 at JJ 41-42; \u2019316 patent, col. 5:11-53) By\nreducing the levels of impurities, the improved processes result in increased yields and\nsignificant cost savings, and Jinhe China would be motivated to capture those cost savings. (D.I.\n34 at J] 43, 118) It can reasonably be inferred that Jinhe China infringes the process parameter\nlimitations of the Asserted Patents because the impurity levels of the Accused Product fall within\nthe scope of the claim limitations, and the \u2019316 patent suggests this could not be achieved\nwithout implementation of the process parameter limitations: \u201c[W]ithout limiting temperature\n(and optionally contact time) as described herein, resultant crude, intermediate, and finished\nacesulfame potassium compositions will detrimentally have greater amounts of 5-chloro-\n\nacesulfame potassium.\u201d (\u2019316 patent, col. 5:54-58) These allegations are sufficient to provide\nDefendants with notice of the alleged infringement of the Asserted Patents. See Disc Disease\nSols. Inc. v. VGH Sols., Inc., 888 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (concluding that plausibility\nstandard was met where complaint identified asserted patents and accused products, and alleged\nthat the accused products met each limitation of at least one asserted claim).\n\n2. Infringement under \u00a7 271(g) by Jinhe China\n\nJinhe contends that the amended complaint fails to adequately plead direct infringement\nby Jinhe China under \u00a7 271(g) because there is no allegation that Jinhe China imports the\nAccused Product into the United States. (D.I. 40 at 7-8) In response, Celanese argues the\namended complaint adequately alleges that Jinhe China offers for sale and sells the Accused\nProduct to customers in the United States after manufacturing the Accused Product using the\npatented processes in China. (D.I. 47 at 6) Celanese also argues that Jinhe China is actively\ninvolved in importing the Accused Product into the United States either alone or with other\nDefendants. (Jd. at 7)\n\nI recommend that the court deny Jinhe\u2019s motion to dismiss Celanese\u2019s \u00a7 271(g) claim\nagainst Jinhe China because the amended complaint adequately alleges that Jinhe China sells the\nAccused Product directly to customers in the United States:\n\nOn information and belief, a substantial portion of [Jinhe\u2019s reported global\n\nrevenues for fiscal years 2017 through 2019] is attributable to infringing sales\n\nmade in the United States, including, without limitation: (a) Jinhe\u2019s Ace-K sold\n\ndirectly to consumers and companies in the United States. . . .\n\n(D.I. 34 at ]47) This allegation is supported by exhibits attached to the amended complaint\nshowing that Jinhe China shipped Ace-K to U.S.-based Defendants Jinhe USA, UMC\nIngredients, and Prinova. (D.I. 34 at {J 6-8, Exs. M-O) For purposes of a claim for direct\ninfringement under \u00a7 271, a sale takes place in the United States when an infringing article is\n\nsold to a U.S. buyer, regardless of whether the goods were shipped f.0.b. See Litecubes, LLC v.\nNorthern Light Prods., Inc., 523 F.3d 1353, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008). It is plausible to infer from\nthese shipping records that Jinhe China sold the Accused Product directly to U.S. consumers in\nsatisfaction of the requirements to plead direct infringement under \u00a7 271(g).\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the amended complaint also adequately pleads that Jinhe\nChina imports the Accused Product, stating that \u201cJinhe has and/or is importing, and has\nparticipated in the importation of, the Accused Product into the United States.\u201d (/d. at ]58) The\nquestion of whether Jinhe China\u2019s role in the importation process satisfies \u00a7 271(g) raises factual\nissues not appropriately resolved on a motion to dismiss. In Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC v.\nWillowood, LLC, the Federal Circuit addressed similar arguments in post-trial motions following\nthe jury verdict. 944 F.3d 1344, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Specifically, the Federal Circuit\nconsidered whether the foreign manufacturer\u2019s coordination of shipping from China to the\nUnited States, payment of freight charges, and arrangement of deliveries subjected the foreign\nmanufacturer to liability under \u00a7 271(g) as an importer. Jd. Stressing that \u201c[t]he question before\nus is not whether substantial evidence supports Syngenta\u2019s position but whether substantial\nevidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d the Federal Circuit upheld the jury\u2019s finding that the\nforeign manufacturer did not infringe the patents under \u00a7 271(g). Jd. Similar questions exist in\nthe present case about the extent of Jinhe China\u2019s role in the importation process, but the parties\ndid not have the benefit of fact discovery on the issue at the time the amended complaint was\nsubmitted. For these reasons, I recommend that the court deny Jinhe\u2019s motion to dismiss\nCelanese\u2019s \u00a7 271(g) claim against Jinhe China.\n\n3. Identification of direct infringers\nUMC Ingredients objects to the amended complaint\u2019s references to Defendants\n\ncollectively, without identifying which particular defendant is responsible for which allegedly\n\n10\ninfringing products, processes, or methods. (D.I. 38 at 14) However, the amended complaint\nspecifically alleges that Jinhe USA, UMC Ingredients, and Prinova directly infringed the\nAsserted Patents pursuant to \u00a7 271(g) by importing the Accused Product. (D.I. 34 at \u00a7{ 59-60,\n66-69, 79, 95, 111, 127) These pleaded facts are sufficient \u201cto render it plausible that each\ndefendant individually has performed at least one type of U.S.-related infringing act.\u201d Bench\nWalk Lighting LLC v. LG Innotek Co., Ltd., C.A. No. 20-51-RGA-CJB, 2021 WL 1226427, at\n*13 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2021). Accordingly, Celanese\u2019s grouping of Defendants in the amended\ncomplaint does not provide a basis for dismissal.\n4. Invalidity of the Asserted Patents\n\nUMC Ingredients argues that dismissal is warranted because Jinhe China\u2019s process for\nmanufacturing the Accused Product is not adequately identified in the pleading. (D.I. 38 at 13)\nIn support of its position, UMC Ingredients explains that it has purchased the Accused Product\nfrom Jinhe China since 2010, years prior to the issuance of the Asserted Patents. (/d.) Because\nthe amended complaint does not allege that Jinhe China changed its process for manufacturing\nthe Accused Product at any point since 2010, UMC Ingredients contends that the pleading\nsupports one of two conclusions: (1) Jinhe China\u2019s process for manufacturing the Accused\nProduct does not infringe the Asserted Patents; or (2) the Asserted Patents are invalid for\nclaiming processes known in the art, as evidenced by Jinhe China\u2019s long history of\nmanufacturing the Accused Product. (Jd. at 13, 15)\n\nCelanese responds that UMC Ingredients\u2019 arguments regarding the invalidity of the\nAsserted Patents cannot support a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6), which is limited to\nassessing the sufficiency of the complaint. (D.I. 46 at 12) Celanese further contends that UMC\n\nIngredients\u2019 invalidity arguments must fail because UMC Ingredients does not identify any\n\n11\npublicly available prior art disclosing or teaching the processes claimed by the Asserted Patents.\n(Id. at 12-13)\n\nAs discussed at \u00a7 IV.A.1, supra, the amended complaint plausibly alleges that Jinhe\nChina\u2019s method of manufacturing the Accused Product infringes the claim limitations of the\nAsserted Patents based on the information available to Celanese at this stage of the proceedings.\nIssues regarding whether Jinhe China used the allegedly infringing processes before the priority\ndate of the Asserted Patents are factual in nature and cannot be appropriately resolved on a\nmotion to dismiss. A patent is presumed valid, and a plaintiff need not prove the validity of the\npatent to bring a claim for infringement. See Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 575 U.S.\n632, 643-44 (2015). Instead, the defendant must prove invalidity by clear and convincing\nevidence to rebut the presumption of validity. Jd. at 644 (citing Microsoft v. i4i Ltd. P\u2019ship, 564\nU.S. 91, 102 (2011)). Consequently, UMC Ingredients\u2019 arguments regarding the validity of the\nAsserted Patents do not alter the foregoing analysis under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nFor these reasons, I recommend that the court deny Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss\nCelanese\u2019s causes of action for direct infringement under \u00a7 271(g).\n\nB. Induced Infringement Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b)\n\nUnder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b), \u201cwhoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be\nliable as an infringer.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b). In addition to showing direct infringement, a\nplaintiff asserting a cause of action for induced infringement must also show that \u201cthe alleged\ninducer knew of the patent, knowingly induced the infringing acts, and possessed a specific\nintent to encourage another\u2019s infringement of the patent.\u201d Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic Holding, Inc.,\n\n581 F.3d 1317, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S.\n\n3 The parties do not dispute the adequacy of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of direct infringement.\n\n12\n754, 766 (2011); In re Bill of Lading Transmission & Processing Sys. Patent Litig., 681 F.3d\n1323, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Knowledge of the patent, without knowledge of infringement, is\nnot enough to establish liability for induced infringement. See Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Sys.,\nInc., 575 U.S. 632, 135 S. Ct. 1920, 1926 (2015). Accordingly, the Federal Circuit has held that,\n\u201c{flor an allegation of induced infringement to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must\nplead facts plausibly showing that the accused infringer \u2018specifically intended [another party] to\ninfringe [the patent] and knew that the [other party]\u2019s acts constituted infringement.\u2019\u201d Lifetime\nIndus., Inc. v. Trim-Lok, Inc., 869 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Bill of Lading, 681\nF.3d at 1339).\n\nThe only Defendant accused of induced infringement in this matter is Jinhe China. (D.I.\n34 at JJ 80, 96, 112, 128) Celanese confirms in the briefing that it is not asserting a cause of\naction under \u00a7 271(b) against the other Defendants. (D.I. 46 at 13-14)\n\n1. Pre-suit knowledge\n\nJinhe contends that Celanese\u2019s allegations of induced infringement are inadequate under\nRule 12(b)(6) because the filing of the amended complaint cannot by itself establish Jinhe\nChina\u2019s pre-suit knowledge. (D.I. 40 at 9-10) Celanese does not allege that Jinhe China had the\nrequisite knowledge prior to the filing of the complaint. Instead, Celanese responds that the\npleading does not need to allege pre-filing knowledge because the indirect infringement\nallegations are only directed to post-suit conduct, and the complaint provides adequate notice of\ninfringement. (D.I. 47 at 15)\n\nThe amended complaint alleges that Defendants knew of their infringement of the\nAsserted Patents \u201cat least as early as the filing of the Complaint.\u201d (D.I. 34 at J 77, 93, 109,\n\n125) The majority of decisions in this district have held that knowledge obtained from the filing\n\n13\nof the complaint is sufficient to state a claim for inducement that is limited to post-filing conduct.\nSee Clouding IP, LLC v. Google Inc., C.A. No. 12-639-LPS, 2013 WL 5176702, at *1 (D. Del.\nSept. 16, 2013); see also DoDots Licensing Sols. LLC v. Lenovo Holding Co., Inc., C.A. No. 18-\n98-MN, 2019 WL 369773, at *3 (D. Del. July 12, 2019) (finding second amended complaint\u2019s\nallegations of knowledge based on the first amended complaint sufficient); KOM Software Inc. v.\nNetApp, Inc., C.A. No. 18-160-RGA, 2018 WL 6167978, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 26, 2018)\n(\u201cPlaintiff sufficiently alleges Defendant[\u2019s] knowledge via service of the original Complaint.\u201d);\nWalker Digital, LLC v. Facebook, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 2d 559, 565 (D. Del. 2012) (finding that\ncomplaint provided sufficient notice of indirect infringement claim limited to post-filing\nconduct). Celanese confirms that the cause of action under \u00a7 271(b) is limited to post-filing\nconduct. (D.I. 47 at 15) Consequently, Celanese\u2019s allegations of knowledge based on the filing\nof the original complaint are sufficient for purposes of stating a claim under \u00a7 271(b).\n2. Post-suit knowledge\n\nJinhe alleges that Celanese failed to adequately plead post-suit knowledge of\ninfringement because the amended complaint does not provide sufficient notice regarding how\nthe use of the Accused Product infringes the Asserted Patents. (D.I. 40 at 11) According to\nJinhe, the pleading does not identify a direct infringer, nor does it describe facts showing how\nJinhe China induced others to import the Accused Product made by the patented processes. (/d.\nat 12) In response, Celanese alleges that the original complaint contained sufficient information\nto put Jinhe on notice of the allegedly infringing activities. (D.I. 47 at 17)\n\nFor the reasons previously stated in \u00a7 IV.A.1, supra, the amended complaint adequately\nalleges that Jinhe China\u2019s method of manufacturing the Accused Product infringes the Asserted\n\nPatents. As such, Jinhe\u2019s reliance on Versata Software, Inc. v. Cloud9 Analytics, Inc. is not\n\n14\npersuasive. C.A. No. 12-925-LPS-CJB, 2014 WL 631517, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 18, 2014)\n(concluding that pleaded allegations did not plausibly assert knowledge of end users\u2019\ninfringement where complaint simply identified accused products and generically alleged their\nuse infringed the asserted patents); see also Princeton Digital Image Corp. v. Ubisoft Entm\u2019t SA,\nC.A. No. 13-335-LPS-CJB, 2017 WL 6337188, at *2 (D. Del. Dec. 12, 2017) (same); Valinge\nInnovation AB v. Halstead New England Corp., C.A. No. 16-1082-LPS-CJB, 2017 WL 5196379,\nat *3 (D. Del. Nov. 9, 2017) (same). Moreover, as set forth in \u00a7 IV.A.3, supra, the amended\ncomplaint expressly identifies Jinhe USA, UMC Ingredients, and Prinova as direct infringers\nunder \u00a7 271(g) based on their importation of the Accused Product into the United States. (D.I.\n34 at Ff 59-60, 66-69, 79, 95, 111, 127) The amended complaint further alleges that Jinhe China\nknew its manufacture of the Accused Product allegedly infringed the methods claimed in the\nAsserted Patents as of the date the original complaint was filed, but it nonetheless continued to\ninduce others to sell, offer for sale, use, and/or import the Accused Product in the United States.\n(DL. 34 at JJ 80, 96, 112, 128) These allegations plausibly show that Jinhe China knowingly\ninduced the infringing acts. See 3Shape A/S v. Align Tech., Inc., C.A. No. 18-886-LPS-CJB,\n2019 WL 1416466, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2019) (\u201c[T]he Federal Circuit has held that\nknowledge of infringement and specific intent may be inferred based on surrounding\ncircumstances . . . even where alternative inferences could be drawn.\u201d).\n3. Specific intent\n\nJinhe argues that the amended complaint does not plausibly satisfy the specific intent\n\nelement of a cause of action for induced infringement because it contains only generic assertions\n\nregarding infringement and the sale of the Accused Product on its global website. (D.I. 40 at 12-\n\n15\n13) However, Celanese contends that Jinhe\u2019s continued conduct after the filing of the original\ncomplaint confirms that Jinhe China possessed the requisite intent. (D.I. 47 at 18)\n\nThe amended complaint plausibly pleads that Jinhe China had the requisite intent to\ninduce infringement. For induced infringement claims, \u201cspecific intent may be inferred based on\nsurrounding circumstances, \u2018taken collectively and in context,\u2019 even where alternative inferences\ncould be drawn.\u201d 3Shape A/S , 2019 WL 1416466, at *2 (quoting Jn re Bill of Lading\nTransmission & Processing Sys. Patent Litig., 681 F.3d 1323, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2012)). In this\ncase, the amended complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to support an inference of\nspecific intent. For the reasons previously stated, the amended complaint plausibly alleges that\nJinhe China manufactures the Accused Product using the processes covered by the Asserted\nPatents and has been aware of the alleged infringement since the filing of the original complaint.\nThe amended complaint also alleges that Jinhe China \u201chas acted with the specific intent to\ninduce third parties, including suppliers and/or retailers/distributors, to sell, offer for sale, use,\nand/or import into the United States . . . the Accused Product.\u201d (D.1. 34 at FJ 80, 96, 112, 128)\nThese allegations are sufficient to support an inference that Jinhe China had the specific intent to\ninduce infringement of the Asserted Patents under the circumstances. See Groove Digital, Inc. v.\nJam City, Inc., C.A. No. 18-1331-RGA, 2019 WL 351254, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 29, 2019)\n(concluding that the pleading supported an inference of specific intent by alleging that the\ndefendant encouraged continued direct infringement after the filing of the complaint).\n\nFor these reasons, I recommend that the court deny Jinhe\u2019s motion to dismiss Celanese\u2019s\n\nclaims for induced infringement under \u00a7 271(b).\n\n16\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court DENY Jinhe\u2019s motion to dismiss\n(D.I. 39), UMC Ingredients\u2019 motion to dismiss (D.I. 37), and Prinova\u2019s motion to dismiss (D.I.\n42).\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.
