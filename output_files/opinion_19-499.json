R. Civ. P. 25(d).\nRO AARC Tune:\n\nPending before the Court is Petitioner Kevin Rasin\u2019s (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) Petition for a\nWrit of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d). (D.I. 1) The State\nfiled an Answer in opposition. (D.I. 13) For the reasons discussed, the Court will deny\nthe Petition as barred by the limitations period prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn March 19, 2012, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of gang\nparticipation, first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, second degree\nconspiracy, two counts of possession of a firearm by a person prohibited (\u201cPFBPP\u201d),\nand possession of firearm during the commission of a felony (\u201cPFDCF\u201d). (D.I. 13 at 2);\nsee Rasin v. State, 187 A.3d 1209 (Table), 2018 WL 2355941, at *1 (Del. May 23,\n2018.) The Superior Court sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder and\nattempted murder convictions, and a total of twelve years\u2019 imprisonment for the other\nconvictions. (D.l. 13 at 2) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's\nconvictions and sentence on September 25, 2013. See Taylor v. State, 76 A.3d 791,\n803 (Del. 2013).\n\nOn October 18, 2014, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a motion for\npostconviction relief pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motion\u2019).\nThe Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner, who then filed an\namended Rule 61 motion on October 31, 2016. (D.I. 13 at 2) The Superior Court\ndenied the amended Rule 61 motion on November 14, 2017, and the Delaware\n\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision on May 23, 2018. See Rasin, 2018 WL 2355941,\nat *1. Petitioner filed a second pro se Rule 61 motion on August 23, 2018. (D.I. 14-27)\nThe Superior Court denied that motion on September 21, 2018, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court affirmed that decision March 27, 2019. See State v. Rasin, 2018 WL\n4583485 (Del. Super. Ct. Sept. 21, 2018); Rasin v. State, 207 A.3d 1125 (Table), 2019\nWL 1410748, at *2 (Del. Mar. 27, 2019).\nIn March 2019, Petitioner filed the instant Petition asserting six ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel claims. (D.I. 1 at 5-9, 27-29)\nIl. ONE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\nCongress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(\u201cAEDPA\u2019) \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences . .\n. and to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u201d Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003). AEDPA prescribes a one-year period of limitations for the\nfiling of habeas petitions by state prisoners, which begins to run from the latest of:\n\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the\n\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\n\nseeking such review;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application\n\ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws\n\nof the United States is removed, if the applicant was\n\nprevented from filing by such State action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was\n\ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been\n\nnewly recognized by the Supreme Court and made\n\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or\n\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\n\nclaims presented could have been discovered through the\nexercise of due diligence.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). AEDPA\u2019s limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable\ntolling. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631 (2010) (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may be also excused from failing to comply\nwith the limitations period by making a gateway showing of actual innocence. See\nWallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F. 4\u00b0 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (actual innocence exception).\n\nPetitioner does not assert, and the Court does not discern, any facts triggering\nthe application of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B),(C), or (D). Consequently, the one-year period of\nlimitations began to run when Petitioner's convictions became final under \u00a7\n2244(d)(1)(A).\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment\nbut does not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the\nStatute of limitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed\nfor seeking certiorari review. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012). In this\ncase, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's conviction on September 25,\n2013, and he did not seek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his\njudgment of conviction became final on December 24, 2013. Applying the one-year\nlimitations period to that date, Petitioner had until December 26, 2014 to timely file a\nhabeas petition.2 See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 (3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA\u2019s limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, 2015 WL\n1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period is\n\nThe last day of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period fell on a federal holiday.\nTherefore, the time to file a timely 2254 petition extended through the end of the day on\nDecember 26, 2014. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1)(C).\n\n4\ncalculated according to the anniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on\nthe anniversary of the date it began to run). Petitioner electronically filed the instant\nPetition on March 13, 2019, more than four years after that deadline. Thus, the Petition\nis time-barred and should be dismissed, unless the limitations period can be statutorily\nor equitably tolled, or Petitioner makes a gateway showing of actual innocence. See\nJones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir. 1999); see Wallace v. Mahanoy, 2 F.4*\n133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021) (explaining that actual innocence is an \u201cexception to the statute\nof limitations\u201d rather than an \u201cextension to the statute of limitations via equitable\ntolling.\u201d). The Court will discuss each doctrine in turn.\n\nA. Statutory Tolling\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts,\nincluding any post-conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending\nbefore the expiration of AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d\n417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A post-conviction motion is \u201cproperly filed\u2019 for statutory\ntolling purposes when its delivery and acceptance is in compliance with the state\u2019s\napplicable laws and rules governing filings, such as the form of the document, any time\nlimits upon its delivery, the location of the filing, and the requisite filing fee.\u201d Crump v.\nPhelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations period is also tolled for\nthe time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be filed even if\nthe appeal is not eventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. The limitations period,\n\nhowever, is not tolled during the ninety days a petitioner has to file a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court regarding a judgment denying a state\npost-conviction motion. See Stokes v. Dist. Att'y of Philadelphia, 247 F.3d 539, 542 (3d\nCir. 2001).\n\nWhen Petitioner filed his first Rule 61 motion on October 18, 2014, 298 days of\nAEDPA\u2019s limitations period had already expired. His first Rule 61 motion tolled the\nlimitations period from October 18, 2014 through May 23, 2018, the date on which the\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s denial of his Rule 61 motion.\nThe limitations clock started to run again on May 24, 2018, and ran the remaining 67\ndays of the limitations period without interruption until it ended on July 30, 2018.\nPetitioner's second Rule 61 motion, filed on August 23, 2018, has no statutory tolling\neffect because it was filed after the expiration of the limitations period.\n\nB. Equitable Tolling\n\nThe one-year limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons in rare\ncircumstances when the petitioner demonstrates \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and\nprevented timely filing.\u201d Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With respect to the diligence\ninquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to the petitioner's\nexcusable neglect. /d. at 651-52. Additionally, the obligation to act diligently \u201cdoes not\npertain solely to the filing of the federal habeas petition, rather it is an obligation that\nexists during the period [the petitioner] is exhausting state court remedies as well.\u201d\nLaCava v. Kyler, 398 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir. 2005). As for the extraordinary\n\ncircumstance requirement, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged\nto be extraordinary is unique to the petitioner, but how severe an obstacle it creates with\nrespect to meeting AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline.\u201d Pabon v. Mahanoy, 654 F.3d 385,\n401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if\nthere is \u201ca causal connection, or nexus, between the extraordinary circumstance [] and\nthe petitioner\u2019s failure to file a timely federal petition.\u201d Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784,\n803 (3d. Cir. 2013).\n\nPetitioner does not assert that any extraordinary circumstance prevented him\nfrom complying with AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. To the extent Petitioner's\nlate filing in this Court was due to a lack of legal knowledge or miscalculation of\nAEDPA\u2019s one-year filing period, such circumstances do not warrant equitably tolling the\nlimitations period. See Taylor v. Carroll, 2004 WL 1151552, at *5-6 (D. Del. May 14,\n2004).\n\nC. Actual Innocence\n\nFinally, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \u201cequitable\nexception\u201d that can overcome the bar of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. See\nMcQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S 383, 392 (2013); Wallace, 2 F. 4 at 150-151.\nPetitioner, however, does not assert any claim of actual innocence.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the instant Petitioner as time-barred.\u00b0\nIll. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nThe Court must decide whether to issue a certificate of appealabilty. See 3d Cir.\nL.A.R. 22.2 (2011). A certificate of appealability may be issued only when a petitioner\n3Having determined that the Petition is time-barred, the Court will not address the\n\nState\u2019s alternate reasons for dismissing the Petition.\n7\nmakes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2253(c)(2). This showing is satisfied when the petitioner demonstrates \u201cthat reasonable\njurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or\nwrong.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Petitioner's habeas\nPetition must be dismissed as time-barred. Reasonable jurists would not find the\nCourt's assessment of Petitioner's constitutional claims to be debatable or wrong.\nConsequently, Petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right, and a certificate of appealability will not be issued.\n\nIv. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss the instant Petition as time-\n\nbarred. An appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nKEVIN RASIN,\n\nPetitioner,\n\nv. ; Civil Action No. 19-499-CFC\n\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nORDER\nAt Wilmington, this Seventh day of February in 2022, for the reasons set\nforth in the Memorandum Opinion issued this date;\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n1. Petitioner Kevin Rasin\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (D.I. 1) is DISMISSED, and the relief requested therein is DENIED.\n2. The Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability because\nPetitioner has failed to satisfy the standards set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The\n\nClerk shall close the case.\n\nColm F. Connaty 7\n\nChief Judge\n"}
