WILLIAMS \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE In this action filed by Plaintiffs Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., Zambon S.p.A., and MDD \nUS Operations, LLC (together, \"Plaintiffs\") against Defendants MSN Laboratories Private \nLimited, RK Pharma Inc., Prinston Pharmaceutical , Inc., and Prinston Pharmaceutical , Inc., and \nZenara Pharma Private Limited (together, \"Defendants \"), Plaintiffs allege infringement of U.S. \nPatent No. 8,076,515 (\"the '515 patent\"), U.S. Patent No. 8,278,485 (\"the '485 patent\"), and U.S. \nPatent No. 8,283,380 (\"the '380 patent\"). Before the Court is the issue of claim construction of \nmultiple terms in these patents. The Court has considered the parties' joint claim construction brief, \nthe accompanying appendix and declarations , the parties' supplemental submissions as requested \nby the Court, and argument at the claim construction hearing (the \"Hearing\"). See D.I. 120, 133, \n134, 180, 181, 198, 199. \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nA. Claim Construction \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. \nSumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides \nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention \"). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction .\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the \nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent \nlaw.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although \nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. \n831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372 (1996)). \n2 \"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as \nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and \nprosecution history.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to \nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term \nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at \nat 1313. \n\"When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic \nevidence, including the claims themselves, the specification , and the prosecution history of the \npatent, which is usually dispositive. \" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted , \ncan ... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In \naddition, \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]\" Id. For example, \"the \npresence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the \nlimitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-15. \nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which \"is always highly \nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptroni c, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is \nalso possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the \npatentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's \nlexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only \n3 a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the \npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of \nmanifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) ( quoting Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., \n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be \nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language .\" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d \n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \nThe Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence. \" \nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.] \" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic \nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nB. Indefinit eness \nSection 112 of Title 35 imposes a definiteness requirement on patent claims. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n112(b) (requiring that the claims \"particularly point[] out and distinctly claim[] the subject matter \nwhich the inventor .. . regards as the invention \"). \"The primary purpose of the definiteness \n4 requirement is to ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public \nof the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, \ne.g., competitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe.\" All Dental \nProdx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \n\"A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification \ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those \nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc., 572 \nU.S. 898,901 (2014). To determine indefiniteness , courts examine \"the patent record-the claims, \nspecification, and prosecution history-to ascertain if they convey to one of skill in the art with \nreasonable certainty the scope of the invention claimed.\" Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Like claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, \nbut the Court must sometimes render factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the \nultimate issue of definiteness. See, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int'!, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, \n1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 842-43. \"Any fact critical to a holding on \nindefiniteness ... must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing evidence. \" Intel Corp. \nv. VIA Techs., Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Tech. Licensing Corp. v. \nVideotek, Inc., 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nII. AGREED-UPON TERMS \nThe parties agreed upon the construction of four claim terms as follows: \nClaim Term Agreed-Upon Construction \n\"an effective amount\" \"an amount sufficient to treat the selected \n(' 515 patent, claim 40) CNS disorder\" \n5 Plain and ordinary meaning, \"with an \n\"classified as\" understanding that Defendants may argue that \n(' 515 patent, claim 44) the terms are indefinite in the \nfactual context of an infringement analysis\" \n(D.I. 181) \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"with an \n\"are known to interact with\" understanding that Defendants may argue that \n(' 515 patent, claim 44) the terms are indefinite in the \nfactual context of an infringement analysis\" \n(D.I. 181) \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"with an \n\"are known to have HERG channel blocking understanding that Defendants may argue that \nproperties \" the terms are indefinite in the \n(' 515 patent, claim 44) factual context of an infringement analysis\" \n(D.I. 181) \nD.I. 180 at 3. The Court will adopt these agreed-upon constructions and will grant Defendants \nleave to renew their indefiniteness argument s. \nIII. DISPUTED TERMS \nA. \"stable dose of levodopa\" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"stable dose of \"a dose of levodopa Not amenable to \"a dose of levodopa \nlevodopa \" that is neither increased construction; that is neither \n('380 patent , claims nor decreased\" indefinite increased nor \n1-2) decreased\" \n' \nWhile Plaintiffs maintain that \"stable dose of levodopa\" can be understood according to its \nplain and ordinary meaning, which according to Plaintiffs is \"a dose of levodopa that is neither \nincreased nor decreased\", Defendants contend that \"stable dose\" is indefinite as it \"provides no \nindication of the length of time and frequency during that time\" so as to inform a skilled artisan \n6 with reasonable certainty what \"unchanging dose oflevodopa should be administered before it can \nbe considered to be 'stable.\"' D.I. 133 at 7-9. \nStarting with the claims, claim 1 of the '380 patent recites: \n1. In a method of treating idiopathic Parkinson's disease in a patient receiving \na stable dose of levodopa, the improvement comprising: \nconcurrently administering safinamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable \nsalt thereof, on an oral dosage schedule of about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about \n5 mg/kg/day, \nwhile maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa. \n'380 patent at cl. 1. Claim 2 of the '380 patent recites: \n2. A method of treating idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease comprising: \nadministering a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa; and \nconcurrently administering safinamide , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt \nthereof, on an oral dosage schedule of about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 5 \nmg/kg/day. \n'380 patent at cl. 2. In claim 1, which the parties agree is written in Jepson1 format (D.I. 133 at 5, \n10), the prior art methods of treating idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (\"PD\") used a \"stable dose of \nlevodopa\". The inventors improved upon the prior art by adding safinamide to the patient's \ntreatment regimen \"while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa.\" That the method \nof treatment involves \"maintaining\" a patient on that \"stable dose\" suggests that the \"stable dose\" \ndoes not increase or decrease. Further, given claim l's Jepson format, explaining that treating a \npatient with a \"stable dose of levodopa\" was accomplished in the prior art, the claim language \nsuggests that a skilled artisan would understand how to treat PD with levodopa, including how to \nrecognize when a patient is receiving a stable levodopa dose. \n1 See Dow Chem. Co. v. Sumitomo Chem. Co., 257 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001) \n( explaining that when a claim \"is written in Jepson format, ... the claim first describes the scope \nof the prior art and then claims an improvement over the prior art.\"). \n7 Claim 2 recites, in non-Jepson format, a method of treatment that involves concurrent \nadministration of safinamide and a \"stable dose of levodopa. \" That the method of treatment \ninvolves \"administering a therapeuticall y effective stable dose\" implies that that once the \"stable \ndose\" is \"therapeuticall y effective,\" that dose stays the same. \nTurning to the specification , while the term \"stable dose of levodopa\" is not used, the \nspecification describes a clinical trial that studied the effect of safinamide on PD symptoms in a \n\"de novo\" group and \"single DA group\", the latter of which \"were treated with one single \ndopamine agonist at stable doses for at least four weeks prior to the screening visit.\" '380 patent \nat 20:25-36; 50-60. The specification describes that the single DA group fared better than the de \nnovo group \"when safinamide was added to a stabilized dose of a variety of dopamine agonists\" \n(as adjunctive therapy) as compared to when safinamide was administered alone (as monotherap y). \nId at 3:5-9; see also id at 23:51-55 (describin g favorable results for \"patients under stable \ndopamine agonist treatment \"). Thus, these descriptions suggest that \"stable doses\" and \"stabilized \ndose[s]\" are unchanged doses. \nThe prosecution history further supports understanding \"stable dose of levodopa \" as a dose \nthat is unchanged. In the Notice of Allowance , the Examiner's explained : \"By 'stable dose,' \nApplicant provides support for this term whereby the dose of L-DOPA is neither increased nor \ndecreased to treat a patient with Parkinson 's Disease ... thereby rendering it distinguishable from \nthe art.\" D.I. 120-24, Ex. Wat JA717. The prosecution history is also consistent with the four\u00ad\nweek time period identified in the specification as the applicant submitted materials describing a \nclinical study in which patients went through a four-week \"levodopa stabilization phase\". See, \ne.g., D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA427; D.I. 134-13, Ex. JJ at JA760; D.I. 120-22, Ex. U at JA507 (\"In \naddition, to guard against changes in drugs confounding the results of the clinical trial, patients \n8 must be on stable doses of these medication s for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the study, and \nthe drug and the dosage must be maintained at a constant level throughout the course of the study, \nif possible.\"). \nAccordingly , in light of the intrinsic record which suggests that a \"stable dose\" is one that \nis unchanged , the Court will construe \"stable dose of levodopa\" to mean \"a dose of levodopa that \nis neither increased nor decreased. \" \nDefendants do not provide an alternate construction. Instead, they contend that the term \n\"stable dose of levodopa\" is indefinite , arguing that \"(t]he intrinsic evidence fails to provide \nreasonable certainty as to the required period of time (i.e., days, weeks, months, etc.) and a \nfrequency of administration during that period of time (q.d., b.i.d., t.i.d., etc.) for a 'dose of \nlevodopa' to become 'stable.\"' D.I. 133 at 10. According to Defendants , without any \nmeasurement scale to determine what constitutes a \"stable dose\", \"stable dose of levodopa\" fails \nto provide objective boundaries to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 38. \nDescriptive words and terms of degree do not render a claim indefinite if there is adequate \nobjective guidance regarding the boundaries of the claim. See Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude \nMed, 30 F.4th 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2022); see also Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech v. ITC, 936 F.3d \n1353, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"(A] patentee need not define his invention with mathematical \nprecision in order to comply with the definiteness requirement.\") (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In some circumstances , a person of ordinary skill can ascertain an invention 's boundaries \nfrom exemplary designs or specific examples offering an \"objective anchor\" for \ncomparison. Niazi, 30 F.4th at 1348 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, the intrinsic record provides adequate reference points such that the Court cannot \nconclude \"stable dose oflevodopa \" is indefinite . The specification and prosecution history disclose \n9 a data point of four weeks as constituting being on a \"stable dose.\" '380 patent at 20:25-36 ; 20:50-\n60; 23:51-55 ; see also D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA427; D.I. 134-13, Ex. JJ at JA760; D.I. 120-22, Ex. \nU at JA507. While Defendants argue that the specification provides conflicting temporal guidance \nbecause it discloses that in the prior art, patients were administered levodopa for 5-7 years, '380 \npatent at 1 :28-33, the specification does not state that the levodopa dosage remained stable for that \n5-7 year time-period. Rather, the specification explains that patients treated with levodopa began \nto exhibit motor fluctuations after that time period. '380 patent at 1 :28-33. Accordingly, the \nspecification 's four-week period provides an objective anchor from which a skilled artisan can \ndetermine the scope of the claim. \nDefendants further contend that the specification 's disclosures are inapposite because they \nrelate to a stable dose of a dopamine agonist, which \"would be unhelpful to [ a person of ordinary \nskill in the art] deciphering the meaning of a 'stable dose of levodopa.\" ' D.I. 133 at 10-22. But \nDefendants do not support their assertion with any evidence as to what a person of ordinary skill \nin the art would understand about the claims' scope-even after the Court invited Defendants to \ndo so.2 Thus, \"Defendants ' attorney argument falls far short of meeting their burden to prove, by \nclear and convincing evidence ,\" that the '380 patent fails to reasonably inform a person of ordinary \nskill in the art about the scope of the invention. Dasso Int'!, Inc. v. MOSO N Am., Inc., No. 17-\n01574-RGA, 2019 WL 2135855 , at *2 (D. Del. May 16, 2019); see also MiiCs & Partners Am., \nInc. v. Toshiba Corp., No. 14-803-RGA , 2016 WL 4573103 , at *10 & n.23 (D. Del. Aug. 31, \n2016). The Court declines to find \"stable dose of levodopa\" to be indefinite. \n2 See October 7, 2022 Oral Order. B. \"maintaining \" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs ' Defendants ' I\\ The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"maintaining\" Plain and ordinary Not amenable to construction; Plain and ordinary \n(' 3 80 patent, meaning, which is indefinite meaning, which is \nclaim 1) \"keeping\" \"keeping\" \nWhile Plaintiffs argue that \"maintaining \" can be understood according to its plain and \nordinary meaning, which is \"keeping\" , Defendants contend the term is indefinite . D.I. 133 at 23-\n29. \nThe intrinsic record supports construing \"maintaining \" as \"keeping\". Starting with the \nclaims, claim 1 (as discussed supra) describes the prior art method of treating a PD patient who is \n\"receiving a stable dose of levodopa \", the concurrent administration of safinamide to that patient, \nand explains that safinamide should be given \"while maintaining the patient\" on the stable dose of \nlevodopa . '380 patent at cl. 1. \"[M]aintaining \" appears to refer back to the prior art method, \nrequiring the patient to be \"maintained \" or kept on that same stable dose of levodopa . Indeed, \ndependent claim 53 reflects this concept, requiring that the patient receiving a stable dose of \nlevodopa in claim 1 be administered safinamide for at least 12 weeks. '380 patent at cl. 5. A skilled \nartisan would understand that the patient treated according to claim 5' s method was being \n\"maintain[ ed]\" on the stable levodopa dose for those 12 weeks as well. \nTurning to the specification , it uses \"maintaining \" in other contexts to mean \"keeping.\" For \nexample, the specification describes that \"[ o ]ther symptoms of PD include poor balance, due to \n3 Claim 5 recites: \"The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein safinamide , or \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered for at least 12 weeks.\" \n11 the impairment or loss of the reflexes that adjust posture in order to maintain balance.\" '380 patent \nat 10:47-49. It discusses adding buffers to a formulation in \"amounts sufficient to maintain the \npH\" within a specified range, and explains ways a composition's fluidity \"can be maintained. \" Id. \nat 17: 35-40. \nDuring prosecution , the applicant distinguished the prior art by arguing that it did not teach \nthat the levodopa dose given to patients could \"be maintained without reduction when further \nagents are added to the treatment regimen.\" D.I. 120-21, Ex. T at JA482. Additionally, the \napplicant added the clause \"while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa\" to replace \n\"without reducing the patient's dose of concurrently administered levodopa\" in response to an \nexaminer interview so as to \"align more precisely with written description support in the \nspecification.\" D.I. 120-23, Ex.Vat JA710-71 l. \nThus, the intrinsic record suggests that \"maintaining \" can be understood according to its \nplain and ordinary meaning, which is \"keeping\". The Court will adopt that construction. \nDefendants do not contest this construction , 4 but argue that \"maintaining\" suffers not only \nfrom the same indefiniteness as \"stable dose of levodopa\", but it also introduces \"additional \nindefiniteness: for how long after safinamide is added to the patient's treatment regimen must the \n'stable dose' be maintained , and what is the significance of a change in the patient's levodopa dose \nafter that time?\" D.I. 133 at 25. But for the reasons identified above, including that Defendants ' \ndo not support their indefiniteness arguments with any evidence as to what a person of ordinary \nskill in the art would understand about the claims' scope, Defendants have not met their burden \nand the Court does not find \"maintaining \" to be indefinite. \n4D.I.133 at 25. \n12 C. \"a therapeut ically effective stable dose of levodopa\" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants ' F The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"a dose of levodopa \"a dose of levodopa \nsufficient to treat \"a therapeutically sufficient to treat idiopathic effective stable dose idiopathic Parkinson 's Not amenable to Parkinson's disease oflevodopa\" ('380 disease that is neither construction; indefinite that is neither patent, claim 2) increased nor increased nor decreased \" decreased\" \nPlaintiffs propose construing \"a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa\" as \"a \ndose of levodopa sufficient to treat idiopathic Parkinson 's disease that is neither increased nor \ndecreased\", while Defendants contend that this term is indefinite. D.I. 133 at 30-33. \nPlaintiffs' construction is supported by the intrinsic record. Starting with the claims, claim \n2 of the '3 80 patent recites ( as described above) a method of treating idiopathic PD and explains \nthat to accomplish such treatment , a \"therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa\" is \nadministered concurrently with safinamide. '380 patent at cl. 2. The specification describes \ntreatment kits that \"include a therapeutically effective dose of an agent for treating or at least \npartially alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease (e.g., levodopa plus carbidopa \n(SINEMET\u00ae), levodopa plus controlled release carbidopa (SINEMET\u00ae-CR), levodopa plus \nbenserazi de (MADOP AR\u00ae), levodopa plus controlled release benserazide (MADOP AR\u00ae-HBS), \n[and other Parkinson's agents] and safinamide (or a safinamide derivative) .... \" '380 patent at \n5:54-60. And the prosecution history explains that a \"therapeutically effective\" dose refers to a \n\"clinically-relevant\" dose-that is, a dose that is effective to treat PD. D.I. 120-13, Ex.Lat JA357; \nsee also D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA405 (\"safinamide can be added to a stable and therapeutically \neffective L-dopa regimen, providing additional symptomatic benefit\"). \n13 Thus, the claims read in light of the specification and prosecution history suggest that the \nstable levodopa dose be of an unchanging amount sufficient to achieve the desired goal of treating \nPD. Accordingly, the Court will construe \"a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa \" to \nmean \"a dose oflevodopa sufficient to treat idiopathic Parkinson's disease that is neither increased \nnor decreased. \" \nDefendants argue indefiniteness by incorporating their previous arguments as to \"stable \ndose of levodopa \" and \"maintaining.\" D.I. 133 at 32-33. For the reasons identified above, \nincluding that Defendants ' do not support their assertions with any evidence as to what a person \nof ordinary skill in the art would understand about the claims' scope, Defendants have not met \ntheir burden and the Court does not find \"a therapeuticall y effective stable dose of levodopa \" to \nbe indefinite. \nD. \"high purity ... \" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"high purity safinamide or \nralfinamide or a \npharmaceutically \nacceptable acid salt \"safinamide or \nthereof'/ \"safinamide or ralfinamide or a \nralfinamide or a pharmaceutically \n\"high purity safinamide or pharmaceuticall y acceptable acid salt \nralfinamide salt with a acceptable acid salt Not amenable thereof that has lower \npharmaceutically thereof that has lower to construction ; than 0.03% (by \nacceptable acid\"/ than 0.03% (by weight) indefinite weight) of impurity \nof impurity Ila7 or Ila7 or impurity Ilb8 \n\"high purity safinamide or impurity Ilb8 or their or their \na pharmaceutically pharmaceutically pharmaceutically \nacceptable acid salt acceptable acid salts\" acceptable acid salts\" \nthereof' and not indefinite \n('515 patent, claims 32-35, \n40-44; '485 patent, claim \n37) \n14 The parties principally dispute the meaning of the phrase \"high purity\" in disputed terms \nof the '515 and '485 patents. While Plaintiffs argue that \"high purity\" refers to safinamide and \nralfinarnide preparations with lower than 0.03% by weight of impurities , D.I. 133 at 34, Defendants \ncontend that \"high purity\" refers to the \"overall chemical purity of a safinarnide preparation ,\" \nresulting in a term that is ambiguous and thus, indefinite . Id. at 42. \nStarting with the claims, claim 32 of the '515 patent recites: \n32. High purity safinamide or ralfinamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid \nsalt thereof with a content of the respective impurity (S)-2-[3-(3-fluorobenzyl)-4-\n(3-fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylarnino]propanarnide (Ila) or (S)-2-[3-(2-fluorobenzyl)-\n4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylarnino]propanarnide (lib) [graphic omitted] or their \npharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, which is lower than 0.03% (by weight). \n'515 patent at cl. 32. Defendants argue that \"Plaintiffs ' construction would render half of the claim \nlanguage that starts with 'with a content' completel y superfluous\" because \"high purity\" modifies \n\"safinarnide \" whereas \"lower than 0.03%\" refers \"to a required level of an impurity, \" meaning that \n\"'[h]igh purity' does not modify \"a content of impurity Ila,\" D.I. 133 at 39. But that claim \nlanguage can be read to reflect the inventors ' discovery disclosing a new process for keeping \nspecific toxic impurities below 0.03% by weight in large scale preparations of safinamide and \nralfinarnide. See, e.g., '515 patent at 1:60-2:27 ; 7:1-3, 7:11-22, 7:57-8:7. \nThe specification supports this reading. It consistently uses the phrases \"high purity\", \n\"highly pure,\" and \"high purity degree\" to specify safinamide or ralfinamide preparations that have \nless than 0.03% by weight of impurities Ila and lib and their salts; not to refer to an overall \nchemical purity level: \nMoreover , another object of this invention is to provide \npharmaceutical formulations comprising safinarnide or ralfinarnide \nor a salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, preferably \nmethanesulfonic acid, as the active agents wherein the content of the \nrespective dibenzyl derivatives (Ila) and (Ilb) or the salt thereof with \n15 a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, e.g. methanesulfonic acid, is \nlower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % (by weight) with \nrespect to the above said active agents. These new pharmaceutical \nformulations were neither suggested nor achievable by applying the \npharmaco-toxicological knowledge regarding safinamide and \nralfinamide nor by using these active agents prepared according to \nthe methods available in the state of the art. \nTherefore, said pharmaceutical formulations comprising safinamide \nor ralfinamide or the salts thereof with a pharmaceutically \nacceptable acid, preferably methanesulfonic acid, having the above \nsaid high purity degree constitute a further object of this invention. \nId. at 7:57-8:8; see also id. at 7:50-56 (\"high purity degree\" safinamide or ralfinamide has a content \nof impurities Ila or Ilb or the salts thereof \"lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % by \nweight\"), id. at 8:50-60 (\"high purity safinamide \" has a content of impurity Ila or a salt thereof \n\"lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01% by weight\"), id. at 9:1-12 (\"high purity \nralfinamide\" has a content impurities Ilb or a salt there of \"lower than 0.03%, preferably lower \nthan 0.01 % by weight\"); see also id. at Abstract (\"A process for obtaining therapeutically active \n2-[4-(3-and 2-(fluorobenzyloxy)benzylarnino]propanamides and their salts with pharmaceutically \nacceptable acids with high purity degree, in particular , with a content of dibenzyl derivatives \nimpurities lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % by weight.\"). The specification also \nincludes multiple examples relating to the chemical synthesis of safinamide or ralfinamide of a \n\"High Purity Degree.\" In those examples , the purity information related is the content of impurity \nIla or Ilb by weight. See id. at Examples 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. In view of these citations, Defendants ' \nassertion that \"[n]othing in the specification could possibly lead a POSA to believe that 'high \npurity' refers only to a low level of a specific impurity, such as Ila or Ilb\" is not persuasive. D.I. \n133 at 40. \n16 Defendants, after pointing out that there is \"no definition of 'high purity\"' in the \nspecification, turn to expert testimony to elucidate that term's meaning. Id. But that effort divorces \nclaim construction from the intrinsic record, and cannot be squared in view of the Federal Circuit's \nguidance that \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. \nUsually it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" Phillips, \n415 F.3d at 1315 (quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, Defendants ' view that \"high purity\" refers \nto a \"'high' (but undefined) level of an overall chemical purity of a safinarnide preparation ,\" rather \nthan to any particular impurity, obtains considerably less support in the specification . D.I. 133 at \n40. \nDefendants also argue that, when applying Plaintiffs ' construction to certain unasserted \nclaims of the '515 patent, claim 29 takes on the same scope as claim 12. D.I. 133 at 47-48. Claim \n29 recites: \nThe process as in claim 12 wherein safinamide or ralfinamide or \ntheir pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, have a content of the \nrespective impurity (S)-2-3-(3-fluo robenzyl)-4-(3-\nfluorobenzyloxy)-benzylaminopropana mide (Ila) or (S)-2-3-(2 -\nfluorobenzyl)-4-(2-fluorobenzy loxy)-benzylaminopropanarnide \n(Ilb) [graphic omitted] or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid \nsalts, which is lower than 0.03% (by weight). \nClaim 12 recites: \nThe process as in claim 8 wherein the 4-(3-fluoroben \nZyloxy)benzaldehyde or 4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)benzalde hyde of \nformula (IV a) or (IVb) employed as the starting material to obtain \nthe Schiff base intermediate of formula (Vla) or (Vlb) contains less \nthan 0.03% (by weight), of the respective impurities 3-(3-\nfluorobenzyl)-4-(3-fluorobenzy loxy)benzaldehyde (Va) or 3-(2-\nfluorobenzyl)-4-(2-fluo robenzylox y)benzaldehyde (Vb) [graphic \nomitted] \n17 According to Defendants , the \"'only additional limitation in claim 29 is that the impurities Ila and \nIlb are limited to less than 0.03% by weight. If 'high purity' were defined as the limitation of these \ntwo specific impurities, this additional element in dependent claim 29 would not provide any \nfurther limitation.\" D.I. 133 at 48. But \"claim differentiation is a guide, not a rigid rule, and does \nnot alter a construction otherwise compelled by the intrinsic record.\" Ultravision Techs., LLC v. \nGovision, LLC, No. 2022-1098, 2023 WL 2182285, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 23, 2023) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the intrinsic record indicates that the scope the \npatentee ascribed to \"high purity\" is safinamide or ralfinamide preparations that have less than \n0.03% by weight of impurities Ila and Ilb and their salts. That the patentee also decided to claim \nwith greater particularity that safinamide or ralfinamide impurities are less than 0.03% by weight \nin claim 29 \"does not overcome that conclusion in these circumstances.\" Ultravision , 2023 WL \n2182285, at *4. \nAccordingly , the Court will construe the \"high purity\" terms to mean \"safinamide or \nralfinamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid salt thereof that has lower than 0.03% (by \nweight) of impurity IIa7 or impurity Ilb8 or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts.\" \nDefendants argue that, under Defendants ' proposed construction , the \"high purity\" terms \nare indefinite. D.I. 133 at 37-38. Defendants do not argue indefiniteness under Plaintiffs ' \nconstruction. As the Court has declined to adopt Defendants ' proposed construction, the Court \nconcludes the \"high purity\" terms are not indefinite . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court will adopt the parties' agreed-upon constructions and construe the disputed \nclaim terms as described above. The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum \nOpinion. \n18 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nNEWRON PHARMACEUTICALS S.p.A., \nZAMBON S.p.A., \nMDD US OPERATIONS , LLC, \nPlaintiffs , \nV. \nAUROBINDO PHARMA LIMITED , \nAUROBINDO PHARMA USA INC., \nMSN LABORATORJES PRIVATE \nLIMITED , \nOPTIMUS PHARMA PVT LTD, \nPRJNSTON PHARMACEUTICAL , INC., \nRK PHARMA INC., \nZENARA PHARMA PRJV ATE LIMITED , \nDefendants .
