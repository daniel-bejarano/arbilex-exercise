(D.I. 9) .  It raises a limited issue.  It has been fully \nbriefed.  (D.I. 10, 16, 18).   \n The only issue seriously in dispute is whether I should dismiss the claims of contributory \ninfringement for a lack  of factual support for the legal conclusion that the accused  Arista 7500R \nSeries Switches  are \u201cespecially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement and not a \nstaple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial non -infringing use.\u201d  ( E.g., D.I. \n1, \u00b6 43).     \n I previously stated my understanding of the relevant law . \n\u201cThe Federal Circuit has ruled that affirmatively pleading the absence of substantial non -\ninfringing uses renders the claim plausible if the pleadings do not undermine that \nallegation.\u201d  Merck Sharp  & Dohme  Corp. v.  Teva  Pharma USA,  Inc., 2015 WL 4036951, \nat *7 (July 1, 2015) (citing In  re Bill of  Lading, 681 F.3d [1323, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ]). \n \nExpress  Mobile , Inc. v. Squarespace , Inc., 2021 WL 3772040, at *4 (D. Del. Aug. 25, 2021) .   \n In the present case,  the pleadings do undermine the claim.  There are four asserted patents \nfrom what appear to be four different patent families.  The accused products are switches.  The Page 2 of 2  \n description of t he switches  (other than the specific infringement contentions) is limited.  (D.I. 1 , \n\u00b6 36).   And, it seems, Plaintiff concedes that it could do more.  (D.I. 16 at 13). \n In view of the above, the motion to dismiss (D.I. 9) is GRANTED.  The allegations of \npre-suit indirect infringement are DISMISSED without prejudice.1  The allegations of post -suit \ncontributory infringement are DISMISSED without prejudice.  As to post -suit contributory \ninfringement, Plaintiff is given leave to amend its complaint so long as Plaintiff does so within \nfourteen days. \n IT IS SO ORDERED this 3rd day of March 2023.  \n \n       /s/ Richard G. Andrews ____ \n       United States District Judge  \n \n \n \n1 I reject Defendant\u2019s request that any of the dismissals be with prejudice.  In particular, plaintiffs sometimes \ndiscover information that they do not alr eady  possess.  If they obtain such information, they may, depending upon \ncircumstances, seek to amend their complaint.   "}
