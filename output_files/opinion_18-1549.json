{"case_name": "Fatir v. Connections Community Support Programs, Inc. et al", "case_number": "18-1549", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "01-24-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAMIR FATIR, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCASEY PHELPS , et al., \nDefendants. : Civil Action No. 18-1549-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \n1. Introduction . Plaintiff Amir Fatir, an inmate the James T. Vaughn \nCorrectional Center in Smyrna, Delaware , commenced this action on October 8, 2018, \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging violations of his constitutional rights. (0.1. 2) \nHe appears prose and was granted permission to proceed in forma pauperis. The \nAmended Complaint is the operative pleading. (D.I. 13) Before the Court are \nPlaintiffs request for counsel, motion for reconsideration , motion for recusal, motion for \nan extension of time, and motion to reinstate dismissed defendants . (D.I. 51, 52, 54, \n58, 63) \n2. Background. On March 4, 2021, the Court granted the motion to \ndismiss of medical Defendants Connections Community Support Programs , Inc., \nJefferson A. Fort, Irene Fuh, and Matthew Wofford. (0.1. 46). It also granted in part \nand denied in part the motion to dismiss of State Defendants Casey Phelps, Jason \nRash, James Scarborough , and Marc Richman. Scarborough and Richman were \ndismissed as defendants. The retaliation claims against Phelps and Rash remained . \nIn addition, Plaintiff was given leave to amend the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 Eighth Amendment \nmedical claims against the medical Defendants on or before April 7, 2021. (Id.) \n1 Plaintiff sought, and received, an extension of time to on or before May 21, 2021, to file \nthe amended complaint. (D.I. 47) Prior to the deadline for filing the amended \ncomplaint , Plaintiff filed a request for counsel, a motion for reconsideration of the March \n4, 2021 memorandum opinion and order, a motion for my recusal, and another motion \nfor an extension of time to file an amended complaint. (D.I. 51, 52, 54, 58) On April \n21, 2021, Connections Community Support Programs , Inc. filed a suggestion of \nbankruptcy and on June 7, 2021, the Court entered an order that stayed all proceedings \nagainst Connections Community Support Programs , Inc. and its employees . (D.I. 53, \n59) On December 13, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion to reinstate previously dismissed \ndefendants . (D.I. 63) \n3. Motion for Reconsideration. Plaintiff moves for reconsideration of the \nMarch 4, 2021 memorandum opinion and order on the grounds that the Court \ncommitted clear and manifest injustice by failing to take judicial notice of, or consider, \nPlaintiffs reasoning and arguments against dismissal. (D.I. 52 at 2) Plaintiffs motion \ncontains extensive argument why the claims against the medical Defendants and State \nDefendants Richman and Wofford should not have been dismissed . Plaintiff also \nargues that the Complaint and Amended Complaint met the pleading standards of Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8. (D.I. 56) State Defendants oppose and argue that Plaintiffs motion \nmerely asks this Court to rethink its decision. (D.I. 57) \n4. Plaintiff also moves to reinstate dismissed Defendants Scarborough , \nRash, Richman, Wofford, Fort, and Fuh. (D.I. 62) He argues that Scarborough and \nRichman were dismissed before it could be proven that their behavior as policymakers \ndid not cause the deliberate indifference Plaintiff allegedly suffered by the refusal to \n2 treat his condition and that Wofford, Fort, and Fuh were improperly dismissed because \nConnections filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . (0.1. 63) \n5. The standard for obtaining relief under Rule 59(e) is difficult for Plaintiff to \nmeet. The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to \"correct manifest errors of law \nor fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\" Max's Seafood Cafe ex rel. Lou-Ann, \nInc. v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. 1999). \"A proper Rule 59(e) motion ... \nmust rely on one of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the \navailability of new evidence; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to \nprevent manifest injustice.\" Lazaridis v. Wehmer, 591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir. 2010) \n(citing North River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reinsurance Co., 52 F.3d 1194, 1218 (3d Cir. \n1995)). A motion for reconsideration is not properly grounded on a request that a court \nrethink a decision already made. See Glendon Energy Co. v. Borough of Glendon, 836 \nF. Supp. 1109, 1122 (E.D. Pa. 1993). Motions for reargument or reconsideration may \nnot be used \"as a means to argue new facts or issues that inexcusably were not \npresented to the court in the matter previously decided.\" Brambles USA, Inc. v. \nBlocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990). Reargument, however, may be \nappropriate where \"the Court has patently misunderstood a party, or has made a \ndecision outside the adversarial issues presented to the court by the parties, or has \nmade an error not of reasoning but of apprehension .\" Brambles USA, 735 F. Supp. at \n1241 (D. Del. 1990) (citations omitted); See also D. Del. LR 7.1.5. \n6. The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration which \nprovides great detail on why he believes reconsideration is appropriate. The Court has \nalso reviewed the Complaint , Amended Complaint , the applicable law, and the \n3 Memorandum Opinion and Order at issue, and analyzed the issues while considering \nPlaintiffs motion. Plaintiff is mistaken that medical Defendants Wofford , Fort, and Fuh \nwere dismissed due to Connections' bankruptcy . They were dismissed as defendants \nprior to the time that Connections filed the suggestion of bankruptcy . Notably, Plaintiff \nwas given leave to amend his medical claims against them, although this matter is now \nstayed as to the medical Defendants. Upon review of the record, the Court concludes \nthat Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any of the necessary grounds to warrant a \nreconsideration of the Court's March 3, 2021 Memorandum and Order. Therefore , the \nmotion for reconsideration and the motion to reinstate defendants will be denied. (D.I. \n52, 63) \n7. Request for Counsel. Plaintiff requests counsel or a paralegal to file \nand prepare his second amended complaint. (D.I. 51) He states that the prison where \nhe is held has closed its law library and there is not an adequate library available to him. \n(/d.) Plaintiff argues that preparing an amended complaint is the same as an initial \nfiling and therefore the Court is duty-bound to appoint him counsel or a paralegal. (Id. \nat 2). Plaintiff also seeks counsel on the grounds that his case appears to have merit; \nhis ability to investigate the facts is extremely limited; the case requires extensive \ndiscovery ; there is likely to be conflicting evidence ; he is unable to obtain basic legal \nmaterials ; he is impaired and weakened by a heart attack and surgery; he has difficulty \nfiguring out which prison officials can property be held liable; the case concerns medical \nissues and will likely require the use of expert witnesses ; and he has sought retain \ncounsel without success. Plaintiffs addendum seeks counsel on the grounds that the \nsuggestion of bankruptcy complicates this action and, because he is not experienced in \n4 business or bankruptcy law, he requires an attorney who is. (D.I. 55) \n8. A pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis has no constitutional or \nstatutory right to representation by counsel.1 See Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, \n192 (3d Cir. 2011); Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147,153 (3d Cir. 1993). However, \nrepresentation by counsel may be appropriate under certain circumstances , after a \nfinding that a plaintiff's claim has arguable merit in fact and law. Tabron, 6 F.3d at 155. \n9. After passing this threshold inquiry, the Court should consider a number of \nfactors when assessing a request for counsel. Factors to be considered by a court in \ndeciding whether to request a lawyer to represent an indigent plaintiff include: (1) the \nmerits of the plaintiff's claim; (2) the plaintiff's ability to present his or her case \nconsidering his or her education , literacy, experience , and the restraints placed upon \nhim or her by incarceration ; (3) the complexity of the legal issues; (4) the degree to \nwhich factual investigation is required and the plaintiff's ability to pursue such \ninvestigation ; (5) the plaintiff's capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf; and \n(6) the degree to which the case turns on credibility determinations or expert testimony. \nSee Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498-99 (3d Cir. 2002); Tabron, 6 F.3d at \n155-56. The list is not exhaustive , nor is any one factor determinative . Tabron, 6 F.3d \nat 157. \n10. Several of the Tabron factors militate against granting Plaintiffs request \nfor counsel at this time. Plaintiff is a frequent filer. He has ably represented himself in \n1 See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989) \n(\u00a7 1915(d) (now\u00a7 1915(e)(1)) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling \nattorney to represent an indigent civil litigant, the operative word in the statute being \n\"request.\"). \n5 the past and he continues to do the same in the instant action. Plaintiff complains that \nhe limited law library access, but his filings belie this claim. His recent motion for \nreconsideration is replete with quotations and case cites and his recent motion to \nreinstate defendants is typed. Finally, it is clear from his Complaint and Amended \nComplaint that he understands the issues he raises and adequately addresses those \nissues. Accordingly , reasons, the Court will deny the request for counsel without \nprejudice to renew. \n11. Motion for Recusal. Plaintiff seeks my recusal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n455 and\u00a7 144. (D.I. 54) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a judge is required to recuse \nhimself \"in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned .\" \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The test for recusal under\u00a7 455(a) is whether a \"reasonable \nperson, with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude that the judge's impartiality \nmight reasonably be questioned,\" In re Kensington Int'/ Ltd., 368 F.3d 289, 301 (3d Cir. \n2004), not \"whether a judge actually harbors bias against a party,\" United States v. \nKennedy, 682 F.3d 244, 258 (3d Cir. 2012). Under\u00a7 455(b)(1), a judge is required to \nrecuse himself \"[w]here he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\" \nUnder\u00a7 455(b)(3), a judge is required to recuse himself \"[w]here he has served in \ngovernmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, advisor or \nmaterial witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the \nmerits of the particular case in controversy .\" \n12. With regard to a judge who formerly served in the United States Attorney's \nOffice, \"absent a specific showing that that judge was previously involved with a case \nwhile in the U.S. Attorney's office that he or she is later assigned to preside over as a \n6 judge, \u00a7 455(b)(3) does not mandate recusal.\" United States v. Di Pasquale , 864 F.2d \n271, 279 (3d Cir 1988). Plaintiff offers no evidence that I was involved in this case \nwhile I served in the United States Attorney's Office. He has not established that a \nreasonable person would conclude that my impartiality might be questioned based on \nmy prior employment as the United States Attorney for the District of Delaware or as an \nAssistant United States Attorney. See generally Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, \n555 (1994); Brown v. Mace-Liebson , 779 F. App'x 136, 142-43 (3d Cir. 2019). Plaintiff \nalso takes exception to rulings I have made in this case. This, however, is not a basis \nfor my recusal. After careful and deliberate consideration , I conclude that I have no \nactual bias or prejudice towards Plaintiff and that a reasonable , well-informed observer \nwould not question my impartiality. After considering Plaintiffs assertions , I conclude \nthat there are no grounds for my recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. \n13. Plaintiff has submitted an affidavit to support his motion for my \ndisqualification under\u00a7 144. (0.1. 54 at 5-8) Section 144 provides that \"[w]henever a \nparty to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit \nthat the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either \nagainst him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further \ntherein.\" In the affidavit, Plaintiff states that: (1) he recently learned that while I was the \nU.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware , I was specially detached to the Delaware \nDepartment of Justice to work in partnership with DOJ attorneys to prosecute Thomas \nCapano; (2) he believes that the relationship makes the DOJ opposing counsel my \ndefacto former law partners and equally conflicted regarding private counsel for the \nmedical defendants ; (3) the DOJ represents all State Defendants and the DOC hired \n7 and paid Connections ; and (4) the interlocking relationships among myself, the DOJ, \nthe DOC, and Connections present possible conflicts of interest, personal bias, the \nappearance of impropriety and prejudice against Plaintiffs and prejudice in favor of \nDefendants . (D.I. 54 at 5-8) \n14. As a threshold matter, it is the responsibility of the district judge against \nwhom an affidavit is filed to assess the legal sufficiency of the affidavit. United States \nv. Townsend, 478 F.2d 1072, 1073 (3d Cir. 1973) (stating that the mere filing of an \naffidavit \"does not automatically disqualify a judge\"). The United States Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit has held that the challenged judge must determine only the \nsufficiency of the affidavit, not the truth of the assertions . Mims v. Shapp, 541 F .2d \n415, 417 (3d Cir. 1976). An affidavit is legally sufficient if the facts alleged therein: \n(1) are \"material\" and \"stated with particularity ,\" (2) \"would convince a reasonable \nperson that a bias exists,\" and (3) evince bias that \"is personal, as opposed to judicial, \nin nature.\" United States v. Thompson , 483 F.2d 527, 528 (3d Cir. 1973). \n15. Here, it is evident that Plaintiffs allegations of bias consist of subjective \nconclusions based upon a case I prosecuted over twenty years ago as well as \nconclusory statements of interlocking relationship that pose \"possible \" conflicts of \ninterest. See Jones v. Pittsburgh Nat'/ Corp., 899 F .2d 1350, 1356 (3d Cir.1990) \n(holding that, to be legally sufficient , an affidavit must contain more than mere \nconclusory allegations). Evaluating Plaintiffs affidavit and motion for recusal, I find no \nbasis from which to conclude that the Court has a personal bias or prejudice against \nPlaintiff or in favor of any Defendan t to warrant recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. \nSignificantly , Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of making the threefold showing as \n8 to (1) specific facts (2) that could convince a reasonable person that a bias exists and \n(3) that the bias was personal as opposed to judicial in nature. United States v. \nThompson, 483 F.2d at 528. To the contrary, Plaintiff has presented conclusory and \nbroad statements premised entirely on conjecture. He has not met the requirements of\u00a7 \n144, and his motion for my recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 will be denied. \n16. Motion for Extension of Time. Plaintiff moves for an extension of time \nto file a second amended complaint. (D.I. 58) The motion will be granted. \n17. Conclusion. Based upon the above discussion, the Court will: (1) deny \nwithout prejudice to renew Plaintiffs request for counsel (D.I. 51); (2) deny Plaintiffs \nmotion for reconsideration (D.I. 52); (3) deny Plaintiffs motion for recusal (D.I. 54); (4) \ngrant Plaintiffs motion for an extension of time to file a second amended complaint (D.I. \n58); and (5) deny Plaintiffs motion to reinstate dismissed Defendants (D.I. 63). A \nseparate order shall issue. \nJanuary .2.'t , 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware \n9 Chief Judge IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAMIR FATIR, \nPlaintiff, \nV. : Civil Action No. 18-1549-CFC \nCASEY PHELPS, et al., \nDefendants. \nORDER \nAt Wilmington this 2'( ~day of January, 2022 for the reasons set forth in the \nMemorandum issued this date, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n1.
