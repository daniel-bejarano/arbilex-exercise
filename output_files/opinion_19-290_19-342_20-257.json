Each judgment creditor seeks, through these actions, a writ of \nattachment.fierifacias (''fl.fa.\") for shares of PDV Holding, Inc. (the \"PDVH Shares\") held by \nthe Republic 's state-owned oil company , Petr6leos de Venezuela , S.A. (\"PDVSA\").1 Although \nthe Republic and PDVSA are legally distinct entities, judgment creditors with judgments against \nthe Republic have sought to collect on those judgments by attaching PDVSA's property in this \nDistrict, under the theory that PDVSA is the Republic's alter ego. \nUnder certain executive orders and a sanctions regime implemented by the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment 's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), the PDVH Shares are \"blocked \nproperty,\" so transactions involving those shares are prohibited. Thus, each judgment creditor \nadmits that any writ of attachment for the PDVH Shares should not be served until either OFAC \ngrants it a specific license to obtain an interest in the PDVH Shares or the sanctions regime \nchanges and the PDVH Shares are no longer blocked. One common legal question in all four of \nthese cases is whether the OFAC sanctions should stop the Court from ordering the narrow relief \nrequested by the judgment creditors in their pending motions. For the reasons explained below, \nthe Court concludes that the OFAC sanctions do not prevent it from authorizing the eventual \nissuance of a writ attachment , conditioned on some form of approval by the Executive Branch. \n1 PDVSA wholly owns PDVH, which wholly owns CITGO Holding, Inc., which in turn \nwholly owns CITGO Petroleum Corp. (\"CITGO\"). In practical effect, then, the dispute over the \nPDVH Shares may be viewed as a dispute over ownership interests in CITGO. \n1 BACKGROUND \nI. Parties And Cases \nA. OIEG \nIn 2011, 01 European Group B.V. (\"OIEG\") commenced an arbitration against the \nRepublic. (Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 49 at 2) In 2015, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the \nRepublic, under the regime of former President Hugo Chavez, had expropriated OIEG's interests \nin glass container factories. (Id) The tribunal issued a decision in OIEG's favor and awarded \nOIEG over $370 million, plus costs, expenses, and interest. (Id at 2-3) In 2019, the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the arbitral award and entered judgment for \nOIEG against the Republic. (See id at 3) Later that year, OIEG registered its judgment with \nthis Court. (Id) By OIEG's calculation, the total amount of its award now stands at over $583 \nmillion. (Id) OIEG seeks to collect on its judgment by attaching the PDVH Shares. At this \npoint in the process, OIEG specifically asks the Court to \"enter an order authorizing the issuance \nof ... a writ of attachment fieri facias ... provided that such issuance and service of the writ \nshall be conditioned upon this Court's receipt of evidence that [OFAC] has (x) authorized such \nissuance and service, or (y) removed the prohibition and sanctions currently in place that prevent \nthe issuance and service of such a writ.\" (D.I. 48 at 1-2; D.I. 48-3; see also D.I. 102 at 2)2 \n2 OIEG has occasionally framed its requested relief differently. (See Misc. No. 19-290 \nD.I. 96 at 3) (\"OIEG requests that this Court authorize the issuance of a writ, with service not to \nbe made until and unless OFAC grants a license or lifts the current sanctions, or alternatively \ndeclare OIEG's right to issuance of a writ upon the grant of a license.\") Based on the language \nin OIEG's renewed motion for a writ of attachment (D.I. 48 at 1-2), the proposed order (D.I. 48-\n3), and OIEG's most recent articulation of the requested relief (D.I. 102 at 2), the Court \nunderstands that OIEG is not actually seeking issuance of the writ at this time. \n2 B. Huntington Ingalls \nNorthrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc., now known as Huntington Ingalls Inc. \n(\"Huntington Ingalls\"), commenced an arbitration against the Republic 's Ministry of Defense \nafter the Republic failed to pay Huntington Ingalls for repairing two Venezuelan warships. (See \nMisc. No. 20-257 D.I. 26 at 1 & n.1) In 2018, the arbitral tribunal sided with Huntington \nIngalls, awarding it over $128 million. (Id. at 4) Huntington Ingalls filed a motion in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Mississippi seeking to recognize and enforce its \narbitral award, and that court granted the motion. (Id.) In July 2020, Huntington Ingalls \nregistered its judgment in this Court. (Id. at 5) Today, Huntington Ingalls' judgment is \napparently worth over $137 million. (See id. at 4-5) Like OIEG, Huntington Ingalls seeks to \ncollect on its judgment by attaching the PDVH Shares and obtaining a portion of the proceeds \nfrom a forced judicial sale. Given the sanctions regime, Huntington Ingalls seeks an order that \nthe Clerk of this Court may issue a writ of attachment for the PDVH Shares \"upon evidence that \n[OFAC] has either (i) authorized the issuance and service of such a writ or (ii) otherwise \nremoved or modified the relevant sanctions currently prohibiting the transfer of' the PDVH \nShares. (D.I. 54-1 at 1-2) (emphasis omitted) \nC. ACL \nACLl Investments Ltd. (\"ACLl\"), ACL2 Investments Ltd. (\"ACL2\"), and LDO Cayman \nXVIII Ltd. (\"LDO\") (collectively, \"ACL\") own bonds issued by the Republic. (Misc. No. 21-46 \nD.I. 3 at 10) Because the Republic stopped paying principal and interest on the bonds in \nJanuary 2018, the bonds' full principal became due in December 2018. (Id.) In September \n2019, ACLl and ACL2 sued the Republic in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \n3 New York. (Id.) LDO eventually joined that case. (Id.) At the end of 2020, the Republic \nstipulated to a judgment against it worth over $118 million. (Id.) ACL registered its judgment \nin this Court but also agreed not to enforce that judgment until October 23, 2021. (Id.) Now \nthat the agreed-upon date has passed, ACL seeks to collect on its judgment by attaching the \nPDVH Shares. ACL requests an order with the following language: \"upon this Court's receipt \nof evidence that [OFAC] has either authorized the issuance and service of such writ or removed \nthe prohibition and sanctions currently in place that prevent the issuance and service of such a \nwrit, the Clerk of this Court ... shall issue that writ.\" (D.I. 31 at 1) The proposed order also \nwould provide that \"the U.S. Marshals Service is authorized , upon receipt of the issued writ, to \nserve\" that writ on PDVH. (Id. at 2) \nD. ConocoPhillips \nAccording to Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited and ConocoPhillips \nPetrozuata B.V. (together, \"ConocoPhillips\"), the Republic and PDVSA \"confiscated and \nnationalized ConocoPhillips' interests in major projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt.\" (Misc. No. \n19-342 D.I. 3 at 1) ConocoPhillips commenced an arbitration against the Republic, PDVSA, \nand various subsidiaries of PDVSA. (Id.) The arbitral tribunal awarded ConocoPhillips nearly \n$2 billion. (Id.) In August 2018, the arbitral award was confirmed in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York. (Id.) Notably, unlike the other judgment creditors, \nConocoPhillips holds a judgment directly against PDVSA, meaning that ConocoPhillips is not \nrequired to show that PDVSA is the Republic's alter ego. (See id. at 2-3) The parties entered \ninto a settlement agreement, and PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips a portion of the judgment. (Id. at \n1-2) PDVSA later breached its obligations under the settlement agreement, causing \n4 ConocoPhillips to seek to enforce the judgment and collect the rest of its award, as the settlement \nagreement allows. (Id. at 2) Thus, ConocoPhillips seeks an order \"authorizing the issuance of \nthefi. fa. writ, with subsequent delivery and service conditioned on OFAC authorization (or the \nlifting of sanctions). \" (D.I. 37 at 5) Unlike the other judgment creditors, who suggest there \nshould be conditions on both the issuance and service of their requested writs, ConocoPhillips \nseeks the immediate issuance of its writ with conditions only on service. \nII. Sanctions Regime \nA. Executive Orders \nIn March 2015, the President issued an executive order (\"E. 0. \") declaring a national \nemergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\"IEEPA\"), 50 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1701 et seq., regarding the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. See generally E.O. 13,692, 80 \nFed. Reg. 12,747 (Mar. 8, 2015). For present purposes , two additional executive orders are \nespecially relevant.3 Under E.O. 13,850, 83 Fed. Reg. 55,243 (Nov. 1, 2018), certain \nVenezuelan property in the United States, and interests in that property, \"are blocked and may \nnot be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn , or otherwise dealt in.\" \u00a7 l(a). This prohibition \ndoes not apply \"to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses \nthat may be issued pursuant to\" the executive order. Id. \u00a7 l(b). Similarly , under E.O. 13,884, \n3 The President has issued several other executive orders regarding the humanitarian \ncrisis in Venezuela. See generally E.O. 13,808 \u00a7 l(b), 82 Fed. Reg. 41,155 (Aug. 24, 2017) \n(prohibiting \"[t]he purchase, directly or indirectly, by a United States person or within the United \nStates, of securities from the Government of Venezuela\"); E.O. 13,835 \u00a7 1 (a)(iii), 83 Fed. Reg. \n24,001 (May 21, 2018) (prohibiting transactions related to \"the sale, transfer, assignment , or \npledging as collateral by the Government of Venezuela of any equity interest in which the \nGovernment of Venezuela has a 50 percent or greater ownership interest\"); E.O. 13,857 \u00a7 1, 84 \nFed. Reg. 509 (Jan. 25, 2019) (defining \"Government of Venezuela\" to include PDVSA). \n5 84 Fed. Reg. 38,843 (Aug. 5, 2019), \"[a]ll property and interests in the property of the \nGovernment of Venezuela that are in the United States ... are blocked and may not be \ntransferred, paid, exported, withdrawn , or otherwise dealt in.\" \u00a7 l(a). Like E.O. 13,850, the \nrestrictions in E.O. 13,884 do not apply if a statute, regulation , order, directive, or license states \notherwise. Id. \u00a7 l(c).4 \nB. OFAC Regulations \nOFAC promulgated a regulation under which \"[a]ll transactions prohibited pursuant to\" \nE.O. 13,692 or any other executive orders related to the national emergency involving Venezuela \n\"are prohibited. \" 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.201. A related regulation similarly prohibits \"the \nenforcement of any lien, judgment , arbitral award, decree, or other order through execution, \ngarnishment , or other judicial process purporting to transfer or otherwise alter or affect property \nor interests in property blocked pursuant to\u00a7 591.201,\" unless OFAC has granted a specific \nlicense for that conduct. Id. \u00a7 591.407; see also id. \u00a7 591.506(c) (similar).5 \nAdditional regulations provide definitions for certain terms used in the prohibitions. \n\"Transfer \" means \"any actual or purported act or transaction \" if the \"purpose, intent, or effect\" is \n4 The Court is releasing another Opinion today that contains additional discussion of the \nrelevant executive orders. See generally Crystal lex Int 'l Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, Misc. No. 17-151 D.I. 443 at 18-25 (D. Del. Mar. 2, 2022) (D.I. 443) (\"Crystallex \nSanctions Op.\"). \n5 In Misc. No. 17-151, Crystallex was able to attach the PDVH Shares because \nVenezuelan property in the United States had not yet been blocked when the Court granted relief \nto Crystallex. The OFAC regulations outlined in this section of the Opinion were promulgated \nafter Crystallex obtained its writ of attachment and apply prospectively to any additional writs of \nattachment that may issue. \n6 to \"create, surrender , release, convey, transfer, or alter, directly or indirectly , any right, remedy, \npower, privilege, or interest with respect to any property. \" Id. \u00a7 591.310. That definitional \nprovision also states that \"transfer\" may include, among other things, \"the issuance, docketing , \nor filing of, or levy of or under, any judgment , decree, attachment , injunction , execution , or other \njudicial or administrative process or order, or the service of any garnishment. \" Id. Moreover , \n\"property\" and \"property interest\" are broadly defined to include any \"property, real, personal, or \nmixed, tangible or intangible , or interest or interests therein, present, future, or contingent. \" Id. \n\u00a7 591.309. \nAny transfers of blocked property that occur in violation of OFAC regulations will be \ndeemed to have no legal effect. For example, one provision states: \"[a]ny transfer ... that is in \nviolation of any provision ofthis part ... and that involves any property or interest in property \nblocked pursuant to\u00a7 591.201, is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or \nrecognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to such property \nor property interest.\" Id. \u00a7 591.202(a ). Another provision is specificall y directed to judicial \norders: \"Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment , judgment , decree, lien, execution , \ngarnishment , or other judicial process is null and void with respect to any property and interests \nin property blocked pursuant to\u00a7 591.201.\" Id. \u00a7 591.202(e).6 \nC. FAQ 808 \nIn December 2019, OFAC published guidance in the form of an answer to the following \nfrequently asked question (\"FAQ\"): \n6 See also generally Crystal/ex Sanctions Op. at 21-3 8. \n7 [Q.] 808. Do I need a specific license from OFAC to file a suit \nin U.S. court against a person designated or blocked pursuant to \nVenezuela-related sanctions? Does a U.S. court, or its personnel, \nneed a specific license from OFAC to hear such a case? \n[A.] No. A specific license from OFAC is not ordinarily \nrequired to initiate or continue U.S. legal proceedings against a \nperson designated or blocked pursuant to OFAC's Venezuela \nsanctions program, or for a U.S. court, or its personnel , to hear \nsuch a case. However, a specific license from OFAC is required \nfor the entry into a settlement agreement or the enforcement of any \nlien, judgment , or other order through execution , garnishment , or \nother judicial process purporting to transfer or otherwise alter or \naffect property or interest in property blocked pursuant to the \nVenezuela Sanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 591). This \nincludes the purported creation or perfection of any legal or \nequitable interests (including contingent or inchoate interests) in \nblocked property. While terminology may vary in different \njurisdictions and proceedings , a specific license from OFAC \nwould be required/or measures such as ... [a]ttaching. \n(Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 50-1 Ex. 25) (emphasis added) (citing 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 591.309, 591.310, \n591.407, and 591.506) \nDISCUSSION \nI. The Judgment Creditors Present Issues That Are Ripe For Adjudication \nPDVSA argues that the issues in the judgment creditors ' attachment motions are not ripe \nbecause those motions are contingent on possible future events, such as OFAC's issuance of a \nspecific license. Therefore, in PDVSA's view, the Court lacks jurisdiction . (See, e.g., Misc. \nNo. 19-290 D.I. 65 at 30) The Court concludes that the issues before it are ripe and that it has \njurisdiction. \nPDVSA does not account for all the factors affecting ripeness. At a high level, the \nripeness inquiry involves evaluating \"the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the \n8 hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\" Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. \n136, 149 (1967) (emphasis added), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. \n99 (1977). More specificall y, the \"fitness\" prong of this analysis considers multiple factors: \n(1) \"whether the issue is purely legal (as against factual),\" (2) \"the degree to which the \nchallenged action is final,\" (3) \"whether the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that \nmay not occur as anticipated or at all,\" (4) \"the extent to which further factual development \nwould aid decision,\" and (5) \"whether the parties to the action are sufficiently adverse.\" NE \nHub Partners, L.P v. CNG Transmission Corp., 239 F.3d 333,341 n.8 (3d Cir. 2001). The \n\"hardship\" prong \"focuses on whether a plaintiff faces a direct and immediate dilemma, such that \nlack of review will put it to costly choices.\" Id. 7 \nIn the instant cases addressed in this Opinion, the applicable factors demonstrate that the \nissues before the Court are ripe for adjudication. With respect to the \"hardship\" prong, the \njudgment creditors are faced with a dilemma: if they wait for OFAC to provide additional \nguidance on how far the attachment process can or should go under the current sanctions , OFAC \nmay decide not to provide any guidance at all, leaving the judgment creditors in legal limbo. \nThat position would be costly for the judgment creditors, who all hold substantial judgments \n7 In the context of declaratory judgments , the Third Circuit generally employs a \n\"threefold rubric\" to analyze ripeness. NE Hub Partners, 239 F.3d at 342. The considerations \nin that rubric are (1) \"the adversity of the parties' interests,\" (2) \"the probable conclusiveness of a \njudgment ,\" and (3) \"the practical utility to the parties ofrendering ajudgment.\" Id.; see also \nStep-Saver Data Sys., Inc. v. Wyse Tech., 912 F.2d 643, 647 (3d Cir. 1990). That rubric is just \nanother way to organize the relevant factors. See NE Hub Partners, 239 F.3d at 342 n.9. \nRegardless of how the factors are grouped, the ripeness inquiry is a flexible one. See id. \n9 against the Republic and/or PDVSA and would likely have to wait even longer (than they \notherwise would have to wait) to collect the money owed to them. \nThe \"fitness\" prong also favors ripeness. The Court is focused on the application of the \nOFAC sanctions to a largely undisputed set of facts, leaving the Court to decide purely legal \nI \nissues. (See, e.g., Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 37 at 1) (\"[N]one of the facts are contested. \") Further \nfactual development would not aid the Court's decision on the OFAC issues. Moreover , \nPDVSA ignores that both sides are indisputabl y adverse to each other. To be sure, PDVSA is \nright that the judgment creditors ultimately seek relief that is contingent upon future conduct by a \nthird party (i.e., the Executive Branch). (See Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 22 at 33) But the adversity \nof the parties and their desired outcomes in this litigation are not contingent on anyone or \nanything else. The judgment creditors are asking this Court to provide relief now in the form of \norders that will leave them better prepared to perfect interests in the PDVH Shares at the \nappropriate time. PDVSA opposes this relief and, more broadly, the Republic does not want to \npay the judgments (unless, perhaps, there is a global resolution of all the Republic 's debt).8 \nThe cases cited by PDVSA are inapposite. PDVSA starts with the proposition that '\"[a] \ndispute is not ripe for judicial determination if it rests upon contingent future events that may not \noccur as anticipated , or indeed may not occur at all.\"' (Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 22 at 33) (quoting \n8 See, e.g., Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 65 at 25 (PDVSA referring to Guaid6 administration 's \n\"plan to globally restructure Venezuela 's and PDVSA's debts\"); D.I. 50-1 Ex. 8 (describing \nGuaid6 administration's policies regarding \"the imminent renegotiation of foreign currency\u00ad\ndenominated private claims against the Republic and the Venezuelan public sector\"); see also \nCrystal/ex Int'! Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 932 F.3d 126, 147-48 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(noting that, in 2017, former President Maduro \"decreed that Venezuela would restructure the \nexternal debt of both Venezuela and PDVSA\"). \n10 Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Cnty. of Del., 968 F.3d 264,272 (3d Cir. 2020)) PDVSA's argument \nconflates whether a dispute is contingent with whether the requested relie/involves some kind of \ncontingency. The disputes between the judgment creditors and the Republic and/or PDVSA \nexist regardless of what the Executive Branch does or does not do. OFAC's grant of a specific \nlicense would not obviate the core disputes among these parties; a license would only allow the \nparties to proceed to the next step of resolving that dispute. \nIn another case on which PDVSA relies, Republic of Panama v. Lexdale, Inc., 804 F. \nSupp. 1521, 1522 (S .D. Fla. 1992), Lex dale sued Air Panama for damaging an aircraft that \nLexdale had leased to the airline, and Lexdale eventually obtained a default judgment. In the \nmeantime, and before Lexdale could attempt to enforce its judgment against Air Panama, the \nExecutive Branch blocked Panamanian property in the United States. See id. The Republic of \nPanama brought suit against Lexdale, seeking a declaration that it was not responsible to pay the \ndefault judgment against Air Panama. See id. at 1522-23. The district court dismissed the \nRepublic of Panama's action as unripe because it was unclear whether Lexdale would ever be \nable to seek to enforce the default judgment; it had not yet even threatened or commenced such \nan action. See id. at 1523-24. Here, by contrast, the judgment creditors do not merely hold \njudgments against Venezuela and/or PDVSA. They have already commenced judgment \nenforcement actions in this Court. (See Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 102 at 6-7 (\"OIEG is seeking to \nsatisfy its judgment against specific property of Venezuela's alter ego -there is nothing \nspeculative about its extant claims.\") ; Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 29 at 22 n.11) Thus, the \ncircumstances presented here are not as speculative as those in Lexdale. \n11 Hence, the Court concludes that the judgment creditors' motions present issues that are \nripe for this Court's review , and this Court has jurisdiction .9 \nII. Nothing Prevents The Court From Authorizing The Eventual Issuance Of A Writ Of \nAttachment \nUnder the applicable executive orders, the PDVH Shares \"are blocked and may not be \ntransferred , paid, exported, withdrawn , or otherwise dealt in.\" E.O. 13,850 \u00a7 l(a); E.O. 13,884 \n\u00a7 l(a). By the executive orders' own terms, however, they do not apply \"to the extent provided \nby statutes, or in regulations , orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued.\" E.O. 13,850 \n\u00a7 l(b); E.O. 13,884 \u00a7 l(c) (emphasis added). Here, all but one of the judgment creditors are \nasking for an order authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment , conditioned on \neither OFAC's grant of a specific license or material changes to the sanctions regime (the \n\"requested relief').10 The requested relief, therefore , has no impact on the PDVH Shares unless \nand until the Executive Branch takes action. If the sanctions regime remains in its current form \n9 PDVSA suggests that the Court may not have jurisdiction under Article III of the U.S. \nConstitution to reach the issue of OFAC sanctions . (Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 95 at 2 n.1; Misc. \nNo. 20-257 D.I. 51 at 2 n.1) PDVSA's Article III arguments are vague, but, for the reasons \nexplained above, the Court concludes that the judgment creditors present live cases or \ncontroversies within the meaning of Article III. It may also be that in the instant post-judgment \nposture, a live case or controversy is not required. See generally Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. \n349, 356-57 (1996) (approving \"exercise of ancillary jurisdiction \" in some circumstances \"to \nassist in the protection and enforcement of federal judgments \"). The Court need not decide that \nissue. Because the Court has jurisdiction under Article III, PDVSA agrees that the Court may \nconsider the OFAC issues before turning to the alter ego analysis under the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act. (See Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 95 at 2 n.1; Misc. No. 20-257 D.I. 51 at 2 n.1) \n10 To be precise, OIEG, Huntington Ingalls, and ACL are seeking the requested relief \ndescribed here. ConocoPhillips asks for slightly more relief: the immediate issuance of a writ of \nattachment. In this section of the Opinion, the Court focuses on the reliefrequested by OIEG, \nHuntington Ingalls, and ACL. The Court specificall y addresses ConocoPhillips ' request in the \nnext section. \n12 and OFAC denies the judgment creditors' license requests, PDVSA will retain full ownership of \nthe PDVH Shares (subject to any preexisting liens), leaving the status quo in place. \nAccordingly , the judgment creditors' requested relief does not contravene the plain text of E.O. \n13,850 and E.O. 13,884, which contain an exception for actions taken in accordance with OFAC \nlicenses. \nTurning to the OFAC regulations , PDVSA's argument against the requested relief starts \nwith the premise that 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.407 broadly prohibits any \"judicial process purporting to \ntransfer or otherwise alter or affect property or interests in [blocked] property.\" (See, e.g., Misc. \nNo. 21-46 D.I. 22 at 30) In PDVSA's view, when that prohibition is combined with the broad \ndefinitions of\"transfer\" and \"property\" in\u00a7\u00a7 591.309-10 , the regulations effectively prohibit any \nproceedings involving the PDVH Shares from moving forward. (See, e.g., Misc. No. 19-342 \nD.I. 33 at 12) (\"OFAC regulations broadly prohibit any conceivable steps toward enforcing a \njudgment against blocked property .... \") The Court disagrees with PDVSA's overly expansive \ninterpretation of the regulations. \n\"Transfer\" is defined as any \"act or transaction\" having the \"purpose, intent, or effect\" to \n\"create, surrender, release, convey, transfer, or alter, directly or indirectly , any right, remedy, \npower, privilege, or interest\" with respect to blocked property. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.310. Under this \ndefinition , authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment does not involve any \n\"transfer.\" Rather, only the actual, eventual encumbering of the PDVH Shares with a lien would \n\"create, surrender, release, convey, transfer, or alter\" any right or interest in those shares. (See, \ne.g., Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 35 at 3) (citing Nat'! Oil Corp. v. Libyan Sun Oil Co., 733 F. Supp. \n800, 809-12 (D. Del. 1990)) This interpretation is consistent with the statutory provisions \n13 regarding what the President may control. See 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(l)(B) (granting President \ncertain powers with respect to \"property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has \nany interest\"); see also Nat'! Oil, 733 F. Supp. at 812 (\"[T]he Court concludes that in this case \nthe President does not have the power to prohibit the mere entry of judgment by this Court.\"). If \nthe Court grants the requested relief, no attachment will become effective and no lien will be \ncreated unless and until OFAC grants a specific license or the sanctions regime materially \nchanges. Thus, the requested relief does not come within the definition of \"transfer,\" as it does \nnot have the prohibited \"purpose , intent, or effect.\" It would not affect rights in blocked \nproperty until that property is no longer blocked. \nThe regulations need not, and should not, be read to sweep as broadly as PDVSA \ncontends. Instead, in the Court's view, the sanctions regime bars \"the creation ... of any lien\" \nand the other acts called out in \u00a7 591.310 that have the imminent or actual \"purpose, intent, or \neffect\" of altering blocked property rights without an OFAC license. The requested relief does \nnot do so. Notably, the judgment creditors admit that the requested relief will not establish \npriority in the PDVH Shares. (E.g., Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 92 (Apr. 30, 2021 Tr.) at 170; D.I. \n102 at 4 n.6; see also Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 41 (June 9, 2021 Tr.) at 52, 54-55 (ConocoPhillips \nconceding that even issuance of writ of attachment does not establish priority)) The lack of any \npriority benefit underscores that the requested relief does not amount to a prohibited transfer or \notherwise alter rights in the PDVH Shares.11 \n11 Nonetheless , as ConocoPhillips explains , the relief sought by the judgment creditors \n\"has genuine utility because with it, [ each judgment creditor] will be in a position to perfect a \njudgment lien against the shares of PDVH once authorized by OFAC or when sanctions are \n14 Another regulation defines \"interests\" to include interests \"of any nature whatsoever , \ndirect or indirect.\" 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.305. Relatedly, 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.309 defines \"property\" to \ninclude \"future[] or contingent \" property interests. Based on these provisions, PDVSA contends \nthat authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment would establish a prohibited \ncontingent interest in blocked property. (See, e.g., Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 22 at 31-32) The \nCourt disagrees . In the Court's view, the definitions of \"interests\" and \"property \" are intended \nto encompass rights that could mature into present property interests without a specific license \nfrom OFAC. One example of such an interest is a contingent reversionary interest in funds that \nwould go to a foreign government unless a contracting party demonstrates tender of goods. See, \ne.g., Consarc Corp. v. Iraqi Ministry, 27 F.3d 695, 702 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (applying Iraqi sanctions \nto letters of credit). Contrary to PDVSA's argument , therefore , the Court's interpretation of the \nsanctions regime does not render superfluous the portions of the definitions emphasized by \nPDVSA. Rather, those portions of the definitions encompass certain transactions that might \notherwise evade OFAC's scrutiny. Authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment \ncontingent on an OFAC license or material modification of the sanctions does not establish a \n\"contingent\" property interest prohibited by the regulations . 12 \nlifted, without the need for further proceedings before the Court.\" (Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 37 at \n2) ( emphasis omitted) \n12 Framed differently, the Court agrees with ACL that the judgment creditors are seeking \n'\"merely an expectancy and not a property right.\"' (Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 3 at 18) ( quoting In re \nFin. Oversight & Mgmt. Ed.for PR., 948 F.3d 457,468 (1st Cir. 2020)) The judgment creditors \nhave no control over whether the Executive Branch will permit them to obtain any stake in the \nPDVH Shares. See, e.g., In re Majestic Star Casino, LLC, 716 F.3d 736, 756-57 (3d Cir. 2013) \n(explaining that company 's status as \"S\" corporation is not property interest because that status \nmay be revoked \"at will\"). \n15 Under the sanctions regime, an action that is conditioned on OFAC's approval does not \namount to a \"contingent \" property interest. In the Crysta/lex case, PDVSA points to an \nenforcement action in which OFAC arguably took the opposite view. (See Misc. No. 17-151 \nD.I. 419 at 4) In that enforcement action, OFAC concluded that Aero Sky violated the Iranian \nsanctions regime when it entered into a memorandum of understanding with Mahan Air, an \nIranian commercial airline company, even though the agreement was \"contingent , in part, upon \nMahan Air being removed\" from OFAC's list of specially designated nationals and blocked \npersons. (D.I. 420-1) Based on the Court's reading of the Venezuelan sanctions , as explained \nabove, the Court will not defer to OFAC's interpretation of different sanctions in an unrelated \ncase, particularl y when the accused violator in that case never had a chance to defend itself \nbefore the agency. See generally Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019) (holding that \"a \ncourt should not afford ... deference unless the regulation is genuinely ambiguous \"). \nFollowing PDVSA's arguments to their full extent would lead to illogical consequences. \nFor example, if PDVSA's interpretation of the sanctions were correct, then the Court's issuance \nof the instant Opinion could arguably be considered an action that alters rights in the PDVH \nShares (because it is a necessary step toward the judgment creditors collecting on their \njudgments) , even without the Court entering any corresponding order. Yet OFAC has never \nexpressed a belief that its regulations prevent this Court from proceeding in these cases as it \ndeems fit. Indeed, the United States has told this Court that it \"can do whatever it wants.\" \n(Misc. No. 17-151 D.I. 226 at 105) And for good reason: the Executive Branch's attempted \nrestriction of this Court's ability to enforce its judgments would raise serious separation-of\u00ad\npowers concerns. See generally Peacock, 516 U.S. at 356 (noting courts' \"inherent power to \n16 enforce [their]judgments\"); Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Fernandez, 741 F.2d 355,360 n.16 \n(11th Cir. 1984) (\"Simply because Congress empowers the Executive to forbid certain transfers \nof property and he [ or she] acts thereon does not imply that the jurisdiction of the federal courts \nis dependent upon the issuance of a license by the Treasury Department.\").13 \nEven if authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment might somehow be \nconsidered to violate the sanctions regime, OFAC may still validate that action by later granting \na specific license. See 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.202( c ). This potentiality makes the Court far less \nconcerned than PDVSA that whatever the Court accomplishes now might later be considered \n\"null and void.\" (E.g., Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 33 at 14; Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 22 at 32; see also \n31 C.F.R. \u00a7 591.202(a), (e)) The PDVH Shares will not be transferred without ajudgment \ncreditor obtaining a specific OFAC license or the sanctions regime changing. While the Court is \nnot eager to encourage further litigation about the validity of steps taken during this litigation, \nthe Court will not be deterred from fulfilling its judicial function at this time. \nFinally, PDVSA relies on FAQ 808 as further support for its broad interpretation of the \nOFAC regulations. That informal guidance document states that \"a specific license from OFAC \nis required for ... the enforcement of any lien, judgment, or other order through execution, \ngarnishment, or other judicial process purporting to transfer or otherwise alter or affect property \n13 For similar reasons, the Court concludes that no OFAC license is required before it \nmay issue findings of fact regarding whether PDVSA is the Republic's alter ego. (See, e.g., \nMisc. No. 19-290 D.I. 102 at 2 n.3 (\"An alter ego finding does not change ownership of the \nproperty; it simply recognizes the true state of affairs.\") ( emphasis omitted); see also Misc. No. \n20-257 D.I. 54 at 6-7) As explained below, the Court will not be mak:irig any alter ego findings \nat this time in the OIEG, Huntington Ingalls, and ACL cases, but this is based on the Court's \nexercise of its discretion -not due to any lack of jurisdiction or authority. \n17 or interest in property blocked pursuant to the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations .\" (Misc. No. \n19-290 D.I. 50-1 Ex. 25) That language in FAQ 808 tracks the language of the regulations , so \nthe Court's analysis of the regulations applies with equal force to FAQ 808. The FAQ goes on \nto state that prohibited transfers may include the \"purported creation or perfection of any legal or \nequitable interests (including contingent or inchoate interests) in blocked property.\" (Id.) \nAgain, as already explained , authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment does not \ncreate or perfect any interest in the PDVH Shares, which remain PDVSA's property unless and \nuntil OFAC permits otherwise. And while FAQ 808 indicates that a specific license would be \nrequired to attach any blocked property, the requested relief stops short of any attachment. See, \ne.g., Casa Express Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 492 F. Supp. 3d 222, 228 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020) (explaining that parties are not prohibited from taking \"legal actions that stop \nshort of transferring control of property\"). Accordingl y, the Court concludes that FAQ 808 does \nnot meaningfully bolster PDVSA's interpretation of the OFAC sanctions or preclude this Court \nfrom granting the proposed relief.14 \nIn sum, the OFAC sanctions regime does not require a specific license before the Court \nmay enter an order authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment.15 \n14 Given the Court's reading of FAQ 808, the Court need not conclusively determine \nwhether any deference is due to OFAC's statements in FAQ 808. But if FAQ 808 were read to \nbe in tension with the Court's decision, the Court would likely conclude that no deference is due \nto such informal guidance. See Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2415-17; see also Crystallex Sanctions Op. \nat 25-28 (holding that OFAC's FAQ 809 does not warrant deference). \n15 PDVSA has moved to strike (Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 99) the Declaration of John E. \nSmith (D.I. 97), a former Director of OFAC, which OIEG attached to its opening post-hearing \nbrief (D.I. 96; see also D.I. 100, 102, 104, 105). The Court will deny PDVSA's motion as moot, \n18 III. The Court Will Not Immediately Issue A Writ Of Attachment \nUnlike the other judgment creditors, ConocoPhillips asks not that the Court indicate it \nwill eventually issue a writ of attachment , but, instead, to immediately issue a writ of attachment \nwhile delaying delivery and service of the writ until after OFAC grants a specific license or the \nsanctions regime materially changes. (Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 37 at 5) The Court will not go as \nfar as ConocoPhillips requests. \nAs a preliminary matter, PDVSA argues that ConocoPhillips was required to obtain an \nOFAC license before it could even register its judgment in this Court. (See D.I. 11 at 13-14; D.I. \n33 at 12-13) The Court rejects that argument and will not vacate ConocoPhillips ' registered \njudgment. Separate and apart from any motion for a writ of attachment, ConocoPhillips ' \nregistration of its judgment in this Court is not connected to any specific blocked property, such \nas the PDVH Shares. Because registering a judgment in this Court has no effect on any blocked \nproperty, the OFAC regulations are not implicated. (See D.I. 13 at 5) (\"[T]he entry of a money \njudgment is merely evidence of a debt and it does not alone have any property-law \nconsequences.\") Indeed, FAQ 808 explicitly states that \"[a] specific license from OFAC is not \nordinarily required to initiate or continue U.S. legal proceedings against a person designated or \nblocked pursuant to OFAC's Venezuela sanctions program, or for a U.S. court, or its personnel , \nto hear such a case.\" (Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 50-1 Ex. 25) Although this case is a judgment \nenforcement action, not an action to determine liability, the Court discerns no persuasive reason \nwhy the procedural posture would warrant a different outcome. See, e.g., Koch Minerals Sari v. \nas the Court has disregarded the declaration and not relied on it or any reference to it in OIEG's \npost-hearing briefs. \n19 Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , 514 F. Supp. 3d 20, 44 (D.D.C. 2020) (explaining that no \nOFAC license is required until judgment creditor \"reach[es] into PdVSA's pockets\").16 \nThe Court now turns to ConocoPhillips' request that a writ of attachment should issue \nimmediately . Its argument is based on the point at which a lien on attached property is created \nunder Delaware law. The relevant statute provides: \"An execution shall not bind goods and \nchattels until it is delivered to the sheriff or other proper officer to be executed. An execution \nshall, from the time it is so delivered , bind all the goods and chattels of the defendant within the \nbailiwick .... \" 10 Del. C. \u00a7 5081. In some cases, Delaware courts have explained that a lien \non attached property is not actually perfected upon delivery (as the statute might suggest) but \nupon levy by the sheriff. See, e.g., In re Stanley s Asphalt Paving, Inc., 353 B.R. 63, 65 (Del. \nBankr. 2006). According to ConocoPhillips , because delivery is the earliest possible time that a \nlien could be perfected , \"there can be no dispute that the mere issuance of afi. fa. writ is \nincapable of affecting any interest in any property.\" (Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 35 at 6) (emphasis \nomitted) Thus, the Court need not determine at precisely which point a lien is perfected under \nDelaware law. \nNo matter when a lien is created, the Court concludes that now is not the appropriate time \nto issue a writ of attachment. Notably, the other judgment creditors besides ConocoPhillips all \nbelieve that any writ of attachment should not issue unless and until the Executive Branch \n16 PDVSA's reliance (see, e.g., Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 33 at 12; D.I. 36 at 3-4) on Dean \nWitter is not persuasive. In that case, the Eleventh Circuit recognized that Cuban sanctions \nforbade \"only those judicial acts that transfer a property interest.\" Dean Witter, 741 F.2d at 361-\n62. As this Court has explained, here no property interests have yet been transferred. To the \nextent Dean Witter might be read to suggest that sanctions are implicated as soon as liability has \nbeen established in a case involving a foreign entity, Dean Witter is not binding on this Court. \n20 permits them to move forward. (Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 3 at 17 (ACL conceding that \"OFAC \nregulations presently bar the issuance and service of a writ of attachment\"); Misc. No. 19-290 \nD.I. 102 at 2 (OIEG explaining that it \"has carefully crafted its requested relief to expressly stop \nshort\" of implicating sanctions regime, given that \"issuance and service of the requested writ \nwould be conditioned on OFAC's approval\") (emphasis omitted); Misc. No. 20-257 D.I. 54-1 at \n1-2 (Huntington Ingalls proposing relief in form of order that places conditions on issuance and \nservice of writ); see also Crystallex , 2021 WL 129803, at *8 (\"[T]he current sanctions regime \ndoes appear to block issuance of new writs of attachment on Venezuelan assets in the United \nStates without an OFAC license .... \"), appeal dismissed, 24 F.4th 242 (3d Cir. 2022)) For the \nreasons explained above, in the Court's view, issuing a writ of attachment does not necessarily \nhave the actual or imminent \"purpose, intent, or effect\" of altering rights in blocked property, \nbecause no lien would be created until the writ is at least delivered (and perhaps not until it is \nserved). So the Court does not lack the authority to grant ConocoPhillips ' proposed relief. \nNevertheless, given the small difference between (i) authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ \ndependent on OFAC approval and (ii) issuing the writ now with delivery and service dependent ' \non OFAC approval, the Court concludes that the more prudent approach is to delay issuance of \nany writ of attachment until OFAC grants a specific license or the sanctions regime materially \nchanges. \nFrom the perspective of judicial administration , it makes sense that ConocoPhillips and \nthe other judgment creditors will all have access to the same form of relief at the same point in \ntheir judgment enforcement efforts. The Court recognizes that because ConocoPhillips holds a \njudgment directly against PDVSA, if OFAC grants a specific license or the sanctions regime \n21 materially changes, ConocoPhillips will almost certainly be in a better position than the other \njudgment creditors to establish its priority in the PDVH Shares by perfecting a lien. Unlike the \nother judgment creditors, ConocoPhillips will not need to demonstrate that PDVSA is the \nRepublic 's alter ego. Thus, the Court's approach regarding the relief to be awarded at this time \nwill not prejudice ConocoPhillips , which remains at an advantage over the other judgment \ncreditors. 17 \nAccordingly , the Court will not issue a writ of attachment in ConocoPhillips' case at this \ntime. But because no other obstacles prevent the Court from granting ConocoPhillips some \nrelief (as explained further below), the Court will enter an order authorizing the eventual \nissuance of a writ of attachment in ConocoPhillips ' case, conditioned on receipt of evidence that \nConocoPhillips has obtained a specific license from OFAC or that the sanctions regime has \nmaterially changed. \nIV. A Reasonable Amount Of Time Has Passed Since The Judgments Were Entered \nEach of Huntington Ingalls, ACL, and ConocoPhillips seeks an order that a reasonable \nperiod of time has elapsed following entry of judgment in its favor. (See generally Misc. No. \n19-342 D.I. 3 at 7-9; Misc. No. 20-257 D.I. 4 at 9-11; Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 3 at 18-19)18 \n17 To the extent ConocoPhillips is further requesting that \"the Court ... formally add \nConocoPhillips ' judgment to the sale process in Crystal/ex\" (Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 35 at 7), that \nrequest is denied. The Court has not been persuaded that ConocoPhillips' judgment should be \nadded to the sale process in Crystal/ex unless ConocoPhillips establishes a concrete interest in \nthe PDVH Shares, which cannot occur until ConocoPhillips obtains a specific license from \nOFAC or the sanctions regime materially changes. \n18 The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia already determined that a \nreasonable period of time has elapsed since entry ofOIEG'sjudgment. (See Misc. No. 19-290 \n22 Because a reasonable period of time has elapsed since the entry of each judgment , the Court will \nenter an order to that effect. \nUnder the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, attachment of foreign property in the \nUnited States cannot occur until a court has \"determined that a reasonable period of time has \nelapsed following the entry of judgment and the giving of any notice required. \" 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1610( c ). There is no precise definition or formula for determining whether a period of time is \n\"reasonable. \" To make this determination , other courts have looked at several factors, including \n\"the procedures necessary for the foreign state to pay the judgment (such as the passage of \nlegislation) , evidence that the foreign state is actively taking steps to pay the judgment , and \nevidence that the foreign state is attempting to evade payment of the judgment. \" Ned \nChartering & Trading, Inc. v. Republic of Pakistan, 130 F. Supp. 2d 64, 67 (D.D.C. 2001). \nIn this case, at least 14 months have passed since entry of each judgment. Huntington \nIngalls' judgment was entered over a year and a half ago, in June 2020. (Misc. No. 20-257 D.I. \n1) ACL and the Republic stipulated to ~ntry of ACL's judgment 14 months ago, in December \n2020. (Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 4-1 Ex. 37) ConocoPhillips ' judgment was entered three and a \nhalf years ago, in August 2018. (See Misc. No. 19-342 DJ. 4-3) The Republic and PDVSA \nhave had ample time since the entry of these judgments to pay them, but they have not done so. \nRather, they have staunchly opposed the judgment creditors' collection efforts at every turn. \nDJ. 49 at 22; see also DJ. 4-4) In OIEG's case, more than five months passed between entry of \njudgment and the D.C. District Court's finding that a reasonable period had elapsed. (DJ. 50-1 \nEx. 3 at 4) Because this Court need not make another such determination with respect to \nOIEG's judgment , OIEG has not asked for one. \n23 Under the circumstances presented here, the Court concludes that the periods of time that have \nelapsed are more than reasonable.19 \nThe Court's conclusion is further supported by similar decisions from other district \ncourts, which have held that even shorter periods of time are reasonable. See, e.g., Pharo Gaia \nFund Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , 2021 WL 2168916, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, \n2021) (seven months); OJ Eur. Grp. B. V v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 419 F. Supp. 3d 51, \n54 (D.D.C. 2019) (five months); Saint Gobain Performance Plastics Eur. v. Bolivarian Republic \nof Venezuela, 2021 WL 6644369, at *2 (D.D.C. July 13, 2021) (four months); see also Ned \nChartering, 130 F. Supp. 2d at 67 (D.D.C. 2001) (six weeks); Karaha Bodas Co . v. Perusahaan \nPertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 2002 WL 32107929, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 25, \n2002) (fifty days). \nPDVSA argues that a reasonable amount of time has not elapsed because the Republic \nhas been unable to pay the judgment creditors due to the OFAC sanctions. (Misc. No. 19-342 \nD.I. 11 at 15; Misc. No. 20-257 D.I. 32 at 34; Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 22 at 35) That position is \nunpersuasive . OFAC granted ConocoPhillips a license to collect payments from the Republic \npursuant to a settlement agreement. (Misc. No. 19-342 D.I. 13 at 2) If the Republic were \nserious about immediately paying off its outstanding debts, it could and would have paid \nConocoPhillips pursuant to its agreement. It did not do so, and it has made no discemable \nefforts to pay any of the other judgment creditors whose judgments are the subject of this \n19 For ACL, whose judgment was entered most recently, \"[t]he period of time is \nparticularly reasonable ... because it was agreed upon by Venezuela itself' when ACL and the \nRepublic stipulated that ACL would not seek to enforce the judgment until October 2021. \n(Misc. No. 21-46 D.I. 3 at 19) \n24 Opinion, which persuades the Court that Venezuela does not intend ( at least at this time) to pay \nthe judgments. \nRegardless , the statute requires only that a reasonable amount of time has elapsed -\nwhich it has. The impact of the regulations, whatever it may have been, does not alter the plain \nlanguage of the statute. See Saint Gobain, 2021 WL 6644369, at *3 (\"[Plaintiff's] failure to \nobtain a proper OFAC license is ... irrelevant to this Court's decision under\u00a7 1610(c).\"); see \nalso id. at *2 (\"[T]he political reality in Venezuela is a factor generally outside the considerations \na court should analyze when determining whether a reasonable time has elapsed since entry of \njudgment under\u00a7 1610(c).\"); see also Red Tree Jnvs., LLC v. Petr6leos de Venezuela , SA., 2020 \nWL 209290, at *3 (S.D.N.Y . Jan. 14, 2020) (denying stay request). \nIn sum, the Court concludes that reasonable periods of time have passed since Huntington \nIngalls', ACL's, and ConocoPhillips ' judgments were entered. \nV. The Court Is Inclined To Certify Interlocutory Appeals \nAs noted above, today the Court is also releasing the Crystal lex Sanctions Op., which \ninvolves similar, yet distinct issues about the OFAC sanctions regime. In that case, Crystallex \nsuccessfully attached the PDVH Shares before they became blocked. The parties in Crysta/lex \ndispute how far the Court may proceed toward a judicial sale of the PDVH Shares while the \ncurrent OFAC sanctions remain in place. As the Court reads the OFAC sanctions, the Court \nmay take prefatory steps toward a sale of the PDVH Shares, including: (i) entering a Sale \nProcedures Order, (ii) working with a Special Master to implement that order, and (iii) selecting \na winning bidder. The Court will not, however, permit the sale to close, which would result in \n25 transferring legal title to the PDVH Shares. The Court's approach in Crystal/ex is consistent \nwith its approach here of taking steps that fall short of issuing a writ of attachment. \nThe OFAC sanctions have played a prominent role in Crystal/ex and all the other cases \ninvolving judgments against the Republic and/or PDVSA. The Court has spent a great deal of \ntime over the past year analyzing the sanctions regime, which is complicated and presents many \nchallenging issues for these related litigations. The Court is confident it has reached the best \ndecisions it possibly can, but also recognizes there is substantial ground for difference of opinion \non how the sanctions apply to these cases. If a reviewing court were to adopt an interpretation \nof the OFAC sanctions that differs from the Court's interpretation, that controlling legal \ndevelopment might effectively halt all proceedings before this Court in Crystal/ex and/or these \nother judgment enforcement actions. Given that possibility, immediate appeals from the Court's \norders may materially and efficiently advance this litigation by conclusively resolving how far \nthis Court may proceed under the current OFAC sanctions regime. Therefore , it may be \nappropriate for the Court to certify interlocutory appeals in these cases (and in Crysta/lex) so that \nthe Third Circuit may consider all the cross-cutting OFAC issues at the same time, before the \nCourt undertakes the implementation of sale procedures. See generally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). \nThus, the Court will direct the parties in Crysta/lex and the cases that are the subject of this \nOpinion to provide their positions on potential interlocutory appeals. \nVI. The Court Is Not Making Any Alter Ego Factual Findings At This Point \nIn April 2021, the Court presided over an extensive (remote) evidentiary proceeding in \nthe OIEG and Huntington Ingalls cases. At these hearings, those judgment creditors attempted \nto prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that PDVSA was the Republic's alter ego as of that \n26 time. (See Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 49 at 23-33; Misc. No. 20-257 D.I. 26 at 9-19; see also Misc. \nNo. 21-46 D .I. 3 at 10-15)2\u00b0 The Court previously held that the relevant time at issue in \nconnection with the alter ego determination is \"the period between the filing of the motion \nseeking a writ of attachment and the subsequent issuance and service of that writ.\" Crystallex , \n2021 WL 129803, at *6. If the Court certifies interlocutory appeals in Crystallex and these \ncases, a significant additional amount of time will likely pass before proceedings will continue in \nthe instant actions in this Court. Even though OIEG and Huntington Ingalls already had a \nchance in April 2021 to offer evidence regarding PDVSA's status as the Republic's alter ego at \nthat time, another evidentiary hearing may be necessary for the Court to consider any further \ndevelopments before the end of the relevant time period. Hence, the Court is inclined to deny \nOIEG's, Huntington Ingalls', and ACL's pending attachment motions, PDVSA's pending motions \nto dismiss, and any other pending motions without prejudice , allowing any motions to be refiled \nonce the Court has the benefit of any decisions issued as a result of the interlocutory appeals (if \nthey occur). In the forthcoming status report, the parties should provide their views on this \napproach. \n20 The Court is declining to make findings of fact, notwithstanding certain of the \njudgment creditors' efforts to make a record on which such findings could be based, because it \nhas concluded that it should first issue its legal conclusions about the impact of the sanctions and \ndetermine whether to certify an interlocutory appeal of those conclusions. The Court's decision \nto refrain, at this time, from making findings of fact is not due to its agreement with PDVSA that \nOFAC sanctions prohibit the Court from issuing findings of fact that may support issuance and \nservice of a writ or that such findings would violate Article III doctrines. (See Misc. No. 20-257 \nD.I. 51 at 7-13) The Court does not agree with PDVSA on these points. \n27 CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court has jurisdiction over the judgment creditors' \nmotions. Further, the Court has concluded that no executive order, regulation, or guidance \ndocument that has been cited prevents the Court from authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ \nof attachment contingent on grant of an OFAC license or material modification of the sanctions \nregime. The Court has also determined that reasonable amounts of time have passed since \nHuntington Ingalls', ACL's, and ConocoPhillips' judgments were entered. Accordingly, the \nCourt will grant in part ConocoPhillips' motion for a writ of attachment. An appropriate order \nfollows. \n28 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nor EUROPEAN GROUP B.V., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA, \nDefendant. \nPHILLIPS PETROLEUM COMPANY VENEZUELA \nLIMITED and CONOCO PHILLIPS PETROZUATA B.V., \nPlaintiffs \nV. \nPETROLEOS DE VENEZUELA , S.A., \nCORPOGUANIPA , S.A. and PDVSA PETRO LEO, S.A., \nDefendants. \nNORTHROP GRUMMAN SHIP SYSTEMS , INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nTHE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OF THE REPUBLIC OF \nVENEZUELA, \nDefendant. \nACLl INVESTMENTS LTD.,ACL2 INVESTMENTS \nLTD., and LDO (CAYMAN) XVIII LTD., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA , \nDefendant.
