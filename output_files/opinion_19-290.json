Specifically , Venezuela is the 100% owner of \nPetr6leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\"), which in turn owns 100% of PDV Holding, Inc. \n(\"PDVH\"), which itself owns 100% of CITGO Holding, Inc., which in turn owns CITGO \nPetroleum Corp. (\"CITGO\"). \nIn this Opinion, the Court addresses motions for a writ of attachment fieri facias filed by \nfour judgment creditors of Venezuela. 01 European Group B.V. (\"OIEG\") and Northrop \nGrumman Ship Systems, Inc. (now known as Huntington Ingalls Inc.) (\"Huntington\") filed \nmotions that are fully briefed and opposed by one or more of Venezuela, PDVSA, PDVH, and/or \nCITGO (collectively, hereinafter the \"Venezuela Parties\").1 The Court conducted an evidentiary \nhearing in connection with OIEG's and Huntington 's motions, via remote videoconferencing \ntechnology, on April 30, 2021. (See Misc. No. 19-290 (\"OIEG Action\") D.I. 92; Misc. No. 20-\n1 See, e.g., Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 2-6, 11-12, 14-15, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27-30, 33, 36, 39-40, 44, \n46, 48-52, 57, 64-70, 73-74, 77-82, 86-87, 90, 93, 95-107, 111-13, 115, 117, 119, 121-26; Misc. \nNo. 20-257 D.I. 3-6, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, 25-29, 31-40, 42, 45-46, 48-49, 51-54, 56, 60-61, 63-65, \n67, 69, 71-74. \nThe Republic of Venezuela has entered an appearance only in one of the four actions \nunder consideration in this Opinion (the OJEG Action, see Misc. No. 19-290 D.I. 32). PDVSA \nhas intervened in all four actions and has supplied the bulk of the briefing and evidence in \nopposition to the creditors' motions. For simplicity , the Court refers to all of the Republic , \nPDVSA, PDVH, and the CITGO entities collectively as the \"Venezuela Parties,\" although it \nshould be understo9d that: (i) in reality, almost always what the Court attributes to the \n\"Venezuela Parties\" is only explicitly advocated by PDVSA; and (ii) the Court's stylistic \nconvention has no impact on its substantive decision (i.e., that PDVSA is the alter ego of \nVenezuela, a decision grounded in the evidence). \n1 257 (\"Huntington Action\") D.I. 47; see also OIEG Action D.I. 92 (April 30, 2021 hearing \ntranscript)) \nThe Court is also addressing similar motions filed by two additional judgment creditors: \nACLl Investments Ltd., ACL2 Investments Ltd., and LDO (Cayman) XVIII Ltd. (collectively, \n\"ACL\") and Rusoro Mining Ltd. (\"Rusoro\"). ACL's and Rusoro's motions are opposed by \nPDVSA and are fully briefed.2 \nTo prevail on their motions, the creditors must prove that, at the pertinent time, PDVSA \nwas and/or is the alter ego of Venezuela. The Court granted a similar motion in August 2018. \nSee Crystal/ex Int'! Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venez., 333 F. Supp. 3d 380,412 (D. Del. \n2018) (\"Crystal/ex I\"), aff'd, 932 F.3d 126 (3d Cir. 2019) (\"Crystal/ex IF'). In a (still-pending) \ncase filed by Crystallex International , Inc. (\"Crystallex\"), the Court found that as of August 2018 \nPDVSA was the alter ego of Venezuela , and issued and served a writ of attachment on PDVSA's \nshares of PDVH. After that date, developments in Venezuela and the United States complicated \nthe situation. In particular , U.S. sanctions on transactions involving Venezuelan property were \nexpanded and the U.S. government recognized Juan Guaid6, the leader of the Republic 's \nNational Assembly , as the legitimate head of the Venezuelan government , instead ofNicolas \nMaduro, who holds the title of President of the Republic. \nOIEG and Huntington come to this Court with overlapping but distinct theories as to how \nPDVSA remains Venezuela 's alter ego. OIEG emphasizes the Guaid6 government 's (\"Guaid6 \nGovernment\") direction and control over PDVSA's operations in the United States. As an \nalternative, OIEG argues that the Maduro regime's (\"Maduro Regime\") control on the ground in \n2 See, e.g., Misc. No. 21-46 (\"ACL Action\") D.I. 2-8, 15-18, 20-32, 35, 37-38, 41-42, 44, 46, 49-\n52; Misc. No. 21-481 (\"Rusoro Action\") D.I. 2-5, 8, 10, 14, 16-19, 21-22, 24-26, 28, 30, 32-39. \n2 Venezuela, including its control over PDVSA's operations there, is an independent and adequate \nbasis for deeming PDVSA the Republic 's alter ego. For its part, Huntington also focuses on the \nGuaid6 government, but also addresses the situation on the ground in Venezuela. Creditors ACL \nand Rusoro similarly rely on both the actions of the Maduro Regime and the Guaid6 \nGovernment. \nHaving considered the evidence and arguments , and for the reasons set out in this \nOpinion, the Court has decided to grant the motions. The moving parties have proven, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that PDVSA has been and is the alter ego of Venezuela , at all \npertinent times, including from August 2018 through at least October 13, 2022. The record \nbefore the Court establishes that the Guaid6 Government exercises direction and control over \nPDVSA in the United States while the Maduro Regime exercises direction and control over \nPDVSA inside Venezuela. Accordingly , the Court will grant the motions and confer with the \nparties as to the next steps it should take. \nThis Opinion proceeds as follows. First, the Court makes findings of fact based on the \nextensive record created by the parties, principall y at and in connection with the April 2021 \nhearing. These include findings about the relationship between the recognized Guaid6 \nGovernment and PDVSA in the U.S. and the relationship between the non-recognized Maduro \nRegime and PDVSA inside Venezuela. The bulk of these findings are entered only with respect \nto OIEG and Huntington, the creditors who participated in the April 2021 hearing and who \nexpressly agreed that evidence admitted in either of these actions would be part of the record in \nboth actions. After setting out the Court's findings, the Court applies alter-ego law and \nconcludes that the moving parties have proven that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela, both in \nthe U.S. and in Venezuela, at all pertinent times. The Court also separately addresses the \n3 motions of ACL and Rusoro, based on the records made in these creditors' respective actions. \nFinally, the Court addresses various legal arguments the Venezuela Parties make in opposition to \nthe Court's conclusions , determining that none has merit. \nI. The Evidentiary Record \n1. OIEG moved into evidence Exhibits 1-148 of the joint exhibit list submitted by \nOIEG (0IEG Action D.I. 87) and Huntington (Huntington Action D.I. 42). (See, e.g., \nHuntington Action D.I. 47 (\"April 2021 Tr.\") at 152-53) \n2. Without objection (see id. at 42-45), the Court admitted all of this evidence. (See \nApril 2021 Tr. 42-45, at 152-53) \n3. The Court recognizes that certain of the admitted evidence is hearsay and it has \nfactored that characteristic into the probative weight it has given such evidence. \n4. The record in the Huntington Action and the 0JEG Action are identical. \n5. The record in the ACL Action differs from the joint record created in the 0JEG \nand Huntington Actions and differs from that created in the Rusoro Action. \n6. The record in the Rusoro Action differs from the joint record created in the \nHuntington and 0JEG Actions and differs from that created in the ACL Action. Also, the Court \ndid not address the Rusoro Action in its March 2, 2022 opinion (seeOIEG Action D.I. 109) and \nthat opinion was not docketed in the Rusoro Action. Because many of the issues disputed by \nRusoro and the Venezuela Parties are materially identical (including the arguments made by both \nsides) to those addressed by the Court in its March 2, 2022 opinion -which considered the \n0IEG, Huntington, and ACL Actions -and because the Court's view on these common issues \nhas not changed, the Court hereby adopts and incorporates by reference its March 2, 2022 \nOpinion (i.e., 0IEG Action D.I. 109) and particularly its conclusions as to ripeness and the \nimpact of U.S. sanctions on these ongoing proceedings (see id. at 9-18). \n4 7. Unless otherwise noted, the Court's findings of fact pertain to all four creditors' \nactions. \n8. The Court makes additional findings of fact in the A CL Action in Discussion Parts \nIII & VI and makes additional findings of fact in the Rusoro Action in Discussion Parts IV & \nVII. \nII. Background \nA. Venezuela And Its State-Run Oil Company \n9. Venezuela is home to the \"largest proven oil reserves in the world.\" Jimenez v. \nPalacios, 250 A.3d 814, 822 (Del. Ch. 2019).3 \n10. \"[T]he Venezuelan constitution ... endows the [Republic] with significant control \nover PDVSA and the oil industry in the country.\" Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 147. \n11. PDVSA was formed as the state oil concern in 1975, pursuant to Venezuela 's \nNationalization Law. (OIEG Action D.I. 50 (February 19, 2021 Declaration of Christopher L. \nCarter) (\"Second Carter Deel.\") Exs. 4, 5, 11 ,r 12; ACL Action D.I. 4-7 (November 22, 2021 \nDeclaration of Keane A. Barger) (\"Barger Deel.\") Ex. 48 ,r,r 8-14; Rusoro Action D.I. 3 (Feb. 9, \n2022 Declaration of Charlene C. Sun) (\"Sun Deel.\") Exs. 8, 9, 10 ,r,r 8-14) \n12. PDVSA's incorporation in 1975 was as a sociedad an6nima intended to have its \nown legal personality distinct from its sole shareholder , the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela . \n(OIEG Action D.I. 66 (April 2, 2021 Declaration of Allan R. Brewer-Carias) (\"Brewer-Carias \nDeel.\") ,r,r 20-22; Barger Deel. Ex. 55 ,r 4; Sun Deel. Ex. 14 ,r 4) \n3 In Jimenez, Chancellor McCormack of the Delaware Court of Chancery determined that the Ad \nHoc Board of Directors of PDVSA (\"Ad Hoc Board\" or \"Ad Hoc PDVSA\") appointed by the \nGuaid6 government constituted the legitimate board, in the view of the United States, and, \ntherefore, our nation's courts. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 820. In this Opinion, the Court is taking \njudicial notice of facts found by the Chancellor; all of the facts for which Jimenez is cited are \nundisputed in the instant actions. \n5 13. Until approximately 2003, PDVSA operated as an independent economically-\ndriven company, without political interference from Venezuela. (Brewer-Carias Deel.~~ 3, 23; \nsee also Crystallex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 412 (discussing Declaration of Dr. Roberto Rigobon \nsubmitted by Crystallex )) \n14. \"PDVSA's Articles of Incorpora tion require that it adhere to policies established \nby the National Executive. \" Crystal/ex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 408. \n15. Pursuant to its bylaws, \"PDVSA plans, coordinates and controls the exploration , \nexploitation , transportation , manufacturing , refining, storage, commercialization , and other \nactivities of its subsidiaries regarding crude oil and other hydrocarbons both in the territory of \nthe Republic and abroad.\" (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 12 ~ 5; Barger Deel. Ex. 55 ~ 5; Sun Deel. \nEx.14~5) \n16. PDVSA is, thus, a state-owned and state-controlled commercial enterprise \ndirected to \"comply with and implement the policy on hydrocarbons enacted by the National \nExecutive Branch.\" (Second Carter Deel. Exs. 6, 7, 11 ~ 14; Barger Deel. Ex. 48 ~ 12; Sun Deel. \nExs. 11, 10 ~ 12) \n17. PDVSA owns 100% of the shares of PDV Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation , \nwhich in turn owns 100% of the shares of CITGO Holding, Inc., also a Delaware corporation. \nSee Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 822. \n18. CITGO Holding, Inc. owns 100% of the shares of CITGO Petroleum Corporation \n(\"CITGO Petroleum \"), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Texas. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d \nat 822. \n19. The PDVH shares, whether controlled by the board appointed by the Maduro \nRegime or the Ad Hoc Board appointed by the Guaid6 Government, are used for a commercial \n6 purpose because, through them, PDVSA manages its ownership of PDVH. See Crystallex I, 333 \nF. Supp. 3dat417-18. \nB. 01 European Group B.V.4 \n20. Judgment creditor 01 European Group B.V. is a Netherlands-incorporated \ncompany and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of 0-1 Glass, Inc., a Delaware corporation \nheadquartered in Perrysburg, Ohio. (OIEG Action D.I. 121 ,r 1) \n21. OIEG holds a judgment entered on an arbitral award against the Republic. The \nunderlying dispute between OIEG and Venezuela arises out of the expropriation, by the regime \nof former President Hugo Chavez, of the assets of OIEG' s Venezuelan subsidiaries, which \nmanufactured glass containers for food companies in Venezuela. (Id. D.I. 67 (April 2, 2021 \nDeclaration of Kevin A. Meehan) (\"Meehan Deel.\") Ex. 1 ,r,r 86-88, 108) Those assets were \ntransferred to Venezuela 's Ministry of Science, Technology and Intermediate Industries \n(\"Ministry of Science\"). (Meehan Deel. ,r,r 111-13) The expropriated assets were eventually \ntransferred to Venezolana del Vidrio, C.A., a company owned by the Ministry of Science. \n(Meehan Deel. ,r 90) \n22. After OIEG's assets were confiscated in 2010, OIEG commenced arbitration \nproceedings against Venezuela with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment \nDisputes (\"ICSID\") on September 7, 2011. (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 3 at 1) \n23. The ICSID tribunal issued an award (the \"OIEG Award\") on March 10, 2015, \nfinding that Venezuela expropriated OIEG's interests and was required to pay OIEG \n$372,461,982 for the expropriation and $5,750,000 in costs and expenses, plus interest. (Second \nCarter Deel. Ex. 3 at 1) \n4 The findings of fact in this subsection only apply in the OIEG Action. \n7 24. Venezuela sought annulment of the OIEG Award. On December 6, 2018, the \nICSID annulment panel reaffirmed the OIEG Award and awarded OIEG additional damages. \n(Second Carter Deel. Ex. 3 at 1) \n25. On May 21, 2019, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \n(the \"DC Court\") granted OIEG's motion for summary judgment , confirming the OIEG Award. \nThe DC Court entered judgment in favor of OIEG, consisting of: \na. $372,461,982 in principal amount, plus interest from October 26, 2010 \nthrough May 21, 2019, calculated at a LIBOR interest rate for one-year deposits in U.S. dollars, \nplus a margin of 4%, with annual compounding of accrued interest; \nb. $5,750,000 in costs and expenses relating to the original arbitration \nproceeding , plus interest from March 10, 2015 through May 21, 2019, calculated at a LIBOR \ninterest rate for one-year deposits in U.S. dollars, plus a margin of 4%, with annual compounding \nof accrued interest; \nc. $3,864,811.05 in costs and expenses relating to the annulment proceeding , \nplus interest from December 6, 2018 through May 21, 2019, calculated at a LIBOR interest rate \nfor one-year deposits in U.S. dollars, plus a margin of 4%, with annual compounding of accrued \ninterest; and \nd. Post-judgment interest on the total amount, calculated at the rate set forth \nin 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, from May 21, 2019 until full payment. (Second Carter Deel. Exs. 1, 2) \n26. On November 1, 2019, the DC Court granted OIEG's motion for relief pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1963 and 1610(c), authorizing OIEG to pursue formal enforcement remedies. \n(Second Carter Deel. Ex. 3) \n8 27. On November 4, 2019, OIEG registered its judgment with this Court pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963. (OIEG Action D.I. 1) \n28. On that same date, OIEG moved for a writ of attachment fieri facias against the \nshares of PDVH held by judgment debtor Venezuela 's purported alter ego, PDVSA. (Id. D.I. 2) \n29. The Court denied OIEG's motion, which was based on collateral estoppel, \nexplaining: \ncollateral estoppel does not apply, [ and] any creditor seeking to \nplace itself in a situation similar to Crystalle x will have to prove that \nPDVSA is and/or was the Republic 's alter ego on whatever pertinent \nand applicable date. In attempting to meet this burden, any creditor \nmay be able to find support (perhaps strong support) in the record \ncreated in the Crystalle x [Action] ... and the finding reached ( and \naffirmed) there. \nCrystal/ex Int'/ Corp. v. PDV Holding Inc., 2019 WL 6785504, at *8 (D. Del. Dec. 12, 2019). \n30. On January 15, 2021, the Court denied OIEG's motion for reconsideration. \n(OIEG Action D.I. 27, 43) On February 19, 2021, OIEG filed its renewed motion for a writ of \nattachment. (Id. D.I. 48) \n31. As this Court has already held (see O IEG Action D .I. 109 at 22 n.18), the DC \nCourt determined that , under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(c), a reasonable period oftime has elapsed \nfollowing the entry of judgment in favor of OIEG. (See also id. D.I. 4 (Nov. 4, 2019 Declaration \nof Christopher L. Carter) (\"First Carter Deel.\") Ex. 4 at 3-8; id. D.I. 49 at 22; Second Carter \nDeel. Ex. 3) \nC. Huntington5 \n32. Judgment creditor Huntington holds a judgment entered on an arbitration award \nagainst Venezuela 's Ministry of Defense, part of the Venezuelan state. (Huntington Action D.I. \n5 The findings of fact in this subsection only apply in the Huntington Action. \n9 27 (Feb. 19, 2021 Declaration of Alexander A. Yanos) (\"First Yanos Deel.\") Ex. 3 at 1, 7; see \nalso Northrop Grumman Ship Sys., Inc. v. Ministry of Def of the Bolivarian Republic of Venez., \n2003 WL 27383249, at *1 (S.D. Miss. April 16, 2003) (\"The Defendant Ministry of Defense of \nthe Republic of Venezuela (herein, \"The Ministry\") is a foreign state as defined by the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act.\")) \n33. Specifically, on February 19, 2018, an arbitral tribunal issued an award against \nthe Republic and in favor of Huntington in the net amount of $128,862,457.27, not including \npost-award interest. (First Yanos Deel. Ex. 3 at 7) \n34. The underlying dispute leading to the arbitration award arose out of the Ministry \nof Defense's breach of a 1997 contract for Huntington to repair two warships. See Northrop \nGrumman Ship Sys. v. Ministry of Def of the Republic ofVenez., 2020 WL 1584378, at *1 (S.D. \nMiss. Mar. 31, 2020). \n35. A federal district court in Mississippi confirmed the award and entered judgment \nfor Huntington on June 4, 2020. (Huntington Action D.I. 1 Ex. 1; see also April 2021 Tr. at 13) \nJudgment was entered against the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Venezuela for \n$137,977,646.43, which included pre-award interest and costs and fees. (See Huntington Action \nD.I. 1 Ex. 1 at 2) Post-award interest accrues pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 starting from the date \nof the Mississippi district court's opinion, which was March 31, 2020. (Id. D.I. 1 Ex. 1 at 2) \n36. Huntington registered the Mississippi district court's judgment in this District on \nJuly 31, 2020. (Id. D.I. 1) \n3 7. Huntington filed a motion for a writ of attachment on September 15, 2020 and an \namended motion for a writ of attachment on February 19, 2021. (Id. D.I. 3, 25) 38. The Court has already held that, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(c), a reasonable period \nof time has elapsed following the entry of judgment in favor of Huntington. (Id. D.I. 59 at 2) \nD. ACL6 \n39. ACLl Investments Ltd., ACL2 Investments Ltd., and LDO (Cayman) XVIII Ltd. \nare and at all relevant times have been beneficial owners of bonds issued by the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela. (Barger Deel. Ex. 37 at 12) \n40. The underlying dispute arose out of the Republic's default on certain bonds issued \nby the Republic. (ACL Action D.I. 50 (PDVSA Proposed Findings of Fact) ,r 9) \n41. PDVSA is not an obliger on the bonds and had no involvement in the Republic's \nissuance and default on the bonds. (Id. D.I. 50 ,r 9) \n42. On December 7, 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District \nofNew York entered judgment in favor of ACL and against Venezuela in an amount totaling \n$118,186,251.24. (ACL Action D.I. 3 at 10) \n43. ACL and the Republic stipulated that \"interest on a federal judgment would run at \nthe rate provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961.\" (ACLI Investments Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of \nVenez., No. 19-cv-09014 D.I. 51 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2020) (Stipulation) at 2, D.I. 51 at 12 (final \njudgment stating that parties are \"bound by the terms of' D .I. 51)) \n44. On February 5, 2021, ACL registered its judgment in this District pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1963. (ACL Action D.I. 1) \n45. ACL filed its attachment motion on November 22, 2021. (Id. D.I. 2) \n46. The Court has already held that, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(c), a reasonable period \noftime has elapsed following the entry of judgment in favor of ACL. (Id. D.I. 34 at 2) \n6 The findings of fact in this subsection only apply in the ACL Action. \n11 E. Rusoro7 \n47. Judgment creditor Rusoro is a Canadian gold mining company listed on the \nToronto Stock Exchange. See Rusoro Mining Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic ofVenez., 300 F. Supp. \n3d 137, 141-42 (D.D.C. 2018). \n48. Rusoro holds a judgment on an arbitral award against the Republic. The \nunderlying dispute arises out of the Chavez regime's expropriation of Rusoro's interests in \nmining concessions in Venezuela. (Rusoro Action D.I. 34 (PDVSA Proposed Findings of Fact) \n49. On July 17, 2012, Rusoro commenced arbitration proceedings against Venezuela \npursuant to the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules of the ICSID and the July 1, 1996 \nAgreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of \nVenezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments. (Sun Deel. ,i 3) \n50. On August 22, 2016, the arbitration tribunal issued a final award in favor of \nRusoro, finding that Venezuela had unlawfully expropriated Rusoro' s mining portfolio without \ncompensation and ordering Venezuela to pay Rusoro $966.5 million in damages, plus interest. \n(Sun Deel. ,i 4) \n51. On March 2, 2018, the DC Court recognized the arbitration award and entered \njudgment against Venezuela in the amount of $967,777,002.00, plus (i) interest as provided by \nthe arbitral tribunal; (ii) post-judgment interest, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, accruing through \nthe date of payment; and (iii) costs as provided by the arbitral tribunal, in the amount of \n$3,302,500.00. (Sun Deel. ,i 5; see also Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venez., \n16-cv-2020 (D.D.C. Mar. 2, 2018) D.I. 22) \n7 The findings of fact in this subsection only apply in the Rusoro Action. \n12 52. On November 4, 2021, Rusoro registered its judgment in this District pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963. (Rusoro Action D.I. 1) \n53. Rusoro filed its attachment motion on February 9, 2022. (Id D.I. 2) \n54. The Court has already held that, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(c), a reasonable period \nohime has elapsed following the entry of judgment in favor ofRusoro. (Id D.I.2012 ) \nIII. Findings Made In Crystallex I \n55. The Court previously found in Crystallex /that, as of August 9, 2018, PDVSA \nwas the alter ego of Venezuela. See 333 F. Supp. 3d at 406. The Court further found that, as of \nthat date, PDVSA's shares of PDVH were subject to attachment by Crystallex, a judgment \ncreditor of Venezuela. See id at 415. \n56. At the April 2021 hearing, Huntington , OIEG, and PDVSA recognized that the \nCourt's findings in Crystallex I are relevant to the analysis the Court is now undertaking with \nrespect to additional creditors. (See April 2021 Tr. at 12 (Huntington framing \"main question\" \nas \"whether the U.S. government's recognition of Juan Guaid6 ... means that PDVSA is no \nlonger Venezuela's alter ego\"), 27 (OIEG suggesting August 2018 findings are \"the starting \npoint\"), 229-31 (PDVSA suggesting similarly)) \n57. ACL, too, has argued that the Court's Crystal lex I factual findings are relevant to \nits case. (See ACL Action D.I. 3 at 3-5 (ACL \"summariz[ing] the facts central to Crystal/ex \" \nbecause of the general relevance of historical facts under Crystal/ex)) \n58. Rusoro has also focused on the Court's Crystal/ex /factual findings as they relate \nto its case. (See Rusoro Action D.I. 4 Ex. 1 at 9-12; id. D.I. 4 Ex. 1 at 12 (\"All of the factors that \ninformed the Crystal/ex I court's 2018 decision remain true today.\")) \n59. The Court's conclusions in Crystal/ex I were based on, among others, the \nfollowing specific findings of fact: \n13 a. \nSupp. 3d at 406; \nb. \nC. \nsee id. at 407-08; Venezuela used PDVSA's property as its own, see Crystallex I, 333 F. \nVenezuela ignored PDVSA's separate status, see id. at 406-07; \nVenezuela deprived PDVSA of independence from close political control, \nd. Venezuela required PDVSA to obtain government approvals for ordinary \nbusiness decisions, see id. at 408-09; and \ne. Venezuela issued policies causing PDVSA to act directly on behalf of \nVenezuela, see id. at 409-10. \n60. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed this Court's \nholding, approvingly citing these same factual findings. See Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 146-49. \nThe Third Circuit added: \"Indeed, if the relationship between Venezuela and PDVSA cannot \nsatisfy the Supreme Court's extensive-control requirement , we know nothing that can.\" Id. at \n152. \nIV. Venezuela: One Country With Two Governments \n61. In 2013, following the death of former President Hugo Chavez, Nicolas Maduro \nbecame Venezuela's president. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 821. \n62. In May 2017, when political opponents of Maduro gained control of Venezuela 's \nlegislative body (the National Assembly) , the Maduro Regime formed a new legislative body, \nthe National Constituent Assembly, granting itself the power to legislate and to put opposition \nleaders on trial. See id. \n63. In August 2018, when the Court ruled in Crystallex I, Maduro was both de jure \nand de facto President of Venezuela . \n14 64. Venezuela held a presidential election in 2018, during which Maduro disqualified \nhis opposition and claimed to win reelection. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 821. \n65. On January 10, 2019, after the disputed election, Maduro was sworn in for a \nsecond term as President of Venezuela. See id. \n66. On January 15, 2019, Venezuela 's National Assembly rejected Maduro's claim \nfor a second presidential term. See id. \n67. On January 23, 2019, the National Assembly named the opposition leader, Juan \nGuaid6, as \"Interim President \" of Venezuela. See id. \n68. Also on January 23, 2019, U.S. President Donald J. Trump issued a statement that \nprovided, in part, \"Today, I am officially recognizing the President of the Venezuelan National \nAssembly , Juan Guaid6, as the Interim President of Venezuela.\" (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 9; \nBarger Deel. Ex. 1; Sun Deel. Ex. 1; see also Brewer-Carias Deel. ,r 27 & n.19) \n69. The U.S. government , acting through its Executive Branch, has expressly declared \nits non-recognition of the Maduro Regime, stating: \"The United States does not recognize the \nMaduro regime as the government of Venezuela ,\" adding: \"the United States does not consider \nformer president Nicolas Maduro to have the legal authority \" to act on behalf of the Republic. \n' \n(Meehan Deel. Ex. 3) The U.S. has also \"refused to recognize Maduro as Venezuela 's head of \nstate.\" (Meehan Deel. Ex. 2 at 2) \n70. Despite the official recognition of the Guaid6 Government , and official non-\nrecognition of the Maduro Regime, the United States has acknowledged that the Maduro Regime \ncontinues to exercise de facto power over Venezuela , stating for example: \"We continue to hold \nthe illegitimate Maduro regime directly responsible for any threats it may pose to the safety of \n15 the Venezuelan people.\" (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 9; Barger Deel. Ex. 1; Sun Deel. Ex. 1; see \nalso April 2021 Tr. at 146) \n71. The United Nations recognized Venezuelan ambassadors appointed by the \nMaduro Regime before August 2018 and has continued to do so. (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 10 at \n6; Sun Deel. Ex. 2) \n72. The European Union, the Lima Group, and Canada recognized Mr. Guaid6 as \nVenezuela 's official representative in 2019, but ceased to do so in January or February 2021. \n(OIEG Action D.I. 51 (Feb. 19, 2021 Declaration of Barbara Miranda) (\"First Miranda Deel.\") \nEx. 1); Sun Deel. Ex. 4) \nV. The Guaido Government Controls PDVSA In The United States \n73. In March 2021, in criminal proceedings against Jose Luis de Jongh Atencio, a \nformer CITGO Petroleum Corporation (\"CITGO\") employee, the Executive Branch of the U.S. \ngovernment told the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas: \"PDVSA's U.S. \nsubsidiaries , including Citgo, are controlled by the ad hoc Administrative Board of PDVSA, \nappointed by President Guaid6.\" United States v. Jose Luis De Jongh Atencio, No. 20-cr-00305-\nS-1, D.I. 80 at 8 (U.S. Government Trial Brief) (S.D. Tex. Mar. 16, 2021). \n74. The Maduro Regime does not control any property of PDVSA in the United \nStates, including the PDVH shares. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 825-26; OIEG Action D.I. 68 \n(April 1, 2021 Declaration of Horacio Francisco Medina Herrera) (\"Medina Deel.\") 1 1 O; \nMedina Deel. Ex. A (June 17, 2020 Declaration of Luis A. Pacheco) (\"Pacheco Deel.\") 1111-\n12.8 \n8 PDVSA also filed the Medina and Pacheco Declarations in the ACL Action (D.I. 23-38 Exs. 1-\n2) but not in the Rusoro Action. Hence, the Court will sustain Rusoro's objection to reliance on \nthese Declarations in the Rusoro Action (see D.I. 36 at 1-2), although this ruling has no impact \non any substantive issue in dispute. \n16 75. The Maduro Regime has not appointed a single member of PDVSA's Ad Hoc \nBoard or any of the directors of PDVSA's U.S. subsidiaries. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 825-26. \n76. Neither the Maduro Regime nor anyone affiliated with the Maduro Regime has \naccess to any assets, funds, or information held by PDVSA in the U.S. or its U.S. subsidiaries. \n(Medina Deel. ,r,r 6, 1 O; Pacheco Deel. ,r 11 )9 \nVI. The Guaido Government's Direction And Control Over PDVSA In The U.S. Is \nAnalogous To The Direction And Control The Court Found Maduro Exercised In \nAugust 201810 \n77. As detailed below, the nature of the relationship between the Republic and \nPDVSA has not materially changed in the time after the Court made its findings of fact in \nCrystallex I in August 2018, notwithstanding the U.S. recognition of the Guaid6 Government in \nJanuary 2019.11 \nA. Level of economic control by the Guaido Government \n78. The Guaid6 Government maintains significant control over PDVSA in the U.S., \ndue in part to the Venezuelan constitution. See Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 147 (\"[T]he \n9 This finding of fact does not apply in the Rusoro Action. \n10 The findings of fact in this Part apply only in the OIEG and Huntington Actions. \n11 The Court organizes its findings based on the factors identified by the Supreme Court in its \nrecent decision in Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 138 U.S. 816, 823 (2018), which is the same \nformulation of the alter ego factors the Third Circuit applied in Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 141 n.8. \nThis Court in Crystal/ex I had, instead, applied the slightly different formulation the Supreme \nCourt had set out in First National City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba \n(\"Bancec\"), 462 U.S. 611, 624-27 (1983). Were the Court instead to apply the Bancec \narticulation of relevant considerations in this Opinion, the analysis would not materially change. \nMoreover, as will become evident, the factors the Court is using are not mutually exclusive but \nhave some overlap; thus, at least some of the findings of fact could reasonably be listed under \nany of multiple factors. The Court's specific placement of the facts has little, if any, impact on \nits overall conclusion. \n17 Venezuelan constitution ... endows the State with significant control over PDVSA and the oil \nindustry in the country. \"). \n79. \"Article 12 [of the Venezuela constitution] provides hydrocarbon deposits within \nthe territory of the state are the property of the Republic .\" Crysta/lex II, 932 F.3d at 147; see \nalso Sun Deel. Ex. 6 (Venezuela constitution 's Article 12 and its certified English translation). \n80. \"Article 302 reiterates 'the state reserves to itself, through the pertinent organic \nlaw, and for reasons of national convenience , petroleum activity.\"' Crysta/lex II, 932 F.3d at 147 \n( quoting Venezuelan constitution); see also Sun Deel. Ex. 6 (Venezuelan constitution 's article \n302 and its certified English translation). \n81. \"Article 303 addresses the state's control over PDVSA specifically : 'For reasons \nof economic and political sovereignty and national strategy, the State shall retain all shares in \nPetr6leos de Venezuela, S.A. \"' Crysta/lex II, 932 F .3d at 14 7 ( quoting Venezuelan constitution ); \nsee also Sun Deel. Ex. 6 (Venezuelan constitution 's article 303 and its certified English \ntranslation). \n82. The Guaid6 Government has continued to assert Venezuela 's economic control \nover PDVSA and PDVSA's assets (and subsidiaries ) in the U.S. For instance, Article 34 of the \nTransition Statute (more specifically identified below) provides: \"[T]he business of PDV \nHolding, Inc. and its subsidiaries shall follow commercial efficiency principles , subject only to \nthe control and accountability processes exercised by the National Assembly , and other \napplicable control mechanisms. \" (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 23 ,r 12; see also Tidewater v. \nBolivarian Republic ofVenez. , No. 19-mc-0079 (D. Del. June 1, 2020) D.I. 15 (Declaration of \nJose Ignacio Hernandez)) \n18 83. To fund itself, the Guaido Government has drawn directly from PDVSA \ncommercial subsidiaries in the United States, bypassing PDVSA's corporate right to dividends . \n(First Miranda Deel. Exs. 37, 38 at 4 (\"[T]he Trump administration gave the Venezuelan \nopposition access to U.S. bank accounts containing billions belonging to the state-owned oil \ncompany , PDVSA\"); Huntington Action D.I. 48 (May 5, 2021 Declaration of Alexander A. \nYanos) (\"Fifth Yanos Deel.\") Ex. 124 at 3; April 2021 Tr. at 22, 161) \n84. In April 2020, the Guaido Government tapped PDVSA and CITGO funds located \nin the United States to fund its legal fees and also to fund the National Assembly itself. (Fifth \nYanos Deel. Ex. 3; Huntington Action D.I. 28 (February 19, 2021 Expert Report of Manuel A. \nGomez) (\"Gomez Report\") ,r 22 (\"PDVSA funds have also been directed to be used in the legal \ndefense of Venezuela in foreign and international proceedings. \")) 12 \n85. The Guaido Government has treated the liabilities of Venezuela and PDVSA as \none, specifically indicating that it intends to treat PDVSA's bond debt interchangeably with \nVenezuela's bond debt in an eventual restructuring , just as President Maduro had previousl y \ndeclared. Compare Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 147-48 (noting that in 2017 President Maduro \ndecreed that \"Venezuela would restructure the external debt of both Venezuela and PDVSA\"), \nwith Second Carter Deel. Ex. 8 at 2 (Mr. Guaido promising \"no different treatment shall be \naccorded to eligible ... claims as a result of ... the identity of the public sector obligor (the \nRepublic, PDVSA or another public sector entity\")). \n12 PDVSA cites to the Gomez Report in all four actions before the Court, although it was never \nfiled in the ACL Action. ACL does not appear to object to its consideration in connection with \nits motion. As the Court only relies on the Gomez Report as support for the creditors, the Court \ndeems it appropriate to consider this document even in connection with the ACL Action. That \nsaid, were the Court not to consider the Gomez Report, no finding or conclusion would differ. \n19 86. In late 2019, the National Assembly (which supports Mr. Guaid6) declared \nPDVSA bonds to be void and illegally issued. See Petr6leos de Venez. SA. v. MUFG Union \nBank, NA., 495 F. Supp. 3d 257, 266-67 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). \n87. On October 1, 2019, the National Assembly executed the \"Agreement that \nAuthorized the Use of Resources of Petr6leos De Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) to Defend Its Assets \nAbroad\" (\"Agreement on PDVSA Resources \"). (Huntington Action D.I. 45 (April 29, 2021 \nDeclaration of Alexander A. Yanos) (\"Fourth Yanos Deel.\") Ex. 14; see also April 2021 Tr. at \n89) The Agreement on PDVSA Resources does not separate PDVSA's legal decisions from the \nRepublic's control. \n88. The Agreement on PDVSA Resources requires PDVSA to obtain prior \nauthorization for certain transactions from the Permanent Finance and Economic Development \nCommission of the National Assembly, which in turn required regular updates from the \nVenezuelan Special Attorney's Office. (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 14 at 3-4; April 2021 Tr. at 89) \n89. Reflecting its understanding that the Republic should exercise economic control \nover PDVSA's transactions , the Guaid6 Government objected to the Maduro Regime's sale of \nPDVSA's stake in a Swedish refinery, Nynas AB, by noting that the National Assembly 's energy \ncommittee considered the deal null \"as it was not approved by congress. \" (First Miranda Deel. \nEx. 25 at 1; see also Fifth Yanos Deel. Ex. 1) \n90. On November 19, 2019, the National Assembly executed an \"Agreement that \nAuthorized the Creation of the Special Litigation Fund\" (\"Litigation Fund Agreement\") , which \nestablished a \"Special Litigation Fund\" consisting of resources found in bank accounts abroad in \nfavor of, among others, the State (i.e., the Republic of Venezuela) , the Central Bank of \nVenezuela , and PDVSA. (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 16) \n20 91. Pursuant to the express terms of the Litigation Fund Agreement , the Republic \nconsiders PDVSA and its assets as \"Venezuelan assets held abroad\" and effectively requires \nPDVSA to seek approval from the Republic to spend its own resources . (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. \n16) \n92. All of the funds established by the Litigation Fund Agreement are to be overseen \nby a \"technical commission \" appointed by the National Assembly . (Id) \nB. Whether PDVSA's profits go to the Guaido Government \n93. \"As PDVSA's lone shareholder , all profit ultimately runs to the Venezuelan \ngovernment.\" Crystallex 11, 932 F.3d at 148. \n94. PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board's Twitter feed refers to PDVSA's assets as assets of \nVenezuela. (First Miranda Deel. Exs. 29, 30, 31; see also OIEG Action D.I. 90 (April 29, 2021 \nSupplemental Declaration of Barbara Miranda) (\"Fourth Miranda Deel.\") Exs. 12, 13, 14 \n(\"[CITGO 's] value and potential is incalculable , we must recover it and put it at the service of \nVenezuelans.\")) \nC. Degree to which the Guaido Government manages PDVSA or has a hand in \nPDVSA's daily affairs \n95. On February 5, 2019, the National Assembly approved and adopted a Statute to \nGovern a Transition to Democracy to Reestablish the Validity of the Constitution of the Republic \nof Venezuela (the \"Transition Statute\"). Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 824. The Transition Statute \n\"specifically empowered Guaid6 to 'appoint an ad hoc Managing Board' of PDVSA 'to exercise \nPDVSA's rights as a shareholder of PDV Holding.\"' Id at 825. \n96. Article 34 of the Transition Statue bypasses PDVSA's ordinary corporate \ngovernance by empowering Mr. Guaid6 to appoint and remove an Ad Hoc Board of Directors to \nexercise rights as PDV Holding's shareholder , including appointing and removing board \n21 members to PDV Holding, CITGO, and other affiliates. (See April 2021 Tr. at 82 (Ad Hoc \nBoard head, Medina, acknowledging that Mr. Guaido may remove him from his position); OIEG \nAction D.I. 18 (Nov. 18, 2019 Declaration of Joseph E. Neuhaus) Ex. A; see also Gomez Report \n,r,r 18, 21) \n97. Since February 2019, PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board, appointed by the Guaido \nGovernment, has exercised PDVSA's shareholder rights to appoint PDVH's directors; PDVH's \ndirectors have, in turn, exercised PDVH's shareholder rights to appoint CITGO Holding's \ndirectors; and CITGO Holding's directors have, in turn, exercised CITGO Holding's shareholder \nrights to appoint CITGO Petroleum 's directors. (Medina Deel. ,r 4(d); Brewer-Carias Deel. Ex. \nB ,r 16; Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 825-26) \n98. PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board acknowledges that it operates at the \"directives\" of the \nGuaido Government. (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 21 (\"Protecting the CITGO assets is of \nparamount importance on the road to recovery of the Venezuela and its oil industry and is one of \nthe primary directives given by interim President Juan Guaido to the PDVSA ad hoc Board.\")) \n99. Under the Transition Statute, the National Assembly approves contracts, \ncoordinates and approves the funding of PDVSA's legal strategies, and approves PDVSA's \nappointment of affiliate directors. (Huntington Action D.I. 38 (April 16, 2021 Declaration of \nAlexander A. Yanos) (\"Second Yanos Deel.\") Ex. 2 at 15; Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 12 at 3 \n(requiring National Assembly 's \"prior approval\" of appointments for Ad Hoc Board and for \"the \ndirectors of its affiliate\")) \n100. Venezuela 's legal framework requires that every PDVSA contract with a foreign \nnational must be approved by the legislature consistent with Article 36 of the Transition Statute. \n(Gomez Report ,r 22) \n22 101. Mr. Medina, then chairman of PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board, acknowledged that \nPDVSA always fulfills its obligation to permit the National Assembly to review and approve any \ncontract signed by PDVSA with a foreign party. (See April 2021 Tr. at 85-86) \n102. On April 9, 2019, the National Assembly enacted the \"Accord to Expand the \nPowers Vested and the Number of Ad-Hoc Board Members of PDVSA\" (\"Accord\") that further \nexpanded Mr. Guaid6's control over PDVSA by authorizing him to act by special decree and by \nsuspending all rights and authorities otherwise vested in the Ad Hoc Board, the shareholders ' \nmeeting, and the Presidency of PDVSA and its affiliates. (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 12; Gomez \nReport ,r 20) \n103. The Accord also suspended any functions given to the Minister of Hydrocarbons \nand any other government official, branch or agency related to PDVSA, which had existed by or \nwas given any functions after January 10, 2019, replacing the previous legal framework for \nPDVSA's governance with \"total control\" of PDVSA by the Guaid6 Government. (First Yanos \nDeel. Ex. 17) \n104. The Accord also affirmed that PDVSA's legal strategy will be executed only in \ncoordination with the Special Attorney appointed by Mr. Guaid6. (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 12 at \n4) (\"[PDVSA] , in coordination with the Special Attorney appointed by the President of the \nRepublic, will carry out the legal representation of [Ad Hoc PDVSA] and its affiliate companies \nabroad.\") \n105. Ad Hoc PDVSA's management , as appointed by Mr. Guaid6, is subservient to the \nState. Louis Pacheco, then-Chairman of PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board, stated in a 2020 interview \nthat the Ad Hoc Board works toward \"the main objective\" of establishing the Guaid6 \nGovernment 's effective control over Venezuela . (Second Yanos Deel. Ex. 4 at 7) \n23 106. The corporate enterprise PDVSA -its actual revenue-generating assets, \nemployees, facilities, and contracts -remains as firmly controlled by the State as it ever was. \n(Gomez Report~ 22) \n107. Venezuela has admitted that the Guaid6 Government has the right to review \n\"national interest\" contracts, that is, those contracts entered into by PDVSA that implicate the \nnational public interest. (Huntington Action D.I. 74 ~ 10) In litigation seeking to invalidate the \n2020 CITGO bonds, the Ad Hoc Board argued that \"any\" PDVSA contract is \"a public interest \ncontract\" subject to National Assembly approval. (See Petr6leos De Venez. S.A. v. MUFG \nUnion Bank, NA., No. 1: 19-cv-10023 (S.D.N. Y. June 15, 2020) D.I. 117 (PDVSA Memorandum \nof Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment) at 30 n.84; April 2021 Tr. at 18, 101-103); \nsee also Petr6leos de Venez. S.A. v. MUFG Union Bank, NA., 495 F. Supp. 3d 257, 266-68 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020) (Guaid6 Government contending that every PDVSA contract with any foreign \nnational, including presumably every oil sale to foreign national, must be approved by \nlegislature)) \n108. PDVSA's litigation and negotiation strategy over the bonds, which is based on \nleveraging CITGO, were formulated at the direction of the Republic. (Second Yanos Deel. Ex. 4 \nat 6) (Pacheco stated in interview that Ad Hoc Board \"follow[ ed] the decisions that the National \nAssembly ... made\") \n109. Ad Hoc PDVSA's argument in the bond litigation, as crafted by the State, was \nthat the bonds leveraging CITGO were invalid ab initio because they were never approved by the \nNational Assembly in the first place. (First Yanos Deel. Ex. 16 at 29-30; April 2021 Tr. at 101-\n03) \n24 110. Venezuela and Ad Hoc PDVSA have used the same lawyers. For example, Ad \nHoc PDVSA's counsel in the Huntington Action represented Venezuela in two proceedings \nbefore the DC Court. See, e.g., Koch Minerals Sari v. Bolivarian Republic of Venez., No. l :17-\ncv-02559-ZMF (D.D.C. April 5, 2021) D.I. 53 at 4. \n111. Ad Hoc PDVSA only paid its debts in May 2019 after the Guaid6 Government \nauthorized such payments. (Fourth Yanos Ex. 12 at 2 (\"The ad hoc administrative board of \nPetr6leos de Venezuela , S.A. (PDVSA) announced today that National Assembly of the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela has authorized the interest payment on the PDVSA 2020 \nbond, an estimated amount of US 71.6 millions.\"); April 2021 Tr. at 17-18) \n112. In October 2019, Ad Hoc PDVSA stopped paying its debts, on instructions from \nthe National Assembly. (Second Yanos Deel. Ex. 2 at 12, Second Yanos Deel. Ex. 4 at 3-4; \nApril 2021 Tr. at 18) \nD. Whether the Guaid6 Government is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct \n113. The National Assembly website frequently provides updates on the status of Ad \nHoc PDVSA and its subsidiary, CITGO, repeatedl y referring to both as assets of the Venezuelan \nState. (First Yanos Deel. Exs. 12, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22) \n114. The National Assembly has stated that the Guaid6 Government \"shall continue to \ndevise strategies and legal and diplomatic measures to continue to protect CITGO and all the \nRepublic's assets, which have a vital role to play in the reconstruction once the usurpation of \npower in Venezuela has been brought to an end.\" (Fourth Yanos Deel. Ex. 18 at 2) \n115. Mr. Guaid6 and his government regularly characterize PDVSA and its related \nassets, such as CITGO, as assets of the State. (See, e.g., First Yanos Deel. Ex. 14 at 4) (Mr. \n25 Guaid6 characterizing appointment of Ad Hoc Board as part of \"taking progressive and orderly \ncontrol of the assets of our Republic abroad\" in order to \"speed up the political transition. \") \n116. PDVSA describes itself as having a \"constitutionally prescribed role\" in \nVenezuela to \"manage the oil industry,\" including CITGO -the '\"crown jewel' and most \neconomically and strategically important foreign asset of national public interest.\" (First Yanos \nDeel. Ex. 16 at 30 n.84, 31 (\"There is no dispute that PDVSA and PDVSA Petr6leo, which are \n'attached' to (and thus controlled by) Venezuela 's Ministry of Petroleum and Mining, are part of \nthe National Public Administration of the Venezuelan Republic.\") ; First Yanos Deel. Ex. 21 \n(Venezuelan Ambassador Carlos Vecchio stating, \"It is clear that we have done and will \ncontinue to do EVERYTHING to protect and preserve Citgo for Venezuelans. \"); First Yanos \nDeel. Ex. 22 (Mr. Guaid6 referring to protection of CITGO as protection of\"the country's \nassets\"); April 2021 Tr. at 109 (Mr. Medina testifying : \"That colloquial phrase of the crown \njewels, what it tries to say is to emphasize the importance that that asset has to Venezuela , to the \ncountry and, of course, to PDVSA, who is going to administer everything that has to do with the \nreactivation of the industry.\")) \n117. PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board's website states on its \"Our Mission\" page: \"Take back \nPDVSA abroad assets to ... achieve social welfare and progress for all Venezuelans. \" \nhttps://pdvsa-adhoc.com/en/our-mission/ (last visited February 17, 2021). \n118. The Ad Hoc Board's Twitter feed regularly tweets messages in support of the \nGuaid6 Government and refers to PDVSA's assets as assets of Venezuela. (First Miranda Deel. \nExs. 29, 30, 31; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 12 (\"The ad hoc PDVSA Board continues to work \nactively to recover Venezuela's assets abroad .... \"), Ex. 13 (\"The new CITGO Board of \nDirectors cooperates with North American courts to safeguard the assets of Venezuela and \n26 determine responsibility.\") , Ex. 14 (\"[CITGO's] value and potential is incalculable , we must \nrecover it and put it at the service of Venezuelans. \")) \n119. PetroCaribe is \"an agreement pursuant to which Venezuela committed PDVSA to \nsupply oil to 17 Caribbean countries on favorable economic terms .... \" Crysta/lex I, 333 F. \nSupp. 3d at 413; see also Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 147. \nE. Whether adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits \nin United States courts while avoiding its obligations \n120. Adhering to the nominally separate identity between the Republic of Venezuela \nand PDVSA to allow PDVSA to have its assets in the District of Delaware be immune from \nattachment to satisfy the lawful judgments of the U.S. courts against its alter ego, Venezuela , \nwould entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. courts while at the same time avoiding its \nobligations. \n121. The Third Circuit's statements in Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 149 (internal citations \nomitted), are equally applicable here: \nVenezuela owes [ the judgment creditors] from ... judgment[ s] that \nha[ ve] been affirmed in our courts. Any outcome where [ a creditor \nbefore the Court] is not paid means that Venezuela has avoided its \nobligations. It is likewise clear from the record that PDVSA, and \nby extension Venezuela , derives significant benefits from the U.S. \njudicial system. Its 2020 bonds are backed by the common stock \nand underlying assets of U.S.-based corporations , and hence \ndisputes stemming from default will be subject to U.S. laws and \npresumably be resolved through the U.S. legal system. Indeed, it \nis probable the U.S. legal system is the backstop that gives \nsubstantial assurance to investors who buy PDVSA's debt. \nVII. Maduro's Non-Recognized Government Continues To Control PDVSA In \nVenezuela \n122. While there has been U.S. recognition of corporate reorganizations at PDVSA's \nU.S. subsidiaries (done at the direction of Mr. Guaid6), these actions have had no effect on \n27 PDVSA itself. The state, through its political actors, continues to dominate and control PDVSA. \n(See April 2021 Tr. at 118, 122-23) \n123. Despite its non-recognition by the U.S. government , the Maduro Regime \ncontinues to exercise de facto control over Venezuela and its territory, including over PDVSA \nand its assets and operations in Venezuela . (See Second Carter Deel. Ex. 3 at 5; Brewer-Carias \nDeel., 44) \n124. While recognizing Guaid6 as Venezuela 's representative , the United States \nincludes the \"Maduro regime\" in its definition of the \"Government of Venezuela. \" (Second \nCarter Deel. Ex. 22 (Executive Order 13884)) \n125. On January 18, 2021, OFAC stated that the \"illegitimate Maduro regime has \ncontinued to use [PDVSA] as its primary conduit for corruption to exploit and profit from \nVenezuela 's natural resources. \" (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 18 at 1) \n126. In March 2021, the United States Executive Branch advised U.S. courts that \n\"President Maduro remains in power in Venezuela , and in control of PDVSA. \" (OIEG Action \nD.I. 78 (April 16, 2021 Supplemental Declaration of Barbara Miranda) (\"Second Miranda \nDeel.\") Ex. 1 at 8) \n127. The Ad Hoc Board of PDVSA, appointed by Guaid6 and recognized by U.S. \ncourts, is not identified on the PDVSA website, which instead publishes the names of other \nindividuals as its board members. (See First Miranda Deel. Ex. 2) \n128. Members of the Ad Hoc Board of PDVSA are subject to a Venezuelan criminal \nprosecution launched in 2019 under the auspices of the Republic 's Supreme Tribunal of Justice. \n(First Miranda Deel. Exs. 3, 4) \n28 129. PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board acknowledges that the corporation 's operations have not \nchanged. (See, e.g., Second Miranda Deel. Ex. 3; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 20 (letter from \nPDVSA Ad Hoc Board stating that \"PDVSA's Caracas office ... remains under the control of \nPDVSA's unlawful, usurping authorities of the illegitimate Maduro regime\")) \n130. CITGO Petroleum acknowledges that the Maduro Regime exercises \"control of \nPDVSA in Venezuela .\" (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 5 (CITGO Petroleum news release regarding \nMaduro Regime's seizure of vessel containing CITGO Petroleum 's crude oil, stating that \"The \nMaduro regime, including through its control of PDVSA in Venezuela , has previously attempted \nto obtain the cargo from the vessel\")) \n131. In July 2019, it was reported that PDVSA, under the direction of the Maduro \nRegime, was selling oil to a Turkish company known as Grupo lveex Insaat. (First Miranda \nDeel. Ex. 8) \n132. In March 2019, PDVSA, acting entirely through Maduro Regime officers, \nannounced the opening of an office in Moscow. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 6) \n133. In September 2019, a Maduro-appointed oil minister completed the move of \nPDVSA's Lisbon office to Moscow. (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 13) \n134. Maduro-appointed officers then set up a factoring arrangement between PDVSA \nand Rosneft (a Russian oil company headquartered in Moscow). (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 7) \n135. In November 2019, PDVSA signed a commercial contract with an Indian concern \n-with Maduro Regime officers providing the signatures. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 9) \n136. In May 2020, PDVSA, acting through its European subsidiary PDVSA Europa, \nsold a significant and valuable stake in Nynas, a Swedish oil refinery. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. \n25) After the fact, the Ad Hoc Board criticized the sale as \"harm[ful] to the nation's wealth,\" \n29 adding that the Ad Hoc Board \"was not informed of the company 's sale of a 3 5% stake in \nSwedish refiner Nynas.\" (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 26; Fifth Yanos Deel. Ex. 1) \n137. In March 2021, when a pipeline explosion damaged a PDVSA facility in \nVenezuela, the Ad Hoc Board blamed the incident on the Maduro Regime's incompetent \n\"manage[ment] of assets and facilities that belong to the Republic and the Venezuelan people,\" \nrevealing the Ad Hoc Board's understanding that PDVSA, owned by Venezuela , is dominated by \nthe Maduro Regime that currently controls the state. (Second Miranda Deel. Ex. 3; Fourth \nMiranda Deel. Ex. 20) \nVIII. The Maduro Regime's Direction And Control Over PDVSA In Venezuela Is \nAnalogous To The Direction And Control The Court Found In August 2018 \nA. Level of economic control by the Maduro Regime \n138. In May 2020, Maduro announced on national television that PDVSA would \nincrease consumer prices. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 23; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 10) A \nsubsequent press release published on PDVSA's website advised that the price of gasoline would \nincrease pursuant to the announcement. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 10; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. \n1) \n139. In approximately May 2020, acting pursuant Mr. Maduro's Executive Order \n4.090, PDVSA announced to owners oflicensed service stations in Venezuela that PDVSA was \nauthorized to rescind such licenses. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 18; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 5) \n140. On June 27, 2020, as directed by Maduro Regime appointees as corporate \nofficers, PDVSA rescinded agreements with various Venezuelans who licensed service stations, \nseizing them for the State. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 18; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 5) \n30 B. Whether PDVSA's profits go to the Maduro Regime \n141. The Maduro Regime profits from PDVSA's operations , as the Republic is the sole \nshareholder of PDVSA. See Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 148. \nC. Degree to which the Maduro Regime manages PDVSA or otherwise bas a \nhand in PDVSA's daily affairs \n142. As it had in and before 2018, PDVSA regularly tweets that \"PDVSA is \nVenezuela. \" Crysta/lex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 407. More recently, the message continues with \n\"In PDVSA we think as a Nation\" or \"as a Country.\" (First Miranda Deel. Exs. 44, 45) \n143. In late 2018, Maduro named General Manuel Salvador Quevedo Fernandez, a \ncareer military officer and then-Minister of Oil, as president of the board of PDVSA, and Tareck \nEl Aissami, the then-Minister of Industry and National Production , as External Director of \nPDVSA. See Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 822 n.7; First Yanos Deel. Ex. 6 (article showing Mr. \nQuevedo as both minister and president of PDVSA); First Yanos Deel. Ex. 7 (\"Venezuela names \nEl Aissami to PDVSA board of directors\")) \n144. Also in 2018, Mr. Quevedo imposed a military regime on PDVSA, arresting \nworkers for operational mistakes and deploying active military personnel aboard tankers. (First \nYanos Deel. Ex. 5 (\"Oil output goes AWOL in Venezuela as soldiers run PDVSA\")) \n145. On February 19, 2020, it was reported that Maduro ordered PDVSA employees to \nattack Interim President Guaid6. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 39; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 18 \n(\"Nicolas Maduro lashed out against Juan Guaid6, interim president of Venezuela, and called \nupon PDVSA workers to attack him and call him a traitor to the nation due to the recent United \nStates sanctions on Rosneft Trading.\")) \n146. On April 27, 2020, Maduro installed Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of the deceased \nformer President Chavez, as president of PDVSA. (First Miranda Deel. Exs. 12, 13; Fourth \n31 Miranda Deel. Ex. 3, 4) Maduro had previousl y appointed Asdrubal Chavez as president of \nCITGO. (Second Miranda Deel. Ex. 13; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 4) \n147. Also on April 27, 2020, Maduro appointed Tareck El Aissami, a long-time \nlieutenant and former close ally of Hugo Chavez, as Minister of Petroleum , and directed him to \nrestructure PDVSA. (First Miranda Deel. Exs. 12, 14; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 3) \n148. Mr. Maduro makes announcements in PDVSA's offices, and PDVSA's own press \nreleases issue the Maduro regime's policy. (See First Miranda Deel. Ex. 14) \n149. In February 2020, CITGO Petroleum released a statement that the Maduro \nRegime utilized \"its control of PDVSA in Venezuela \" and Venezuela 's military to take \npossession of CITGO's crude oil that was meant for delivery overseas. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. \n5) \n150. On May 27, 2020, El Aissami attended virtual OPEC meetings on behalf of \nVenezuela and PDVSA, and posted a photo of the event to his official Twitter account. (First \nMiranda Deel. Ex. 20; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 7) \nD. Whether the Maduro Regime is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct \n151. The version of PDVSA's website controlled by the Maduro Regime lists three \n\"Strategic Objectives ,\" one of which is to \"[s]upport the geopolitical positioning of Venezuela \ninternationally. \" Strategic Objectives, PDVSA, \nhttp://www.pdvsa.com/index.php ?option=com _ content& view=article&id =65 51 &Itemid=890&la \nng=en (last accessed Feb. 3, 2021). \n152. In furtherance of this strategy, Venezuela causes PDVSA to use its property and \nrevenues for the benefit of the State. \n32 153. For example, in March 2019, Venezuela 's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jorge \nArreaza, traveled abroad on board a PDVSA plane. (See First Miranda Deel. Ex. 27; Fourth \nMiranda Deel. Ex. 11) \n154. In 2019, Mr. Maduro sent an aircraft registered to PDVSA to Guinea-Bissau. \n(First Miranda Deel. Ex. 32; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 15) \n155. In November 2019, Maduro pledged Venezuelan state funds to pay PDVSA's \ndirect contract obligations for the completion of construction of PDVSA tankers. (Second Carter \nDeel. Ex. 16) \n156. On January 21, 2020, OFAC stated that \"[PDVSA] Falcon 200EX (YV3360 ) ... \nwas used throughout 2019 to transport senior members of the former Maduro regime in a \ncontinuation of the former Maduro regime's misappropriation of PdVSA assets.\" (Second Carter \nDeel. Ex. 17 at 1) \n157. In early 2020, in identifying numerous PDVSA aircraft as blocked property, \nOFAC stated that \"[i]n late Summer 2019, Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Salvador Quevedo \nFernandez ... attended an OPEC meeting in the United Arab Emirates and utilized the PdVSA \naircraft Falcon 200EX (YV3360). \" (Second Carter Deel. Ex. 17 at 1) \n158. In 2020, Venezuelan officials (appointed by Maduro) traveled to Trinidad & \nTobago aboard a PDVSA aircraft. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 28) \n159. On March 3, 2020, it was reported that Venezuela (via Maduro) was gifting \n\"PDVSA\" petroleum to Cuba. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 35; Third Miranda Deel. Ex. 16) \n160. In July 2020, it was reported that PDVSA gasoline was being loaded onto oil \ntankers destined for Cuba. (First Miranda Deel. Ex. 36; Fourth Miranda Deel. Ex. 17) \n33 161. Since December 11, 2020, PDVSA's official Twitter account has retweeted at \nleast 460 of Mr. Maduro's tweets. (First Miranda Deel.~ 4) \n162. PDVSA's official Twitter account regularly retweets the Ministry of Petroleum's \ntweets about the government's fuel distribution schedule, implemented through PDVSA \nlocations. (See, e.g., First Miranda Deel. Ex. 43) \nE. Whether adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits \nin United States courts while avoiding its obligations \n163. Adhering to the nominally separate identity between the Republic of Venezuela \nand PDVSA to allow PDVSA to have its assets in the District of Delaware be immune from \nattachment to satisfy the lawful judgments of the U.S. courts against its alter ego, Venezuela , \nwould entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. courts while at the same time avoiding its \nobligations. \n164. The Third Circuit's statements in Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 149, are equally \napplicable here: \nVenezuela owes [ the judgment creditors] from ... judgment[ s] that \nha[ ve] been affirmed in our courts. Any outcome where [ a creditor \nbefore the Court] is not paid means that Venezuela has avoided its \nobligations. It is likewise clear from the record that PDVSA, and \nby extension Venezuela, derives significant benefits from the U.S. \njudicial system. Its 2020 bonds are backed by the common stock \nand underlying assets ofU.S.-based corporations , and hence \ndisputes stemming from default will be subject to U.S. laws and \npresumably be resolved through the U.S. legal system. Indeed, it \nis probable the U.S. legal system is the backstop that gives \nsubstantial assurance to investors who buy PDVSA's debt. \nIX. PDVSA Continues To Use Its PDVH Shares For A Commercial Activity \n165. As part of their effort to show that the particular property at issue in their motions \nis not immune from attachment under the FSIA, the judgment creditors involved in the actions \nbeing addressed in this Opinion have shown that PDVSA uses its shares of PDVH stock for a \n34 commercial activity in the United States. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a)(6).13 In Crysta/lex I, 333 F. \nSupp. 3d at 417-18, this Court held that the PDVH shares are \"used for a commercial purpose\" \nbecause \"PDVSA manages its ownership of PDVH and, consequently, CITGO, in the United \nStates.\" \"Specifically, Venezuela- through PDVSA -uses the shares to appoint directors, \napprove contracts, and pledge assets as security for PDVSA's debt.\" Id. at 418. \n166. All of the commercial activities for which PDVSA's shares of PDVH had been \nused in the past, combined with the continued use of these shares for the same activities, render \nthose shares not immune from attachment. See Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 151 (\"[T]he shares can \nstill be used by PDVSA to run its business as an owner, to appoint directors, approve contracts , \nand to pledge PDVH's debts for its own short-term debt.\"). \n167. In February 2019, Mr. Guaid6 \"appointed an ad hoc administrative board to \nrepresent PDVSA in its capacity as sole shareholder of PDVH for appointing a new board of \ndirectors of that entity.\" Crystallex 11, 932 F.3d at 151. Since February 2019, PDVSA's Ad Hoc \nBoard has exercised PDVSA's shareholder rights to appoint PDVH's directors; PDVH's \ndirectors have, in turn, exercised PDVH's shareholder rights to appoint CITGO Holding's \ndirectors; and CITGO Holding's directors have, in turn, exercised CITGO Holding's shareholder \n13 As the Third Circuit explained in Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 150: \n[T]he phrase commercial activity captures the distinction \nbetween state sovereign acts, on the one hand, and state \ncommercial and private acts, on the other. [W]hen a foreign \ngovernment acts, not as a regulator of a market, but in the manner \nof a private player within it, the foreign sovereign's actions are \ncommercial within the meaning of the [FSIA]. \n(Internal citations and quotation marks omitted) To determine whether property to be attached \nhas been used for a \"commercial activity\" within the meaning of the FSIA, the Court applies a \ntotality of the circumstances test, which includes \"an examination of the uses of the property in \nthe past.\" Id. \n35 rights to appoint CITGO Petroleum 's directors. (Medina Deel.~ 4(d); Brewer-Carias Deel. Ex. \nB ~ 16; see also Jimenez, 250 A.3d at 825-26) \n168. Mr. Guaid6 appointed additional directors to both PDVSA's and CITGO's board \nin summer 2020. (First Yanos Deel. Exs. 18, 24) \n169. In the 2020 Bond proceedings , Mr. Guaid6's Ad Hoc Board confirmed that it \ncontinues to manage subsidiaries through PDVH. (First Yanos Deel. Ex. 16 at 31) ( discussing \n\"pledge of CITGO Shares to secure the 2020 Notes\") \nX. All Parties Agree There Has Been No Material Factual Change Since April 2021 \n170. On October 13, 2022, PDVSA made a binding representation that, since April \n2021, \"there has [not] been any material change to any fact relevant to the factual \ndetermination(s) the Court must make\" in connection with the alter ego controversy. (E.g., ACL \nAction D.I. 46 at 4) \n171. Also on October 13, 2022, all of the judgment creditors whose motions are \naddressed in this Opinion -OIEG, Huntington , ACL, and Rusoro -made the same \nrepresentation. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 119 at 2-5) \n172. It follows that the Court's findings and conclusions -that the Guaid6 Government \ndirects and controls PDVSA and its assets in the United States in a manner materially identical to \nthat which the Court found to exist in August 2018, and that the Maduro Regime directs and \ncontrols PDVSA and its assets inside Venezuela in a manner materially identical to that which \nthe Court found to exist in August 2018 -are equally true and applicable on all pertinent dates, \nincluding through at least October 13, 2022. \n36 173. No record is before the Court indicating any material change in fact since October \n13, 2022, nor does the Court have any basis to find any such material change.14 \nDISCUSSION \nI. Legal Standards \nThe Court adheres to, adopts, and hereby incorporates by reference its analysis of the \nlegal standards governing the issuance of writs of attachment (including its discussion of Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 69( a)(l) and 10 Del. C. \u00a7 5031) with respect to property of an agency or \ninstrumentality of a foreign sovereign as set out in Crysta/lex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 388-89, 394-\n95, 399-401, 404-05, including to the extent modified on appeal by the Third Circuit in \nCrysta/lex II, 932 F.3d at 134, 136, 144-46. The Court further adheres to, adopts, and hereb y \nincorporates by reference its analysis of the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (\"FSIA\" or \"Act\"), \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 et seq., including the immunities (and exceptions to immunity) for a foreign \nsovereign and its property in the United States see Crysta/lex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 394-99, 401, \n406, again including to the extent modified on appeal by the Third Circuit in Crysta/lex II, 932 \nF.3d at 140-47, 149-51. \nMoreover, as the Third Circui t explained in Crysta/lex II, 932 F.3d at 137, \"a district \ncourt has jurisdiction to enforce a federal judgment against a foreign sovereign when it is \nregistered \" in the District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963, which is indisputably the case here with \n14 In another judgment creditor action against the Republic of Venezuela , Gold Reserve Inc. v. \nBolivarian Republic ofVenez., Misc. No. 22-453 (D.I. 15 at 1 & n.1), intervenor PDVSA advised \nthe Court of the Venezuelan National Assembly's revised Transition Statute, adopted in \nDecember 2022, which in relevant part removed Mr. Guaid6 from his position as Interim \nPresident of Venezuela . The issue of whether this is a post-April 2021 (or post October 13, \n2022) material factual change has not been addressed by the parties or the Court in the Gold \nReserve Action. More importantl y for today's purposes, no party in any of the four actions \naddressed by this Opinion has provided notice of the same to the Court. The Court infers from \nthe concerted , collective silence of these (generally highly-litigious) parties that they continue to \nagree there has been no material factual change since April 30, 2021. \n37 respect to all four creditors. Therefore , the Court has jurisdiction over the Republic of \nVenezuela in all four actions being considered in this Opinion. The Court also has jurisdiction \nover PDVSA in these actions because, as the Third Circuit held in the analogous circumstances \nof Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 139, \"so long as PDVSA is Venezuela 's alter ego under Bancec, the \nDistrict Court ha[s] the power to issue a writ of attachment on that entity's non-immune assets to \nsatisfy the judgment against the country.\" \nThe FSIA does not address the circumstances under which an agency or instrumentality \nof a foreign state may be treated effectively as the sovereign state itself for purposes of the \nfarmer's property being used to pay the debts of the latter. Thus, to determine whether the \ncreditors have rebutted the strong presumption of separateness between PDVSA and Venezuela , \nthe Court applies standards developed pursuant to federal common law, particularly in two \nSupreme Court cases: First Nat'! City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 \nU.S. 611, 627 (1983) (\"Bancec\") , and Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 138 S. Ct. 816, 823 \n(2018) (\"Rubin\"). The Bancec/Rubin doctrine \"exists specifically to enable federal courts, in \ncertain circumstances, to disregard the corporate separateness of foreign sovereigns to avoid the \nunfair results from a rote application of the immunity provisions provided by the Sovereign \nImmunities Act.\" Crysta/lex II, 932 F.3d at 139. \nIn Bancec, the Supreme Court explained that the \"presumption [of separateness] may be \novercome in certain circumstances, \" including : (1) \"where a corporate entity is so extensively \ncontrolled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created, we have held that one \nmay be held liable for the actions of the other,\" and \"[i]n addition\" (2) where adhering to \"the \nbroader equitable principle\" of corporate separateness \"would work fraud or injustice.\" 462 U.S. \nat 628-29 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is \"a disjunctive test for when the separate \n38 identities of sovereign and instrumentality should be disregarded, \" Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 140, \nand a finding of \"'extensive[] control\"' by the former over the latter can be sufficient, id \n(quoting Rubin, 138 S. Ct. at 823). \nThe Supreme Court recently clarified the five factors most prominently used to conduct \nan extensive control ( or alter ego) analysis, articulating them as follows: \n(1) the level of economic control by the government; \n(2) whether the entity's profits go to the government; \n(3) the degree to which government officials manage the \nentity or otherwise have a hand in its daily affairs; \n(4) whether the government is the real beneficiary of the \nentity's conduct; and \n(5) whether adherence to separate identities would entitle \nthe foreign state to benefits in United States courts \nwhile avoiding its obligations. \nRubin, 138 S. Ct. at 823; see also Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 141. There is no \"mechanical \nformula,\" Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 141 (quoting Bancec, 462 U.S. at 633); these tests \"are \nmeant to aid case-by-case analysis\" of specific records in order to identify situations involving \nextensive control, id. In this Opinion, the Court will apply the Rubin formulation (which will \nsometimes be referred to as the \"Bancec/Rubin\" factors, test, or standard) , as the Third Circuit \ndid in Crystal/ex II. As was true in Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 141 n.8, \"[e]ither inquiry [i.e., \nBancec or Rubin] compels the same result.\" 932 F.3d at 141 n.8. \nImportantly, the Bancec/Rubin factors are not exhaustive of all the considerations that go \ninto an alter ego analysis. Nor is it necessary , in order to prove an alter ego relationship , that the \nmoving party be able to demonstrate that all of the Bancec/Rubin factors favor such a conclusion. \nSee generally Rubin, 138 S. Ct. at 823. \n39 The burden of making the appropriate showing rests on the party seeking to rebut the \npresumption of separateness , which here are the judgment creditors. See also Hester Int 'l Corp. \nv. Fed. Republic of Nigeria, 879 F.2d 170, 179 (5th Cir. 1989); Foremost-McKesson , Inc. v. \nIslamic Republic of Iran, 905 F.2d 438,447 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (\"It is further clear that the plaintiff \nbears the burden of asserting facts sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss regarding the \nagency relationship\"). As the Third Circuit has confirmed , \"preponderance of the evidence is the \nappropriate burden of proof' by which the creditors must prove their case, considering the \nBancec/Rubin factors. Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 144-46. \nII. OIEG And Huntington Have Proven That PDVSA Remains The Alter Ego of \nVenezuela Under The Guaido Government \nThe Venezuela Parties ( and, to a large extent, the creditors) contend that the appropriate \nanalysis of whether PDVSA is the Republic 's alter ego must focus on the relationship between \nthe Guaid6 Government and PDVSA in the United States. The Court agrees. \nThe Guaid6 Government's acts are the pertinent acts for the alter ego analysis because \nthe Guaid6 Government is recognized by the United States as the legitimate government of \nVenezuela. The recognition of a foreign government is a power reserved exclusively to the \nExecutive Branch of the United States government. See Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 18-19, \n30 (2015) (discussing the Executive Branch's \"exclusive\" formal recognition power). Federal \ncourts have no authority to question a decision by the Executive Branch on this issue. See \nUnited States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324, 330 (1937) (addressing Executive Branch's \"authority to \nspeak as the sole organ\" of government on external affairs). Thus, the fact that, in the litigation \nbefore this Court, the Republic is represented by the Guaid6 Government , and the further fact \nthat the Guaid6 Government exclusivel y holds all rights and interests to the Republic 's property \nin the United States, are facts that cannot be disputed by any parties in these actions or second-\n40 guessed by this Court. See Zivotofsky , 576 U.S. at 18-19; Pfizer v. Government of India, 434 \nU.S. 308, 319-20 (1978); United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203,229 (1942); Guaranty Tr. Co. v. \nUnited States, 304 U.S. 126, 137-38 (1938); Belmont, 301 U.S. at 327-30 (1937); see also Nat'! \nUnion Fire Ins. Co. v. Republic of China, 254 F.2d 177, 186 (4th Cir. 1958); The Maret, 145 \nF.2d 431,442 (3d Cir. 1944). \nAn additional reason for the Court's conclusion is that the property the creditors are \nseeking to attach is located in the United States. This, too, suggests that the focus of the alter ego \nanalysis should be on the United States. \nAlthough the Court disagrees with the arguments some creditors make that the focus \nmust be on the relationship between the Maduro Regime and PDVSA in Venezuela, even under \nthis view (which is an alternate ground asserted by at least some creditors) the creditors have met \ntheir burden, as explained later in this Opinion. Additionally , although the Court agrees with the \nVenezuela Parties that the focus must be on the relationship between the Guaid6 Government \nand PDVSA in the U.S., it does not agree that this holding renders the \"facts on the ground\" in \nVenezuela entirely irrelevant to the proper alter ego analysis. Given that this analysis is meant to \nconsider the totality of the circumstances , and is to have some flexibility to be applied to vastly \ndivergent factual realities, there may be some relevance (though certainly not predominance) to \nthe relationship between the Maduro Regime and PDVSA in Venezuela. (The Court's \nconclusions would not be any different if it treated the Maduro-related facts as utterly irrelevant.) \nConsidering the record created in the OIEG and Huntington Actions and applying that \nrecord to the Bancec/Rubin factors, the Court concludes that OIEG and Huntington have proven, \nby a preponderance of the evidence , that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela. In particular , the \nGuaid6 Government exercises such extensive direction and control over PDVSA in the U.S. as to \n41 render PDVSA the alter ego of Venezuela . Each of the Rubin factors is supported by extensive \nevidence (see supra Parts IV, V, & VI), some of which is summarized below.15 \nThe Guaid6 Government maintains extensive economic control over PDVSA. Venezuela \ntreats PDVSA's assets as its own. The Guaid6 Government has accessed PDVSA's U.S. \nsubsidiaries ' assets in the United States and used them to fund itself, bypassing any right PDVSA \nmay have had to corporate dividends. The Guaid6 Government has also used PDVSA assets to \nfund Venezuela 's legal defense. On occasion, PDVSA has started, only later to stop, paying its \ndebts at the direction of Venezuela. President Guaid6 announced that he intends to treat \nVenezuela's debts and PDVSA's debts the same in an eventual debt restructuring. Economic \ncontrol of PDVSA remains as engrafted in Venezuela 's Constitution now as it was in August \n2018. In Crystallex II, 932 F.3d at 147, the Third Circuit emphasized that these constitutional \nprovisions result in substantial control over PDVSA and the Venezuelan oil industry, and this is \nno less true today. \nUnder the Guaid6 Government , PDVSA's profits go to Venezuela, which remains the \nsole shareholder in PDVSA. See id. at 148. \nThe Guaid6 Government , acting through PDVSA's Ad Hoc Board, which the \ngovernment appointed , exercises control over PDVSA's daily activities. PDVSA's Ad Hoc \nBoard has acknowledged that it operates under \"directives \" from the Guaid6 Government. In \nlitigation in U.S. courts, the Ad Hoc Board has noted that Venezuelan law gives the National \n15 The Court's decision to highlight only certain of the many findings of fact contained in this \nOpinion does not mean that the other findings of fact have no impact on the Court's analysis. \nThe Court's conclusion that the creditors have proven PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego is based, \nas it must be, on the totality of the evidence. In part because the evidence of Venezuela's \nextensive direction and control over PDVSA is so overwhelming, and in part for simplicity \n(since the detailed findings of fact are set out earlier in this Opinion) , the Court's Discussion is \nabbreviated . \n42 Assembly the authority to approve any \"public interest contract\" PDVSA enters into and that, in \nits view, \"any\" PDVSA contract is a public interest contract. \nThe Guaid6 Government is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct. Among other \nthings, the Guaid6 Government has used PDVSA funds to conduct its legal defense. Mr. Guaid6 \nand his government regularly characterize PDVSA and its related assets as assets of the Republic \nitself. \nFinally, adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. \ncourts while allowing Venezuela to avoid its obligations. The Third Circuit's holding on this \npoint in Crystallex II is equally applicable in the OIEG and Huntington Actions (and also in the \nACL and Rusoro Actions): \nVenezuela owes [the judgment creditors] from ... judgment[s] that \nha[ ve] been affirmed in our courts. Any outcome where [ a creditor \nbefore the Court] is not paid means that Venezuela has avoided its \nobligations. It is likewise clear from the record that PDVSA, and \nby extension Venezuela, derives significant benefits from the U.S. \njudicial system. Its 2020 bonds are backed by the common stock \nand underlying assets ofU.S.-based corporations , and hence \ndisputes stemming from default will be subject to U.S. laws and \npresumably be resolved through the U.S. legal system. Indeed, it \nis probable the U.S. legal system is the backstop that gives \nsubstantial assurance to investors who buy PDVSA's debt. \n932 F.3d at 149. \nIn sum, then, considering the totality of the joint record made out in the OIEG and \nHuntington Actions, and carefully evaluating that record in light of the Bancec/Rubin factors -\nwhile recognizing that these factors are neither exhaustive nor mandatory -the Court concludes \nthat PDVSA in the United States is the alter ego of Venezuela under the Guaid6 Government. \n43 III. ACL Has Proven That PDVSA Remains The Alter Ego of Venezuela Under The \nGuaido Government \nACL did not participate in the April 2021 hearing and did not otherwise expressly agree \nto adopt the evidentiary record from OIEG's and Huntington 's cases. Nevertheless , ACL \nsupplied its own evidence which in all material respects matches the record in the other two \nactions already discussed. (See ACL Action D.I. 49, 51)16 Therefore , and for the same reasons, \nthe Court also concludes that ACL has established, by a preponderance of the evidence , that the \nGuaid6 Government extensively controls PDVSA such that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego. \nA brief summary of the evidence ACL presented in support of this conclusion is as \nfollows: \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government maintains extensive economic control over PDVSA through \nprovisions in the Venezuela Constitution (ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r 21), by controlling \nPDVSA's ability to make payments on its bonds and to the Maduro Regime (id. D.I. \n49 ,r,r 24, 31-32), requiring National Assembly approval for PDVSA to pay its legal \nfees (id. D.I. 49 ,r 30), having access to PDVSA income (id. D.I. 51 ,r 29), and by not \ndistinguishing between Venezuela 's and PDVSA's assets (id. D.I. 49 ,r 33). \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government receives PDVSA's profits, as PDVSA is wholly owned by \nVenezuela. (ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r,r 4-5; see also id. D.I. 51 ,r 29) \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government manages PDVSA, including by exercising its powers under \nthe Transition Statute, which enable the National Assembly to exercise veto power \nover PDVSA's business contracts (ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r,r 23-25) and allow Guaid6 to \nappoint the Ad Hoc Board (id. D.I. 49 ,r,r 26-27), and also by closely monitoring the \nday-to-day workings of PDVSA (id. D.I. 49 ,r,r 34-35, 38). \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct (see, e.g., ACL \nAction D.I. 49 ,r 35). \n\u2022 Adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. courts \nwhile avoiding its obligations , for the same reasons already given above on this very \nsame point with respect to OIEG's and Huntington's motions. (See supra Discussion \nPart II) \n16 Any paragraph containing an ACL proposed finding of fact that the Court refers to by number \nis a finding of fact the Court is adopting as its own. \n44 IV. Rusoro Has Proven That PDVSA Remains The Alter Ego of Venezuela Under The \nGuaid6 Government \nRusoro did not participate in the April 2021 Hearing and did not otherwise expressly \nagree to adopt the evidentiary record in OIEG's and Huntington 's cases. Nevertheless, Rusoro \nsupplied its own evidence which in all material respects matches the record in the other actions \nalready discussed. (See Rusoro Action D.I. 35, 38)17 Therefore , and for the same reasons, the \nCourt also concludes that Rusoro has established , by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \nGuaid6 Government extensively controls PDVSA such that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego. \nA brief summary of the evidence Rusoro presented in support of this conclusion is as \nfollows: \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government maintains extensive economic control over PDVSA. (See \nRusoro Action D.I. 35 ,r 55; id. D.I. 38 ,r,r 5-8) \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government receives PDVSA's profits, as PDVSA is wholly owned by \nVenezuela. (Rusoro Action D.I. 34 ,r 16)18 \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government manages PDVSA. (Rusoro Action D.I. 35 ,r,r 56, 61; id. \nD.I. 38 ,r,r 11-17) \n\u2022 The Guaid6 Government is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct. (Rusoro \nAction D.I. 35 ,r 57; id. D.I. 38 ,r,r 18-19) \n\u2022 Adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. courts \nwhile avoiding its obligations , for the same reasons already given above on this very \nsame point with respect to OIEG's and Huntington 's motions. (See supra Discussion \nPart II) \n17 Any paragraph containing a Rusoro proposed finding of fact that the Court refers to by number \nis a finding of fact the Court is adopting as its own. \n18 The Court adopts this finding of fact, proposed by PDVSA, as its own finding. \n45 V. OIEG And Huntington Have Proven That PDVSA Remains The Alter Ego of \nVenezuela Under The Maduro Regime \nThe Court has held that the proper focus for the alter ego analysis is on the relationship \nbetween the recognized Guaid6 Government and PDVSA in the United States. However , the \nCourt has before it, additionally , a record of the relationship between the Maduro Regime and \nPDVSA in Venezuela. The four creditors the Court is considering in this Opinion argue, to \nvarying degrees (i.e., as either their principal argument or as an alternative basis for the relief \nthey seek), that the alter ego analysis can meaningfull y be undertaken with respect to the Maduro \nRegime and PDVSA in Venezuela. The Court agrees that this alternate approach leads to the \nsame conclusion: PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela . 19 \n19 \"[R]ecognition or nonrecognition of the decrees of an unrecognized government which \nactually governs [is] a political matter for the sole determination of the Executive.\" The Maret, \n145 F.2d at 440. Nevertheless , while the Executive Branch's determination of which of \nVenezuela 's governments is recognized as legitimate \"is conclusive on all domestic courts,\" \ncourts still \"are free to draw for themselves its legal consequences in litigations pending before \nthem.\" Guar. Tr. Co. of NY, 304 U.S. at 138; see also Republic of Iraq v. ABB AG, 920 F. \nSupp. 2d 517, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), ajf'd 768 F.3d 145 (2d Cir. 2014) (\"The legitimacy or \nillegitimacy of the Hussein Regime's rule does not affect whether the Regime's acts may be \nattributed to the Republic of Iraq. Indeed, Courts have attributed conduct of allegedly unlawful \nregimes to the states they purported to represent. . . . [ A ]ttribution operates independently of \ndiplomatic recognition .... What matters is control.\"); Salimojf & Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 262 \nN.Y. 220,227 (1933) (\"The courts may not recognize the Soviet government as the dejure \ngovernment until the State Department gives the word. They may, however, say that it is a \ngovernment , maintaining internal peace and order, providing for national defense and the general \nwelfare, carrying on relations with our own government and others. To refuse to recognize that \nSoviet Russia is a government regulating the internal affairs of the country, is to give to fictions \nan air ofreality which they do not deserve.\"). Thus, for example, in cases like The Denny, 127 \nF .2d 404, 410 (3d Cir. 1942), courts have explained that they \"may not ignore the fact that the \n[ non-recognized] government did actually exercise governmental authority in [ a country] at the \ntime the decrees in question were made and the powers of attorney were given.\" See also Bridas \nS.A.P.IC. v. Gov't a/Turkmenistan , 447 F.3d 411,416 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating that courts must \nlook to \"reality and not form\" in making alter ego determination). Based on these and similar \nauthorities , the Court does not believe that the Maduro Regime's conduct in Venezuela is \nentirely irrelevant to the required alter ego analysis. \n46 Applying the Bancec/Rubin factors to the record jointly admitted in the OIEG and \nHuntington Actions, the Court concludes that these creditors have proven, by a preponderance of \nthe evidence, that PDVSA in Venezuela is the alter ego of Venezuela under the Maduro Regime. \nA selection of the evidence (all of which is set out in detail in the Court's findings of fact, see \nsupra) leading the Court to this conclusion follows: \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime exercises extensive economic control over PDVSA in \nVenezuela, as evidenced by, among other things, Mr. Maduro's announcement of \ngasoline price increases PDVSA subsequently enacted, the government's \nannouncement of a corporate transaction executed by a PDVSA subsidiary, and \nExecutive Order 4.090 (by which Mr. Maduro authorized PDVSA to take actions \nwith respect to owners of licensed service stations). \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime profits from PDVSA's operations , as the Republic is the sole \nshareholder of PDVSA. \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime manages PDVSA, as evidenced by, among other things, Mr. \nMaduro's appointment of members of PDVSA's Board (including appointments of \ngovernment officials, including a Minister of Oil) and his appointment of high-level \nofficers at PDVSA, at one of its subsidiaries , and at a CITGO entity. \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct, as evidenced by, \namong other things, the government's use of PDVSA property (including airplanes) \nfor government activities, Mr. Maduro's use of PDVSA petroleum to support \nVenezuela's foreign policy (including with respect to Cuba and China), and \nPDVSA's website's declaration that one of its strategic objectives is to \"[s]upport the \ngeopolitical positioning of Venezuela internationally.\" \n\u2022 Adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. courts \nwhile avoiding its obligations , for the same reasons already given above on this very \nsame point. (See supra Discussion Part II) \nVI. ACL Has Proven That PDVSA Remains The Alter Ego of Venezuela Under The \nMaduro Regime \nACL did not participate in the April 2021 Hearing and did not otherwise expressly agree \nto adopt the evidentiary record in OIEG's and Huntington 's cases. Nevertheless, ACL supplied \nits own evidence which in all material respects matches the record in the other two actions \n47 already discussed. (See ACL Action D.I. 49, 51)20 Therefore, and for the same reasons, the \nCourt also concludes that ACL has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \nMaduro Regime extensively controls PDVSA such that PDVSA is Venezuela's alter ego. \nA brief summary of the evidence ACL presented in support of this conclusion is as \nfollows: \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime maintains extensive economic control over PDVSA in numerous \nways, including by exercising its powers under the Venezuelan Constitution , by Mr. \nMaduro ordering PDVSA's office in Lisbon to be relocated to Moscow, causing \nPDVSA to sell oil products at below-market prices for political ends, and causing \nPDVSA to deliver oil to China to service Venezuela 's sovereign debt and to Cuba to \nsupport Venezuela's political ally. (ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r,r 16, 19, 21; see also \nBarger Deel. Ex. 2) \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime receives PDVSA's profits, as PDVSA is wholly owned by \nVenezuela. (ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r,r 4-5; see also id. D.I. 51 ,r 29) \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime manages PDVSA, including by exercising appointment power, \nrequiring PDVSA employees to avoid publicly opposing governmental aims, and \nusing PDVSA aircraft for travel by government officials. (ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r,r 15, \n17-18) \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime is the real beneficiary of PDVSA's conduct, as evidenced by the \nexecution by Venezuela of a deal under which PDVSA was required to deliver \napproximately $260 million of crude oil to supply food for a government program. \n(ACL Action D.I. 49 ,r 20) \n\u2022 Adherence to separate identities would entitle Venezuela to benefits in U.S. courts \nwhile avoiding its obligations , for the same reasons already given above on this very \nsame point.

(See \nRusoro Action D.I. 35 ,r,r 12-16, 20, 31-33, 36-38, 40-41) \n\u2022 The Maduro Regime receives PDVSA's profits, as PDVSA is wholly owned by \nVenezuela.

(See supra Discussion Part II) \nVIII. The Creditors Have Proven That PDVSA Is The Alter Ego Of Venezuela As Of All \nPotentially Pertinent Dates \nIn Crysta/lex Int'! Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic ofVenez., Misc. No. 17-151-LPS, 2021 \nWL 129803, at *6 (D. Del. Jan. 14, 2021), this Court held that \"the pertinent time\" for purposes \nof an alter ego analysis is \"the period between the filing of the motion seeking a writ of \nattachment and the subsequent issuance and service of that writ.\" The Court continues to adhere \n21 Again, any paragraph containing a Rusoro proposed finding of fact that the Court refers to by \nnumber is a finding of fact the Court is adopting as its own. \n22 Once again, the Court adopts this proposed finding of fact of PDVSA's as its own finding of \nfact. \n49 to this view.23 It reflects the reality that the judgment creditors' actions are brought against the \nproperty of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (i.e., the property of its alter ego, PDVSA, \nfound in this District) and not against PDVSA itself. It follows that this Court is only able to \ngrant the relief sought by the judgment creditors so long as Venezuela has property in this \nDistrict. Since the focus is on the property, and not the party, what matters is the location and \nownership status of the property, characteristics that can change at any time. This strongly \nsuggests to the Court that the pertinent time has to be related to the time that the judgment \ncreditor seeks to attach the property of the judgment debtor and not, by contrast, some \n(potentially distant) time in the past (e.g., the time of the injury that gave rise to the creditor's \njudgment). \nBecause the Court continues to conclude that the pertinent time is the period between the \nfiling of the motion seeking a writ of attachment and the subsequent issuance and service of that \nwrit, in evaluating the motions of the four creditors the Court is considering in this Opinion the \npertinent times for the Court's alter-ego determination are as follows: (i) for OIEG, from the date \nof filing of its renewed attachment motion on February 19, 2021 through the date of issuance \nand/or service of the writ; (ii) for Huntington , from the date of filing of its amended motion on \nFebruary 19, 2021 through the date of issuance and/or service of the writ; (iii) for ACL, from the \ndate of filing of its motion on November 22, 2021 through the date of issuance and/or service of \n23 In May 2022, Court certified the pertinent-time question for interlocutory appeal, in this \nformulation: \"Whether the pertinent time for conducting an alter ego analysis with respect to the \nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Petr6leos de Venezuela, S.A. is: (i) the period between a \njudgment creditor filing a motion seeking a writ of attachment and the subsequent issuance and \nservice of the writ, (ii) the time of the injury that gave rise to the judgment creditor's judgment , \nor (iii) some other time.\" (E.g., OIEG Action D.I. 114) The Third Circuit denied the petitions \nfor leave to appeal that followed. See, e.g., Crystallex Int'! Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of \nVenez., No. 22-8024 D.I. 28 (3d Cir. July 26, 2022). \n50 the writ; and (iv) for Rusoro, from the date of filing of its motion on February 9, 2022 through \nthe date of issuance and/or service of the writ. \nThe Court recognizes that the judgment creditors disagree with the Court's pertinent time \nanalysis. OIEG, Huntington, ACL, and Rusoro all argue that the pertinent time is the time they \nwere injured via the expropriation of their assets: OIEG in 2010 when the Chavez regime \nexpropriated two of OIEG's glass factories (OIEG Action D.I. 49 at 2); Huntington in February \n2018 (Huntington Action D.I. 64 Ex. 1 at 17; id. D.I. 64 at 2 (\"facts pertinent to the moment the \ndebt arose are the only pertinent facts\"); ACL in January 2018, when Venezuela failed to make \ntimely payments on its bonds, or in December 2018, when the full principal became due (ACL \nAction D.I. 3 at 10, 14); and Rusoro in 2011, when its property and gold-mining rights were \nseized by Venezuela (Rusoro Action D.I. 4 Ex. 1 at 3, 27). Alternatively , the creditors contend \nthat the pertinent date is August 2018, because as of that date the Venezuela Parties have been \nbarred by collateral estoppel from arguing against an alter-ego finding, due to the Court's ruling \nin Crysta/lex I. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 49 at 23-25; Huntington Action D.I. 64 Ex. 1 at 6-8; \nsee ACL Action D.I. 3 at 14-15; Rusoro Action D.I. 4 Ex. 1 at 26-28) The Court has already \nrejected this position and continues to do so. \nThe record before the Court, and the Court's findings with respect to that record, is \nsufficient such that the Court finds, in the alternative, that if the pertinent dates begin on the date \nof injury, as identified just above, each of the four judgment creditors has proven, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that PDVSA was the alter ego on all such pertinent dates, \ncontinuing at least through October 13, 2022. The Court reaches these conclusions based on the \nsame findings of fact given above and throughout this Opinion, based on its consideration of the \nBancec/Rubin factors. \n51 IX. Venezuela Parties' Counter-Arguments \nIn addition to the arguments and objections that have already been addressed in \nconnection with the analysis above, the Court here discusses certain additional contentions made \nby the Venezuela Parties. raised by the Venezuela Parties. \nFirst, throughout these proceedings , the Venezuela Parties have maintained that the \nOF AC regulations \"broadly prohibit any conceivable steps toward enforcing a judgment against \nblocked property, such as the PDVH shares, without a license.\"24 (E.g., Huntington Action D.I. \n32 at 27) More specifically , the Venezuela Parties have argued that \"resolution of the alter ego \nissue in favor of [the judgment creditors] ... would alter or affect PDVSA's interests in the \nPDVH shares and create an interest in the PDVH shares,\" which is prohibited by the sanctions \nregime in the absence of a specific license from OFAC. (E.g., OIEG Action D.I. 101 at 1;25 see \nalso id. D.I. 65 at 29-30 (creditor cannot obtain \"contingent priority interest in the PDVH shares in \nthe absence of a specific license from OFAC\"); id. D.I. 95 at 2-5 (\"any order or judicial process \nthat purports to create a future or contingent interest, or otherwise alters or affects directly or \nindirectly any right or interest in the PDVH shares, in the absence of a license would be a \nnullity\"); ACL Action D.I. 22 at 4, 30-32; Rusoro Action D.I. 33 at 2 n.2, 18-19) The Venezuela \nParties relatedly argue that OF AC sanctions disallow the Court from \"making findings of fact \ntending to establish that PDVSA is the alter ego of Venezuela ,\" regardless of whether the Court \norders issuance and service of any writ. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 95 at 7-9; see also id. D.I. \n101 at 8-10) If the Court were to issue findings of fact or were to conditionally grant a motion \n24 The Republic submitted filings in the OIEG Action, but not in the Huntington, ACL, or Rusoro \nActions. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 11-13, 18-19, 30, 39, 44, 69, 75, 98, 123, 126) \n25 PDVSA filed identical post-hearing briefs in the OIEG and Huntington Actions. (See OIEG \nAction D.I. 95, 101; Huntington Action D.I. 51, 53) For convenience , in this section the Court \ncites only to the version of the briefs filed in the OIEG Action. \n52 for writ of attachment, the Venezuela Parties continue, the Court would be acting inconsistently \nwith the Article III doctrines of standing, ripeness, and mootness, or otherwise rendering an \nadvisory opinion. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 95 at 9-13; id. D.I. 101 at 10-13); Huntington \nAction D.I. 32 at 28; ACL Action D.I. 22 at 30-33; id. D.I. 32 at 7-10); Rusoro Action D.I. 33 at \n20) \nThe Court rejected each of these contentions in its March 2, 2022 Opinion, holding that \n\"the OF AC sanctions regime does not require a specific license before the Court may enter an \norder authorizing the eventual issuance of a writ of attachment.\" (E.g., OIEG Action D.I. 109 at \n18)26 The Court also held that \"no OF AC license is required before it may issue findings of fact \nregarding whether PDVSA is the Republic's alter ego.\" (Id. at 17 n.13) The Court further \nrejected PDVSA's ripeness challenge and other \"vague\" Article III challenges, concluding it has \njurisdiction under Article III. (See, e.g., March 2022 Op. at 8-11, 12 & n.9) The Court adheres \nto and hereby incorporates by reference the analysis and conclusions it reached in the March \n2022 Opinion. \nRusoro is the only judgment creditor whose case is addressed in the instant Opinion and \nwas not a party to the March 2022 Opinion. With respect to Rusoro, the Venezuela Parties \nincorporate their prior arguments by reference. (See, e.g., Rusoro Action D.I. 33 at 2 n.2, 18-20) \nAccordingly, the Court rejects these arguments for the same reasons provided in the March 2022 \nOpinion. \nSecond, PDVSA has moved to dismiss these judgment creditor actions for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction and lack of personal jurisdiction under the FSIA. (See OIEG Action \n26 The March 2022 Opinion was also docketed in the Huntington Action (D.I. 58) and the ACL \nAction (D.I. 33). \n53 D.I. 64; Huntington Action D.I. 31; ACL Action D.I. 21; see also Rusoro Action D.I. 32 (also \nseeking dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Article III and to vacate Rusoro's \nregistered judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4)) The Court concludes \nit has subject-matter jurisdiction over all the actions against Venezuela it is addressing in this \nOpinion.27 \nIn Crystallex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 399, \"the Court ha[d] subject matter jurisdiction over \nVenezuela under\u00a7 1605(a)(6)(A) due to Crystallex 's $1.2 billion arbitral award against \nVenezuela, which was confirmed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \nand is now registered in the District of Delaware. \" Similarly , here, (a) OIEG has an arbitral \naward against Venezuela, which was confirmed by the DC Court and is now registered in this \nDistrict (see OIEG Action D.I. 1; id. D.I. 3 at 1-3); (b) Huntington has an arbitral award against \nVenezuela, which was confirmed by the Southern District of Mississippi and subsequently \nregistered in this District (Huntington Action D.I. 1; id. D.I. 4 at 1-2 & n.1); (c) ACL registered \nits judgment against Venezuela from the Southern District ofNew York in this District and \nVenezuela \"irrevocably waive(d]\" \"immunity from suit\" (ACL Action D.I. 1; id. D.I. 3 at 15-16); \nand ( d) Rusoro has an arbitral award against Venezuela , confirmed by the DC Court and \nregistered in this District (Rusoro Action D.I. 1; id. D.I. 4 Ex. 1 at 3-4). \nBecause the Court has concluded that PDVSA is the alter-ego of Venezuela in all of these \nactions, and because the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Venezuela in all of these \n27 To the extent that PDVSA is challenging the justiciability of Rusoro's pending attachment \nmotion under Article III (see Rusoro Action D.I. 33 at 1 n.1 ), the Court already rejected \nPDVSA's position in the March 2022 Opinion at 12 n.9. PDVSA also moves to vacate Rusoro's \nregistered judgment, alleging that even registration of a judgment violates the OF AC sanctions \nregime. (See id. D.I. 33 at 5, 19-20) As PDVSA acknowledges (see, e.g., id. D.I. 33 at 2 n.2), \nthe Court has already rejected these positions , and does so again here. (See, e.g., March 2022 \nOpinion at 19-20) \n54 actions under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a), \"the Court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction with \nrespect to PDVSA as well.\" Crystal/ex I, 333 F.3d at 394. PDVSA's personal-jurisdiction \nargument is entirely premised on the Court agreeing with PDVSA that the Court lacks subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction and that PDVSA was never properly served. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 65 \nat 9 n.2; Huntington Action D.I. 32 at 1 n.1; ACL Action D.I. 22 1 n.1; Rusoro Action D.I. 33 1 \nn.1) The Court does not agree with PDVSA on these points. Moreover , PDVSA intervened in \nthese actions (see OIEG Action D.I. 57; Huntington Action D.I. 19; ACL Action D.I. 13; Rusoro \nAction D.I. 14), did not object to personal jurisdiction at the time, and is (as the Court has found) \nthe alter ego of Venezuela. For this combination of reasons, the Court may exercise personal \njurisdiction over PDVSA in all of the above-captioned actions. Accordingly , PDVSA's cross\u00ad\nmotions to dismiss ( OIEG Action D.I. 64; Huntington Action D.I. 31; ACL Action D.I. 21; \nRusoro Action D.I. 32) will be denied. \nThird, the Venezuela Parties argue that Delaware law applies to this proceeding , that it \nprecludes attachment of the PDVH shares absent a showing of fraud, and that the judgment \ncreditors have not made a showing of fraud. (See, e.g., OIEG Action D.I. 65 at 31-35; id D.I. 69 \nat 1 4; id D.I. 98 at 4-6; Huntington Action D.I. 32 at 29-30; ACL Action D.I. 22 at 33-35; \nRusoro Action D.I. 33 at 17-18) This Court and the Third Circuit have previously rejected these \ncontentions . See Crystal/ex II, 932 F.3d at 145 (\"Bancec is binding federal common law for \ndisputes under the [FSIA].\"); Crystal/ex I, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 397 (explaining fraud is not \nrequired under governing federal common law). No new or persuasive arguments have been \nprovided in the actions addressed in this Opinion ( even assuming , for the sake of argument, the \nCourt were free to revisit this issue). Thus, the Court adheres to and hereby adopts and \nincorporates by reference its holding and analysis in its earlier rejections of these positions. \n55 Fourth, the Venezuela Parties emphasize that the Republic of Venezuela is PDVSA's sole \nshareholder, giving the Republic all the same extensive rights any controlling shareholder would \nhave, and suggesting that the evidence shows nothing more than the kinds of actions any \ncontrolling shareholder might take with respect to a corporate entity it controls. See generally \nGater Assets Ltd v. Moldovagaz , 2 F.4th 42, 55-56 (2d Cir. 2021) (\"To qualify as sufficiently \nextensive under Bancec, the sovereign 's control over an entity must rise above the level that \ncorporations would normally tolerate from significant shareholders or expect from government \nregulators. \"). For instance, a controlling shareholder may have the right to appoint directors and \nto be provided with information about a company's operations. See generally Arch Trading \nCorp. v. Republic of Ecuador, 839 F.3d 193,203 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"[C]ourts have consistentl y \nrejected the argument that the appointment or removal of an instrumentality 's officers or \ndirectors, standing alone, overcomes the Bancec presumption\") (internal quotation marks \nomitted). The Court recognizes these realities. However, for all the reasons set out in detail \nthroughout this Opinion, the Court finds that the Republic is regularly exercising powers far \nbeyond those accorded to it through its role as sole and controlling shareholder of PDVSA. (See, \ne.g., April 2021 Tr. at 251-54 (Huntington counsel describing evidence of commingling of \nVenezuela and PDVSA funds, use of government funds to pay corporation 's lawyers, and \narguing, persuasively , that no \"normal shareholder would ... be able to get at and make direct \norders of second -third, and fourth-order subsidiaries without going through the company it \nactually owns\")) Moreover , actions taken by the Republic that happen to correspond to actions \nany controlling shareholder may be empowered to take do not, thereby, lose all probative value \nin an alter ego analysis. Fundamentall y, after according all of the facts found here their \nappropriate weight, including the fact that Venezuela is PDVSA's sole shareholder , the Court \n56 has found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Venezuela directs and controls PDVSA to an \nextent and in a manner rendering PDVSA the alter ego of Venezuela. \nFinally, as already noted, the Venezuela Parties insist that the Court's consideration of \nthe Maduro Regime's actions is inconsistent with caselaw in this area. (See, e.g., OIEG Action \nD.I. 11 at 11-12 & n.12; id D.I. 65 at 11-12, 14-20; id D.I. 69 at 3-4; id D.I. 101 at 15-20; \nHuntington Action D.I. 53 at 15-20; ACL Action D.I. 22 at 12-16; id D.I. 32 at 3-4; Rusoro \nAction D.I. 33 at 15-16) As the Court has stated (see supra Discussion Part II), the Court largely \nagrees and, thus, has held that the relevant analysis is of the recognized Guaid6 Government's \nrelationship with PDVSA in the United States. The Court has considered the numerous cases \nrelied on by the Venezuela Parties and finds in them no basis not to have also considered, as an \nalternative ground for its ruling, that the relationship between the Maduro Regime and PDVSA \nin Venezuela is also an alter-ego relationship.28 \n28 See, e.g., Zivotofsky, 576 U.S. at 14, 18-19, 22; Pink, 315 U.S. at 229-33; Guaranty Tr. Co., \n304 U.S. at 137-38; Belmont, 301 U.S. at 328-30; PDVSA US. Litig. Trust v. Lukoil Pan Ams. \nLLC, --F. 4th--, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 5950 (11th Cir. 2023); Nat'! Union Fire Ins. Co., 254 \nF.2d at 186-87; Latvian State Cargo & Passenger S.S. Line v. McGrath, 188 F.2d 1000, 1002-04 \n(D.C. Cir. 1951); The Maret, 145 F.2d at 433, 439-42. \n57 CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons given above, the Court will grant OIEG's, Huntington's, ACL's, and \nRusoro's motions for writs of attachment of PDVSA's shares of PDVH, as these creditors have \nrebutted the presumption that Venezuela and PDVSA are separate, as the creditors have proven, \nby a preponderance of the evidence, that in fact PDVSA is the alter ego of the judgment debtor, \nthe Republic of Venezuela. The Court has found that this alter ego relationship existed at all \npossibly pertinent dates and regardless of whether the analysis is properly focused on the \nrelationship between the Guaid6 Government and PDVSA in the United States (as the Court \nholds is the correct analysis) or, alternatively , centers on the relationship between the Maduro \nRegime and PDVSA in Venezuela. The Court will order the parties to meet and confer and \nprovide their positions on how the Court should now proceed. An appropriate order follows. \n58 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nOI EUROPEAN GROUP B.V., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBOLIV ARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA , \nDefendant. \nNORTHROP GRUMMAN SlllP SYSTEMS, INC., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nTHE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OF THE REPUBLIC OF \nVENEZUELA, \nDefendant. \nACLl INVESTMENTS LTD., ACL2 INVESTMENTS LID., \nand LDO (CAYMAN) XVIII LTD., \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBOLN ARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA , \nDefendant. \nRUSORO MINING LIMITED , \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nBOLN ARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA , \nDefendant. \nORDER Misc.
