Kyle Musgrove, PARKER POE ADAMS & BERNSTEIN, LLP, Charlotte, \nNC; \nAttorneys for Defendant. \nNovember#, 2022 \n1 Before me are Plaintiff's motions to dismiss the infringement claims and associated \ndeclaratory judgment counterclaims filed in civil actions 21-134 7 and 21-1797 (\"the ANDA \nsuits\"). (See C.A. No. 21-1347, D.I. 23; C.A. No. 21-1797, D.I. 22). I have considered the \nparties' briefing. (See C.A. No. 21-1347, D.I. 24, 28, 31; C.A. No. 21-1797, D.I. 23, 27, 30). \nFor the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motions are GRANTED. \nThe briefing for these motions is iden,tical. Thus, for convenience, I will consider them \ntogether and cite to the docket of C.A. No. 21-1347. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffmarkets the drug product Entresto\u00ae. (See D.I. 24 at 1). Entresto\u00ae includes the \ndrug compounds sacubitril and valsartan. (See id). U.S. Patent Nos. 9,517,226 (\"'226 Patent\"), \n9,937,143 ('\"143 Patent\"), and 11,135,192 (\"'192 Patent\") are listed in the FDA Orange Book for \nEntresto\u00ae. The '226, '143, and '192 patents' claims are directed to specific methods of using \nsacubitril and valsartan. (See id). \nDefendant submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") seeking FDA \napproval to market a generic version ofEntresto\u00ae (\"Defendant's ANDA product\"). (See id at 2). \nThereafter, Defendant notified Plaintiff that it had filed certifications pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n355G)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) (\"Paragraph IV certifications\") for the '226, '143, and '192 patents. (See \n'\\, \nid at 1-2). In response, Plaintiff filed the ANDA suits asserting that Defendant's ANDA product \nwill infringe the '226, '143, and '192 patents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2). (See id at 1, 6; D.I. 1 \nat ,r 30). Defendant then filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement \nand invalidity for the '226, '143, and' 192 patents. (See D.I. 24 at 1). \n2 In May 2022, Defendant informed Plaintiff that it had converted its Paragraph IV \ncertifications for the '226, '143, and '192 patents to a statement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n355G)(2)(A)(viii) (\"Section viii statement\"). (See id at 2 (citing id, Ex. A)). The Section viii \nstatement confirms that Defendant's ANDA product will not infringe any of the methods of use \nclaimed in the '226, '143, and '192 patents. (See id, Ex. A). \nPlaintiff moves to dismiss without prejudice its claims in the ANDA suits under Rule \n41(a)(2). Plaintiff also moves to dismiss I)efendant's counterclaims in the ANDA suits under \nRule 12(b)(6). \nII. LEGALSTANDARD \nA. Rule 41(a)(2) \nRule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, \"An action may be \ndismissed\u00b7 at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. \nIf a defendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff's motion to \ndismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant's objection only if the counterclaim can \nremain pending for independent adjudication. Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under \nthis paragraph (2) is without prejudice.\" \n\"[T]he grant or denial of voluntary dismissal without prejudice is a matter of judicial \ndiscretion .... \" Ockert v. Union Barge Line Corp., 190 F.2d 303, 304 (3d Cir. 1951). \"[A] court \nshould grant a plaintiff's motion for voluntary dismissal unless the dismissal will result in \nsubstantial prejudice to the defendant.\" Sanitec Indus., Inc. v. Sanitec Worldwzde, Ltd, 2006 WL \n890880, at *1 (D. Del. Apr. 3, 2006). \"The mere prospect that a defendant will face a subsequent \nI \nlawsuit is not legal prejudice.\" Reach & Assocs. v. Dencer, 2004 WL 253487, at *1 (D. Del. Feb. \n9, 2004). \n3 J In determining whether legal prejudice will result from dismissal of a claim, \"a court should \nconsider 1) any excessive and duplicative expense of a second litigation; 2) the effort and expense \nincurred by a' defendant in prepari~g for trial; 3) the extent to which the pending litigation has \nprogressed; and 4) the claimant's diligence in moving to dismiss.\" Reach & Assocs., 2004 WL \n253487, at *1 (cleaned up). \nB. Rule 12(b)(l) \nFederal Rule,of Civil Procedure 12(b)(l) permits the dismissal of a claim or an action for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. A Rule 12(b)(l) motion may be treated as either a facial or \nfactual challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d \n333, 346 (3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack contests the sufficiency of the pleadings, whereas a \nfactual attack contests the sufficiency of jurisdictional facts. See Lincoln Ben. Life Co. v. AEI \nLife, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 105 (3d Cir. 2015). When considering a facial attack, the court accepts \nthe plaintiffs well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences from \nthose allegations in the plaintiffs favor. See In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach \nLitig., 846 F.3d 625, 633 (3d Cir. 2017). The party asserting subject matter jurisdiction bears \"the \nburden of proof that jurisdiction does in fact exist.\" Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass 'n, \n549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977). \nIn declaratory judgment actions, the plaintiff must show that \"a case of actual controversy\" \nexists to establish subject matter jurisdiction sufficient to maintain an action in federal court. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). The Supreme Court has held that a \"case or controversy\" exists when \"the facts \nalleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between the \nparties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance \nof a declaratory judgment.\" Medlmmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007). \n4 \"The dispute must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse \nlegal interests .... \" Arris Grp., Inc. v. British Telecomm. PLC, 639 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. \n2011) (cleaned up). A \"subjective or speculative fear of future harm\" does not suffice. Prasco, \nLLC v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 537 F.3d 1329, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nC. Rule 12(b)(6) \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires a complainant to provide \"a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief .... \" Rule 12(b )( 6) allows \nthe accused party to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to rp.eet this standard. A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as \ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those \nallegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At!. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n544, 558 (2007). \nThe factual allegations do not have to be detailed, but they must provide more than labels, \nconclusions, or a \"formulaic recitation\" of the claim elements. Id. at 555 (\"Factual allegations \nmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all \nthe allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"). Moreover, there must be \nsufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009). The facial plausil:>ility standard is satisfied when the complaint's factual content \n\"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.\" Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's \nliability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\" \n(cleaned up)). \n5 III. DISCUSSION \nPlaintiff states that \"there is no longer an Article III case or controversy between [the \nparties] over [the '226, '143, and '192 patents]\" because Defendant's \"Sectiorrviii statement avers \nthat [Defe_ndant] is no longer seeking FDA approval for any [method of] use claimed by the ['226, \n'143, and '192] patents.\" (D.I. 24 at 1). Thus, Plaintiff argues that its claims should be dismissed \nwithout prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2) because (1) dismissal would not result in substantial \nprejudice to the Defendant, and (2) Defendant's counterclaims cannot remain pending for \nindependent adjudication. (See id at 3-7; see also Rule 41(a)(2)). \nFirst, I find that dismissal of Plaintiffs claims would not result in substantial prejudice to \nthe Defendant. The ANDA suits are at very early stages and the expenses already incurred by the \nDefendant are relatively minimal. See Reach & Assocs., 2004 WL 253487, at *1 (considering \n\"the effort and expense incurred by a defendant in preparing for trial\"). Additionally, while \nDefendant argues that it will be prejudiced by the specter of Plaintiff re-asserting the '226, '143, \nand' 192 patents (see D.I. 28 at 15-20), \"[t]he mere prospect that a defendant will face a subsequent \nlawsuit is not legal prejudice.\" Reach & Assocs., 2004 WL 253487, at* 1. Further, Plaintiff was \ndiligent in moving to dismiss after being notified that Defendant had converted its Paragraph IV \n) \ncertifications to a Section viii statement. See Reach & Assocs., 2004 WL 253487, at \n*1 (considering \"the claimant's diligence in moving to dismiss\"). \nSecond, I find that Defendant's counterclaims \"[cannot] remain pending for independent \nadjudication.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). I find that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction \nover Defendant's counterclaims. \nDefendant argues that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over its counterclaims \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) and the Declaratory Judgment Act. (See D.I. 28 at 9-11). I disagree. \n6 _; \nHaving filed the Section viii statement, Defendant's ANDA no longer \"seek[ s] FDA approval for \nuses of [sacubitril and valsartan] covered by the ['226, '143, and '192] patents[.]\" AstraZeneca \nPharms. LP v. Apotex Corp., 669 F.3d 1370, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also id. at 1374 n.2 (noting \n, ' \nthat some defendants \"originally submitted Paragraph IV certifications ... but later amended their \nANDAs to replace those certifications with Section viii statements\"). Plaintiff can no longer \n\"state a viable\u00a7 271(e)(2) claim\" because \"a patented method of using a drug can only be infringed \n\\ \nunder\u00a7 27l(e)(2) by ... an ANDA that seeks approval to market the drug for that use.\" Id. at \n1379. Therefore, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Defendant's counterclaims \nbecause Plaintiff's infringement claims are now without merit and of no \"actual controversy.\" 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 220l(a). Indeed, Defendant no longer \"remains under the threat of an infringement suit \n... under [\u00a7 271(e)(2)]\" because it converted its Paragraph IV certifications to the Section viii \nstatement. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 482 F.3d 1330, 1341 (Fed. Cir. \n2007). \nIn line with . that conclusion, whether an ANDA applicant relied on a Paragraph IV \ncertification is \"dispositive\" in determining whether-they have a \"justiciable declaratory judgment \ncontroversy.\" Id. at 1344 (\"A justiciable declaratory judgment controversy arises for an ANDA \nfiler when a patentee lists patents in the Orange Book, the ANDA applicant files its ANDA \ncertifying the listed patents under paragraph IV, and the patentee brings an action against the \nsubmitted ANDA on one or more of the patents. The combination of these three circumstances \nis dispositive in establishing an actual declaratory judgment controversy as to all the paragraph IV \ncertified patents .... \"). A Section viii statement \"allows generic manufacturers to limit the scope \nof regulatory approval they seek-and thereby forego Paragraph IV certification and a\u00a7 271(e)(2) \n7 infringement suit-by excluding patented indications from their ANDAs.\" AstraZeneca \nPharms., 669 F.3d at 1379. \nDefendant also argues that it still faces an actual controversy because Plaintiff will not \nconcede non-infringement and may re-file its infringement claims in the future. (See D.I. 28 at \n11-20). I disagree. Defendant's concerns amount to no more than \",subjective or speculative fear \nof future harm\" that cannot justify subject matter jurisdiction. Prasco, 537 F.3d at 1335. \nThus, I find that this Court could not independently adjudicate Defendant's counterclaims \nbecause this Court would not have subject matter jurisdiction. \nHaving found that Defendant would not face substantial prejudice and that Defendant's \ncounterclaims could not be independently adjudicated, I dismiss Plaintiffs claims without \nprejudice under Rule 41(a)(2). Further, having found that this Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction over Defendant's counterclaims, ;I will dismiss these counterclaims under Rule \n,12(b)(l). \nPlaintiff also argues that Defendant's counterclaims should be dismissed under Rule \n)2(b)(6). (See D.I. 24 at 4-7).1 Having found that Defendant's counterclaims should be \ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(l), I need not consider Plaintiffs Rule 12(b)(6) motions. \n1 Plaintiff asserts, \"[T]he Court retains subject matter jurisdiction over [Defendant's] \ncounterclaims\" and, thus, the question of whether the Defendant's counterclaims remain pending \nfor independent adjudication depends on \"whether a Section viii statement warrants dismissal [ of \nDefendant's counterclaims] pursuant to [Rule] 12(b)(6) .... \" (D.I. 31 at 6). I disagree. \nPlaintiffs Rul~ 12(b)(6) motion repeatedly argues that dismissal is warranted because there is no \nlonger an \"Article III controversy.\" (See generally D.I. 24; D.I. 31). This is an argument for \nlack o~jurisdiction. See Ballentine v. US., 486 F.3d 806,814 (2007) (\"Under Article III, Section \n2 of the Constitution, the jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to actual cases or \ncontroversies.\") ( cleaned up); see also id at 810 (\"A motion to dismiss for want of standing is ... \nproperly brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(l), because standing is a jurisdictional matter.\"). Thus, \nI treat Plaintiffs Rule 12(b)(6) motion as a Rule 12(b)(l) motion for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction._ \n8 IV. CONCLUSION \nFor ~he reasons stated above, Plaintiff's motions to dismiss are GRANTED. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n9 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIn re Entresto (SacubitrilNalsartan) Patent \nLitigation \nNOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORP., \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nCRYSTAL PHARMACEUITCAL \n(SUZHOU) CO., LTD., \nDefendant.
