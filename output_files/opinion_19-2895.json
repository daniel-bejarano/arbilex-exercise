Connolly", "date": "04-10-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nIn re: Sensipar (Cinacalcet \nHydrochloride Tablets) Antitrust \nLitigation \nThis Document Relates to: \nAll Direct Purchaser Actions \nAll Indirect Purchaser Actions Master Docket No. 19-md-2895-CFC \nCivil Action No. 19-396-CFC \nCivil Action No. 19-1460-CFC \nCivil Action No. 19-369-CFC \nCivil Action No. 19-1461-CFC \nMEMORANDUM \nThese consolidated multidistrict antitrust actions were originally assigned to \nthe Honorable Leonard P. Stark. In an order filed on March 11, 2022, Judge Stark \ngranted in part and denied in part Defendants' motions to dismiss the second \namended consolidated class action complaints filed by Plaintiffs. See D.I. 251 \n(granting-in-part and denying-in-part C.A. No. 19-md-2895, D.I. 209, D.I. 211, \nD.I. 213; C.A. No. 19-369, D.I. 121, D.I. 123; C.A. No. 19-396, D.I. 148, D.I. 151; \nC.A. No. 19-1460, D.I. 113, D.I. 116; C.A. No. 19-1461, D.I. 101, D.I. 103). \nJudge Stark was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit after issuing the March 2022 order, and the case was reassigned to me. Defendants thereafter filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) for \ncertification of an interlocutory appeal of Judge Stark's order. D.I. 263. \nDefendants asked that I certify the appeal for the following question: \nCan settlement of a patent infringement claim that \ninvolves the forgiveness of damages associated with that \nvery patent's alleged infringement, on its own or \ncombined with an acceleration clause, constitute a \nreverse payment under F.T.C. v. Actavis, 570 U.S. 136 \n(2013) in the absence of some other consideration \ntransferred from the patentee to the alleged infringer? \nD.I. 263 at 1-2. Plaintiffs did not oppose the motion. D.I. 265 at I; D.I. 266 at 1. \nI denied the motion in a memorandum order I issued on February 16, 2023 \n(the February 2023 Memorandum Order) because the plain and unambiguous \nlanguage of\u00a7 1292(b) authorizes only the judge who made the order for which an \ninterlocutory appeal is sought to certify that order for interlocutory appeal. \nD.I. 286 at 3; see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (\"When a district judge, in maldng in a \ncivil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the \nopinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is \nsubstantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the \norder may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so \nstate in writing in such order.\" (emphasis added)). I did not make the March 2022 \norder; Judge Stark did. Accordingly, I concluded that \u00a7 1292(b) does not authorize \nme to certify an interlocutory appeal of his order. \n2 Had I believed I had the authority to certify an interlocutory appeal of Judge \nStark's order, I would have done so, as I believe the question presented in \nDefendants' motion for an interlocutory appeal is a controlling question of law as \nto which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an \nimmediate appeal from Judge Stark's order could very well advance the ultimate \ntermination of this litigation. See Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F .2d 7 4 7, 7 54 \n(3d Cir. 1974) (en bane) (holding that\u00a7 1292(b) \"imposes three criteria\": \"The \norder must (1) involve a controlling question of law, (2) offer substantial ground \nfor difference of opinion as to its correctness, and (3) if appealed immediately \nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \nDefendants have moved for reargument with respect to the February 2023 \nMemorandum Order. D.I. 289. Such \"[a] motion ... should be granted only if the \nmovant can show at least one of the following: (i) an intervening change in \ncontrolling law; (ii) the availability of new evidence not available when the court \nmade its decision; or (iii) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact to prevent \nmanifest injustice.\" Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, 2017 WL \n3888228, at* 1 (D. Del. Sept. 6, 2017). Defendants have not made that showing \nhere, so I will deny the motion for reargument. \n3 I will, however, certify the February 2023 Memorandum Order for \ninterlocutory appeal, as I am \"of the opinion that [the] order involves a controlling \nquestion of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion \nand that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate \ntermination ofth[is] litigation.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). \nThe controlling question of law is: Does \u00a7 1292(b) authorize a district court \njudge to certify for interlocutory appeal an order issued in the same case by a \npredecessor district court judge? Although, for the reasons set forth in the \nFebruary 2023 Memorandum Order, I believe that the plain and unambiguous \nlanguage of \u00a7 1292(b) does not authorize me to certify an interlocutory appeal of \nJudge Stark's order, I recognize that reasonable minds could conclude otherwise. \n(As I noted in the February 2023 Memorandum Order, two courts of appeals have \naccepted without comment district court judges' certifications for interlocutory \nappeal of orders issued by those judges' respective predecessors. See D.I. 286 at 3 \nn.1 ( citing Penthouse Owners Ass 'n, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, \nLondon, 612 F.3d 383,385 (5th Cir. 2010); In re City of Memphis, 293 F.3d 345, \n348 (6th Cir. 2002)).) Thus, there is, in my view, substantial ground for a \ndifference of opinion on the question. Lastly, because \"appellate jurisdiction \napplies to the order certified to the court of appeals\" and \"the appellate court may \naddress any issue fairly included within the certified order,\" Yamaha Motor Corp., \n4 U.S.A. v. Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199,205 (1996) (emphasis in original), an immediate \nappeal of the February 2023 Memorandum Order would, if the Third Circuit \ndisagreed with my reading of\u00a7 1292(b), allow the Third Circuit to consider the \nquestion for which Defendants sought an interlocutory appeal, and therefore , an \nimmediate appeal of the February 2023 Memorandum Order could materially \nadvance the ultimate termination of this litigation . Accordin gly, all three criteria \nof\u00a7 1292(b) are met here. \nDistrict courts have the authority under \u00a7 1292(b) to certify sua sponte \norders for interlocutory appeal. See United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 673 \n(1987); Gen. Pub. Util. v. United States, 745 F.2d 239,240 (3d Cir. 1984). \nTherefore, I will certify the February 2023 Memorandum Order for interlocutory \nappeal. \nThe Court will issue an order consistent with this Memorandum. \nApril 6, 2023 \nF JUDGE \n5 "}
