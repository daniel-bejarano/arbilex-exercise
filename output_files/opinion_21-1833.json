INTRODUCTION\n\nThis is an action for wrongful death and civil rights violations arising from the use of\nforce against Brandon Roberts (\u201cRoberts\u201d). Roberts was fatally shot by Corporal Nigel Golding\n(\u201cCorporal Golding\u201d) and Patrolman Patrick Karpin (\u201cPatrolman Karpin\u201d) of the City of Milford\nPolice Department (\u201cCity of Milford\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), who responded to Roberts\u2019\napartment following his 911 call. (D.I. 1 at \u00a7f 1,27) Defendants filed the pending Motion for\nPartial Dismissal (\u201cMotion\u201d) of the claim for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(\u201cADA\u201d) (Count II) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).2 (DI. 14) Plaintiffs Darlene White (\u201cWhite\u201d) and\n\n' Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1), the parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge\nto conduct all proceedings in this matter through final judgment, and the case was assigned to the\nundersigned judicial officer on April 14, 2022. (D.I. 13)\n\n2 The briefing for the Motion for Partial Dismissal is as follows: Defendants\u2019 Motion and\nopening brief in support thereof (D.I. 14; D.I. 15), Plaintiffs\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 17), and\nDefendants\u2019 reply brief (D.I. 18).\nErica Jones (\u201cJones\u201d) (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) oppose the Motion and, alternatively, seek leave\nto amend the Complaint. (D.I. 17) For the following reasons, Defendants\u2019 Motion for Partial\nDismissal is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART without prejudice, (D.I. 14), and\nPlaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to amend the Complaint is GRANTED. (D.I. 17 at 9)\n\nIl. BACKGROUND?\n\nOn January 5, 2020, Roberts placed a 911 call from his apartment to report a domestic\ndispute. (D.I. 1 at ] 12) During the call, he made incoherent statements before handing the\nphone to his domestic partner, Jones. (Jd. at] 13) Jones resided in the apartment with Roberts\nand their infant child. (Jd. at {] 13, 24). According to the Complaint, Jones did not want to\nprovide their apartment number to the 911 operator because she was concerned that \u201c{Roberts]\nkeeps trying to go out there with a knife.\u201d (/d. at] 16). While Jones spoke with the 911\noperator, Roberts disclosed their apartment address. (Jd. at { 17). He made comments audible to\nthe 911 operator that he possessed a \u201cmachete,\u201d \u201can AK-47,\u201d and a \u201cbomb,\u201d and he claimed an\nassociation with ISIS. (/d. at 18) Roberts was further heard on the 911 call telling Jones that\n\u201che loved her\u201d and that \u201c\u2018y\u2019all are going to have to shoot me, because I\u2019m not going to jail.\u201d (Id.\nat ] 19) Jones informed the operator that there were no weapons in the apartment besides a\n\u201chouse knife.\u201d (/d. at]21) She told the operator that Roberts \u201chas a mental disability so that\u2019s\n\nwhy he\u2019s acting like this.\u201d (Jd. at {22) When Jones observed the police arriving, she again told\n\n3 The facts alleged in the Complaint are assumed to be true for purposes of resolving the partial\nmotion to dismiss them for failure to state a claim. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\nIn resolving the motion, the Court may consider facts alleged in the complaint and its\nattachments, matters of public record, and \u201cdocument[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon in\nthe complaint.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997);\nsee Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir.\n1993).\nthe operator Roberts had a mental disability, and \u201che is bipolar, and he is schizophrenic . . . has\nanxiety and he has a lot of other problems that we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d (Jd. at 23, 25)\n\nCorporal Golding and Patrolman Karpin responded to Roberts\u2019 911 call and approached\nRoberts\u2019 door with their firearms drawn. (/d. at {| 27-28) Corporal Golding knocked on the\napartment door and announced that he was a police officer. (Jd. at ]30) Roberts partially\nopened the door. (Jd. at 931) The Complaint alleges that Corporal Golding had his firearm\ndrawn and pointed at Roberts\u2019 head. (Jd.) Roberts attempted to close the door upon confronting\nthe armed Officer. (/d. at ]32) It is alleged that Corporal Golding escalated the situation by\nforcing the door open. (/d. at 133) Roberts then stepped through the doorway with the knife\npointed toward the ground. (/d. at J] 34-35) While Corporal Golding stepped forward,\nattempting to remove the knife, Patrolman Karpin discharged his firearm and struck Roberts in\nhis upper body. (/d. at f 36-37) Corporal Golding also fired his weapon at Roberts. (/d. at J\n40) Roberts was shot eight times and did not survive. (/d. at {{ 43, 51)\n\nOn December 28, 2021, Darlene White, Roberts\u2019 mother, and Erica Jones, the mother of\ndecedent\u2019s minor children, commenced this action against Defendants, asserting a wrongful\ndeath claim under Delaware law. (/d. at 47) Plaintiffs further assert that Defendants violated\nthe Fourth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by using unreasonable force resulting in\nRoberts\u2019 death (Count I). (id. at 157) Relevant to the pending Motion, Plaintiffs allege that the\nDefendant City of Milford violated Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act (\u201cRA\u201d) by\n\u201cfail[ing] to provide reasonable modifications to its policies and practices to accommodate\nBrandon Roberts\u2019s disability related needs when making contact with him at his home\u201d (Count\nIl). Ud. at] 61) Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Roberts\u2019\n\nmental disability and seek damages in excess of one million dollars. (Jd. at J] 62, 64)\nOn April 18, 2022, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claim in Count II for\nfailure to state a claim for which relief may be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (D.L.\n14) Defendants rely on videotaped evidence of the incident and the investigative report of the\nuse of deadly force prepared by the Delaware Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) in support of their\nargument that there exists no reasonable dispute that the use of force was reasonable and\nnecessary to protect the lives of the Officers and occupants in Roberts\u2019 apartment. (D.I. 15 at 4\u2014\n8) Moreover, Defendants argue there are no facts alleged in the Complaint of any\naccommodation that would have been possible given the exigent circumstances. (/d. at 14) For\nthe reasons which follow, the court grants-in-part Defendants\u2019 Motion for Partial Dismissal of\nthe ADA claim but grants Plaintiffs leave to amend their Complaint.\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint\nand view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Umland v. Planco Fin. Servs.,\nInc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Iqbal,\n\n556 U.S. at 663. A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations allow the court to\ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. See Iqbal,\n556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d Jn re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1420 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). This\n\u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead \u201csimply calls for\nenough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the\nnecessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task requiring the\ncourt \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Igbal, 556 U.S. at 679.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nDefendants\u2019 Motion for Partial Dismissal is limited to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Defendant\nCity of Milford violated the ADA. (D.I. 14 at 8) Defendants argue that the ADA is not\napplicable to encounters with the police involving exigent circumstances such as their encounter\nwith Roberts who was armed with a knife. (/d. at \u00a234; D.I. 15 at 12-15) Additionally, if the\nADA is applicable, then the Complaint fails to sufficiently allege Roberts was subjected to\nintentional discrimination. (D.I. 14 at J] 31-33; D.I. 15 at 15-16) Plaintiffs oppose the Motion\non the basis that they have sufficiently pled an ADA violation and intentional discrimination.\n(DL. 17 at 5-7) The court denies-in-part without prejudice the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Partial\nDismissal to the extent it asks the court for a dispositive ruling at this stage of the proceedings\nthat the ADA does not apply to their encounter with Roberts. The court grants-in-part the\nDefendants\u2019 Motion for Partial Dismissal on the basis that the Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly\n\nplead intentional discrimination.\nA. Plaintiffs Have Sufficiently Pled Roberts was a Qualified Individual with a\nDisability\n\nTo successfully state a claim under Title II of the ADA, the plaintiff must establish that\nthe decedent \u201c(1) [was] a qualified individual; (2) with a disability; (3) who was excluded from\nparticipation in or denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or\nwas subjected to discrimination by any such entity; (4) by reason of his disability.\u201d Haberle v.\nTroxell, 885 F.3d 170, 178 (3d. Cir) (\u201cHaberle P\u201d) (quoting Bowers v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic\nAss\u2019n, 475 F.3d 524, 553 n. 32 (3d Cir. 2007)), remanded to Haberle for Estate of Nixon v.\nBorough of Nazareth, No. 5:15-cv-02804, 2018 WL 4770682, at *4\u20145 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 2, 2018),\nrev'd, Haberle v. Borough of Nazareth, 936 F.3d 138 (3d Cir. 2019) (\u201cHaberle IT\u2019), The same\nstandards govern claims pursuant to Section 504 of the RA.* McDonald v. Commonwealth of\nPa., Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, Polk Ctr., 62 F.3d 92, 94-95 (3d Cir. 1995). Additionally, the Third\nCircuit has held claims for compensatory damages under Section 202 of the ADA also require a\nfinding of \u201cintentional discrimination.\u201d S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist.,\n\n729 F.3d 248, 261 (3d Cir. 2013).\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Third Circuit and this District Court have already determined\nthat the ADA generally applies when a qualified arrestee with a disability has an encounter with\npolice. See Haberle I, 885 F.3d at 179; Glover v. City of Wilmington, 966 F. Supp. 2d 417, 428\u2014\n29 (D. Del. 2013). Haberle J established that an arrestee is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d under the\nADA because \u201cthere is nothing to categorically exclude [him or her] from the statute\u2019s broad\n\ncoverage\u201d and he or she \u201cmay have disabilities covered by the ADA.\u201d 885 F.3d at 179.\n\n4 Because an ADA claim requires the same elements as a claim under the RA, when the term\n\u201cADA\u201d is used throughout this opinion it is intended to incorporate Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the\nRA.\nTherefore, the question before the court is whether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged in the Complaint\nthat Roberts had a disability covered by the ADA.\n\nThe ADA defines \u201cdisability\u201d with respect to an individual as \u201c(A) a physical or mental\nimpairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a\nrecord of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n12102(1).\n\nIn the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Roberts was \u201cexperiencing a mental health crisis.\u201d\n(DI. 1 at 91) Additionally, Plaintiff Jones emphasized on the 911 call that Roberts had \u201ca\nmental disability\u201d and to \u201cplease take it easy on him because he is bipolar, and he is\nschizophrenic. .. . He has anxiety and he has a lot of other problems that we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n(Ud. at <\u00a5 22, 25)\n\nAssuming the truth of the allegations for purposes of the pending Motion, the court finds\nPlaintiffs have plausibly pled that Roberts was regarded as disabled. Cf Mohney v.\nPennsylvania, 809 F. Supp. 2d 384, 401-02 (W.D. Pa. 2011) (finding plaintiff failed to\nsufficiently plead the decedent was regarded as disabled because the responding officer, who\nallegedly discharged his taser at the decedent who had doused himself with gasoline, was not the\nofficer who responded to decedent\u2019s prior suicide attempt and was otherwise unaware of\ndecedent\u2019s mental condition).\n\nUnlike in Mohney, the court finds that Defendants were aware they were responding to a\n911 call concerning a person with a mental disability based upon the statements Roberts and\nJones made to the 911 operator. (See, e.g., D.I. 1 at {] 12, 22, 25, 29) The court finds Plaintiffs\nplausibly pled that Roberts was a qualified individual with a mental disability for purposes of\n\nasserting a claim under the ADA.\nB. Violation of the ADA\n\nDefendants urge the court to determine, as a matter of law, that the ADA is not applicable\nto police officers responding to an incident when they face an exigent threat. (D.I. 14 at \u00a7\u00a5 25-\n34) Defendants contend that Roberts threatened violence on the 911 call, advanced toward the\nresponding Officers in a confined space with a knife, thereby putting in danger the lives of the\nOfficers and the individuals inside the apartment. (See D.I. 15 at 9; D.I. 18 at 6-8 (citing\nallegations in the Complaint)) Defendants argue these facts are \u201cundisputed\u201d and establish that\n\u201creasonable minds could not differ\u201d in concluding that the Defendants had no duty to\naccommodate Roberts\u2019 mental disability under these circumstances. (D.I. 14 at \u00a2 28)\n\nIn Haberle I, the Third Circuit acknowledged the disagreement among the Circuits\n\u201cconcerning the point during a law enforcement encounter at which the ADA applies to police\nconduct [but] no court of appeals has held that the ADA does not apply at all.\u201d 885 F.3d at 181.\nAs an example, the court cited the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in Hainze, which held \u201cthat Title I\ndoes not apply to an officer\u2019s on-the-street responses to reported disturbances or other similar\nincidents . . . prior to the officer\u2019s securing the scene and ensuring that there is no threat to\nhuman life.\u201d Jd. (quoting Hainze v. Richards, 207 F.3d 795, 801 (5th Cir. 2000)). The court did\nnot have occasion to decide the issue in Haberie J, stating in a footnote:\n\nA successful ADA claim demands more than an allegation of an arrest of a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability. The implementing regulations for the ADA make clear that\n\nthere must also have been a failure to make reasonable accommodations. The analysis as\nto what is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the circumstances, including exigent circumstances, and as\nto how their determination is reached, presents complicated issues. We have no occasion\nnow to consider the analytical approach to an ADA claim arising from an arrest because\nwe conclude that [plaintiff's] ADA claim for money damages fails due to her failure to\nplead deliberate indifference. Nevertheless, in the future, we may need to consider\nwhether and under what circumstances it is reasonable to require police officers to make\n\naccommodations during an arrest when they face an exigent threat.\n\nId. at n. 11 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\nAlthough the issue remains unresolved by the Third Circuit, this court agreed with the\nreasoning in Hainze that the ADA does not apply to a police officer\u2019s on-the-street response to a\nreported disturbance prior to securing the scene, regardless of whether the incident involves an\nindividual with a mental disability. Glover, 966 F. Supp. 2d at 429. Defendants argue that\nGlover requires dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claim as a matter of law. (See D.I. 15 at 12-14)\n\nThe court finds Glover distinguishable from the instant case. In Glover, the court did not\nhave to consider whether the ADA was inapplicable to a police officer\u2019s on-the-street response to\na disturbance because those facts were not before it. The plaintiff, who was having a panic\nattack following a car accident, was wrongfully arrested for driving under the influence. Glover,\n966 F. Supp. 2d at 422. Plaintiff claimed that once she was in custody, the police had a duty to\naccommodate her disability, but no accommodation was made or offered to her. Jd. at 429. The\ncourt found the scene was secured before any of the conduct complained of occurred and denied\nsummary judgment, allowing the plaintiff's ADA and RA claims to proceed to trial based on the\ntheories of \u201cwrongful arrest\u201d and \u201creasonable accommodation during arrest.\u201d Jd. at 428-30. See\nalso Sheehan v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1215-16, 1232-33 (9th Cir.\n2014), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, City and Cnty. of San Francisco, Cal. v.\nSheehan, 575 U.S. 600, 608-10 (2015) (denying dismissal on summary judgment of an ADA\nclaim asserted by the plaintiff who was armed with a knife when she was shot by officers who\nwere attempting to take her into custody for an involuntary mental evaluation).\n\nIn their Motion, Defendants improperly attempt to refute allegations in the Complaint by\nintroducing material outside of the Complaint. (D.I. 14 at {J 10-24) Defendants largely rely on\nstill-frame photographs from a video of the incident and related commentary about the Officers\u2019\n\nencounter with Roberts which appear in the DOJ report. (D.I. 15, Ex. 1) They argue the court\nmay consider the evidence without converting the Motion into a summary judgment motion\nbecause it is a matter of public record and is an \u201cundisputedly authentic\u201d document. (D.I. 14 at\n4 10-12)\n\nDefendants\u2019 argument fails for several reasons. First, the court cannot consider materials\nwhich are not mentioned or relied upon in the Complaint. See In re Asbestos Prods. Liab. Litig.\n(No. VI), 822 F.3d 125, 133 n.7 (3d Cir. 2016) (\u201cIn deciding motions under Rule 12(b)(6), courts\nmay consider \u2018document[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint,\u2019 or any\n\u2018undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if\nthe plaintiff's claims are based on the document.\u201d\u201d) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in\noriginal). Nowhere in the Complaint do Plaintiffs mention or rely upon the DOJ report. (See\nDI. 1)\n\nMoreover, the materials are not \u201cundisputedly authentic.\u201d Defendants\u2019 exhibits consist of\nreproductions of still frame photographs taken from unidentified video footage from an\nunverified and unsigned report of investigation with unsworn commentary on what the\nphotographs purport to show. Even if the court were to consider Defendants\u2019 materials and\nconvert the pending Motion to one for summary judgment, the materials do not satisfy the\nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) because they are unverified and raise\nmaterial factual disputes compared to what is alleged in the Complaint.\n\nOn a motion to dismiss, the only issue before the court is the sufficiency of the pleadings,\nnot the merits of the case. The court will not consider Defendants\u2019 unverified material outside of\nthe pleadings. Plaintiffs allege in the Complaint that the Officers failed to communicate with\nRoberts through the door and escalated the situation by forcing the door open with their firearms\n\ndrawn as Roberts attempted to shut it. (D.L. 1 at {] 29, 32-33) Accepting the allegations as true,\n\n10\nDefendants have not provided a basis to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claim in Count II of the\nComplaint. Therefore, Defendants\u2019 Motion for Partial Dismissal is denied-in-part without\nprejudice.\n\nC. Plaintiffs Have Failed to Plead Defendants Intentionally Discriminated against\nRoberts\n\nTo recover compensatory damages related to an ADA claim, Plaintiffs must sufficiently\nplead Defendants intentionally discriminated against Roberts. Intentional discrimination requires\na showing of deliberate indifference. Haberle I, 885 F.3d at 181 (citing S.H. ex rel. Durrell, 729\nF.3d at 263). Plaintiffs can establish deliberate indifference either by \u201cshowing that the\n[Department\u2019s existing policies] failed to adequately respond to a pattern of past occurrences of\ninjuries like the plaintiffs\u201d or by \u201cshowing that the risk of constitutionally cognizable harm was\nso great and so obvious that the risk and the failure of supervisory officials to respond will alone\nsupport finding deliberate indifference.\u201d Haberle II, 936 F.3d at 141 (quoting Beers-Capitol v.\nWhetzel, 256 F.3d 120, 136-37 (3d. Cir. 2001)) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nIn Haberle J, the court found the plaintiff's complaint insufficient because it made\ngeneral and vague allegations concerning the defendant Borough\u2019s history of violating the civil\nrights of its residents. 885 F.3d at 182. The complaint did not adequately allege a pattern of past\nviolations similar to the one at issue in the complaint and could not have put the defendant\nBorough on notice that its policies, practices and procedures had to be changed. Jd. The court\nfound that the plaintiff should be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency by amending the\ncomplaint. Jd. After amendment, the District Court again dismissed the complaint for failure to\nadequately plead intentional discrimination. Haberle for Estate of Nixon, 2018 WL 4770682, at\n*4-5. On the second appeal, the Third Circuit reversed and found that the complaint raised a\n\nplausible claim that the defendant Borough was deliberately indifferent in failing to adopt\n\n11\npolicies accommodating individuals with mental disabilities. Haberle I, 936 F.3d at 142. The\ncourt found that the amended pleading included new facts demonstrating a history of instances of\npolice encounters with mentally disabled individuals resulting in violations similar to what the\nplaintiff experienced. Jd. at 141. The amended complaint also added facts concerning the\ndefendant Borough\u2019s awareness of the history of such instances and their risks, and the defendant\nBorough\u2019s failure to adopt any policy to address them, including a policy that had already been\ndrafted by an Officer in the Borough\u2019s Police Department. Jd. at 142.\n\nPlaintiffs allege Defendants \u201cfaile[{d] to provide reasonable modifications to its policies\nand practices to accommodate Brandon Roberts\u2019s disability related needs when making contact\nwith him at his home.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 961) Plaintiffs further plead that Defendants were deliberately\nindifferent because they \u201chad notice of the need to reasonably accommodate Mr. Roberts\ndisability-related needs and failed to do so.\u201d (Jd. at ] 62) Asa result, Roberts\u2019 \u201csuffered greater\ninjuries than other individuals taken into custody, specifically he was killed.\u201d (Id. at J 63)\n\nPlaintiffs have not plausibly alleged either of the conditions established in Haberle I & I.\nThere is nothing in Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint that indicates a history of encounters between disabled\nindividuals and police that resulted in harm to those individuals similar to the harm suffered by\nRoberts nor facts suggesting Defendant City of Milford was aware of such encounters and their\nrisks but that the Defendant City of Milford failed to adopt a policy to address those risks.\nPlaintiffs have not identified what \u201creasonable modifications\u201d were necessary nor have they\nexplained what \u201cpolicies and practices\u201d require \u201cmodifications.\u201d They discuss in general and\nconclusory terms that the Defendant City of Milford needs to modify its policies and practices\nwithout alleging any descriptive facts. Such conclusory allegations are insufficient on their face\n\nto provide notice to the Defendants of intentional discrimination, and therefore, Defendants\u2019\n\n12\nMotion for Partial Dismissal is granted-in-part. Because the pleading has not been previously\namended and Defendants have failed to show how amendment would be futile, Plaintiffs\u2019 request\nfor leave to amend the Complaint is granted. See Haberle I, 885 F.3d at 182.\nV.
