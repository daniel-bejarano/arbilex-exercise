Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff Sandra Harmon appears  pro se.   She commenced this lawsuit on \nOctober 8, 2021.  She alleges  violations of her constitutional rights pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983  and violations of Delaware law .  (D.I. 2).  Before the Court are  \nDefendants\u2019  motions  to dismiss  and Plaintiff\u2019s  motion for  my recusal.  (D.I. 7, 15, 20).  \nThe matters have been fully briefed.   \nI.  BACKGROUND   \n This is Plaintiff\u2019s third lawsuit concerning the Sheriff\u2019s sale of  her real property \nlocated in the State of Delaware.1    \n On November 7, 2018,  as a result of Plaintiff\u2019s objection, Defendant Delaware \nSuperior Court Judge Richard Stokes  issued a stay of a  Sheri ff\u2019s sale of her private \nproperty , with  the stay to remain in effect until her first two lawsuits, Civ. No. 17 -1817 \n(D. Del.) and 18- 1021- RGA (D. Del) , were adjudicated.2  (D.I. 2 at 2).  On April 22, \n2020, Plaintiff asked Judge Stokes to lift the stay , and he denied the request.  ( Id. at 2).    \n Plaintiff timely objected to the Sheriff\u2019s sale, the stay was not lifted , and Judge \nStokes  and Sussex County Defendants Todd Lawson and Gina Jenn ings moved \nforward and completed the sale without notice  to her  in violation of her right to due \n \n1 I accept Plaintiff\u2019s allegations as true and recite them in the light most favorable to her.  \n2 In Harmon v. Sussex County , Civ. No. 17 -1817- RGA (D. Del.), judgment was entered \nin favor of Defen dants and against Plaintiff on September 12, 2019. Plaintiff appealed, \nand the decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals  on April 8, 2020 .  Harmon v. \nSussex County , No. 19 -3263 (3d C ir. Apr. 8, 2020).   I dismissed the second case,  \nHarmon v. Department of Finance, Civ . No. 18 -1021- RGA (D. Del.) on March 3, 2022.  \n(D.I. 70).  Plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the dismissal is  pending before the Court of Appeals .  \nSee Harmon v. Department of Finance, No. 22 -1556 (3d Cir.).      2 \n process and equal protection, the Delaware Rules of Civil Procedure, and Delaware \nlaw.  ( Id. at 2, 3 ).  Plaintiff filed a lis pendens and it supersedes the cur rent lis pend ens \nfiled in the Sussex County Recorder of Deeds .  (Id. at 3).  Plaintiff seeks declaratory \nrelief, injunctive relief, and $11,000,000 in punitive damages.  ( Id. at 3-4).     \n The Court takes judicial notice that o n January 12, 2018, the Department of \nFinance of Sussex County filed a monition suit against Plaintiff and other s for delinquent \nsewer and water bills and a  demolition lien.   Department of Finance of Sussex County \nv. Harmon Heirs , Civ. A. No. S18T -01-002 ( Del. Super.) at BL- 1.3  Monition was \nentered on January 18, 2018, and posted on the property on January 23, 2018.  Id. at \nBL-6.  On May 30, 2018, a notice of Sheriff\u2019s sale was posted at the physical entrance \nof the property and, on May 31, 2018, Plaintif f and the other property owners were \nnotified by certified mail of a Sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate to take place on June 19, \n2018, at 9:30 a.m.  Id. at BL -16, BL- 17, BL -18.   \n On June 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss and motion for injuncti ve relief \nin the monition suit, alleging violations of her constitutional rights.  Id. at BL -10. On \nJune 18, 2018, the Superior Court denied the motion and ordered that the sale could proceed as scheduled on June 19, 2018.  Id. at BL -28.  The property was sold on June \n19, 2018 to the highest bidder.  Id. at BL -36.  On June 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion \nto invalidate and to dismiss.  Id. at BL -30.  Plaintiff filed an objection to the sale, and \nthen an amended notice of objection.  Id. at BL -35, BL- 44.   \n \n3 The Court has access to the Superior Court docket via Bloomberg Law.  \u201cBL\u201d is how \nBloomberg Law refers to docket entries . 3 \n  On August 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss in the monition suit .  Id. at \nBL-51.  On November 7, 2018, the Superior Court stayed the matt er while awaiting \nresolution of the two related federal civil cases Plaintiff had filed in this Court , that is, \nCiv. No. 17 -1817 -RGA, and Civ. No. 18- 1021 -RGA.  Id . at BL -51.  Plaintiff then filed a \npetition for a writ of mandamus in the Delaware Supreme C ourt to compel the Superior \nCourt judge to dismiss the monition suit .  Id.  at BL -53, BL- 56.  The Delaware Supreme \nCourt dismissed the petition.  Id. at BL -57.  An affidavit of non- redemption was filed on \nJune 19, 2019, and an amended writ filed July 11, 20 19.  Id . at BL -59, BL -60. \n On April 22, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion in the monition suit to lift the stay and \nproceed with a hearing on the notice of objection to the Sheriff\u2019s sale.  Id. at BL -61.  \nOn June 12, 2020, the Superior Court entered an order that denied the motion to lift the \nstay,  observing that there remained a pending federal case and, in both the state and \nfederal actions, Plaintiff argues the monition procedures used were wrong.  Id. at BL -\n67.  The monition case remains stayed.  \n On September 10, 2020, Lefton Harmon, who co -owned the property with \nPlaintiff, filed a  petition for release of his half of the unclaimed \u201cexcess proceeds \u201d from \nthe sale of the property.  See Harmon v. Sheriff of Sussex , at S20M -09-016 (Del. \nSuper. ); (D.I. 9 at 9, 88).  On October 7, 2020, an order was docketed directing the \nSussex County  Prothonotary to release funds in the amount of $44,326.44 plus interest, \nrepresenting half of  the proceeds.  (D.I. 9 at 8, 88).  D isbursement  of the Sheriff \nprocee ds was processed on October 7, 2020 and the file was closed.   (Id.). \n County Defendants Lawson and Jennings move for dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) .  (D.I. 7, 8).  State Judiciary Defendants Judge Stokes and State Court 4 \n Administrator Gayle P. Laf ferty move for dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \n(D.I. 15, 16).   All Defendant move the  Court to abstain under the Younger Abstention \nDoctrine .  (D.I. 7, 8, 15, 16).  Plaintiff opposes.  (D.I. 11, 18).  She also moves for my \nrecusal.  (D.I. 20). \nII. RECUSAL  \n I turn first to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for my recusal.  (D.I. 20).  Plaintiff\u2019s entire \nargument  seek ing my recusal is that the following grounds exist:   \nUnfairness to the Plai ntiff; Personal bias in favor of the Defendants, Failing \nto comply to  the Appellate Court mandate, Abusing standing court \nprocedure with respect to allowing additional evidence outside the scope \nof the Appellate Court Mandate & decision, and his personal interest in the \ncases at issue.   \n \n(Id.).  \n Plaintiff does not indicate under which  statute she seeks my recusal.  \nPresumably , it is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), given that  28 U.S. C. \u00a7 144 r equires  a litigant  to \nfile \u201ca sufficient affidavit that the judge has a personal bias or prejudice against [her].\u201d \nSee Jayasundera v. Macy\u2019s Inc. , 731 F. App\u2019 x 133, 136 (3d Cir. 2018) , and Plaintiff has \nprovided no such affidavit.  \n Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a judge is required to recuse himself \u201c in any \nproceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. \u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n455(a).  The test for recusal under \u00a7 455(a) is whether a \u201creasonable person, with \nknowledge of all the facts, would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably \nbe questioned. \u201d In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd., 368 F.3d 289, 301 (3d Cir. 2004) .  The \nstandard under \u00a7 455(a) is therefore less than \u201cwhether a judge actually harbors bias \nagainst a party .\u201d United States v. Kennedy , 682 F.3d 244, 258 (3d Cir. 2012).  Under \u00a7 5 \n 455(b)(1), a judge is required to recuse himself \u201c[w]here he has a personal bias or \nprejudice concerning a party.\u201d  \n Under either subsection, the bias necessary to require recusal generally \u201cmust \nstem from a sour ce outside of the official proceedings.\u201d  Liteky v. United States , 510 \nU.S. 540, 554 (1994); Selkridge v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co ., 360 F.3d 155, 167 (3d \nCir. 2004) (beliefs or opinions which merit recusal must involve an extrajudicial factor).  Hence, \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality \nmotion.\u201d  Liteky , 510 U.S. at 555.  Similarly, claims of bias or partiality cannot be \nbased on \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, [or] even anger,  that \nare within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having been \nconfirmed as federal judges, sometimes display. \u201d  Id. at 555 \u201356. \n It is evident in reading Plaintiff\u2019s motion that s he is unhappy with rulings I made in  \nher other cases  assigned to me  and her belief that I have been unfair to her .  A \nreasonable, well -informed observer could not believe that my rulings were based on \nimpartiality, bias, or actual prejudice.  After careful and deliberate consideration, I conclude that I have n o actual bias or prejudice towards Plaintiff and that a reasonable, \nwell-informed observer would not question my impartiality.  In light of the foregoing \nstandard, and after considering Plaintiff\u2019s assertions, I conclude that there are no grounds for my recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.   Therefore, the motion will be denied.  \n \n \n \n 6 \n III. MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n A. Legal Standards  \nIn reviewing a motion filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) , the C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to \nplaintiff.  See Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  Because Plaintiff  proceeds \npro se, h er pleading is liberally construed and her  complai nt, \u201chowever inartfully \npleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by \nlawyers.\u201d  Id .  A court may consider the pleadings, public record, orders, exhibits \nattached to the complaint, and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.  \nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).   A Rule  12(b)(6) \nmotion maybe granted only if, accepting the well -pleaded allegations in the complaint  as \ntrue and viewing them in the light most favorable to th e complainant, a court concludes \nthat those allegations \u201c could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief. \u201d  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007).  \n\u201cThough \u2018detailed factual allegations \u2019 are not required, a complaint must do more \nthan simply  provide \u2018labels and conclusions \u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of \na cause of  action. \u2019\u201d  Davis v. Abington Mem \u2019l Hosp ., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).  I am \u201c not required to credit bald assertions or \nlegal  conclusions improperly  alleged in the complaint. \u201d  In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., \nInc. Sec.  Litig., 311  F.3d 198, 216 (3d Cir. 2002).  A complaint may not be dismissed, \nhowever, \u201c for imperfect statement of the legal  theory supporting the claim asserted. \u201d  \nJohnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014).  \n A complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \u201c substantive  7 \n plausibility. \u201d  Id. at 34 7.  That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the \n[complainant] pleads  factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the [accused] is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id.  Deciding \nwhether a claim is plaus ible will be a \u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d  Id. at 679.  \n In deciding motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), courts generally \nconsider only the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, \nmatters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim.  A \ndocument forms the basis of a claim if the document is \u201c integral to or explicitly \nrelied upon in the complaint. \u201d  The purpose of this rule is to avoid the situation \nwhere a plaintiff with a legally deficient claim that is based on a particular \ndocument can avoid dismissal of that claim by failing to attach the relied upon \ndocument.  Further, considering such a document is not unfair to a plaintiff \nbecause, by relying on the document, the plaintiff is on notice that the document \nwill be considered.    \n \nLum v. Bank of Am ., 361 F.3d 217, 222  n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted).  \n B. Discussion  \n  1. Claims against County Defendants    \n The due process and equal protection claims are asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.  County Defendants seek dismissal on the grounds that the Complaint fails to \nallege the personal involvement required to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 (D.I. 8  at 13) , \nand that Plaintiff\u2019s  allegations that the monition case is complete and there was a \ncomplete adjudication of the case fails to state a claim because there has been no \ncomplete adjudication and the case remains stayed  (id. at 11- 12).   \n Plaintiff\u2019s  Complaint fails to state claims and does not meet the pleading \nrequirements of Iqbal and Twomb ly.  The claims are conclusory without sufficient \nfactual allegations  to support the claims.  In particular, there is nothing in Plaintiff\u2019s 8 \n Complaint that makes  it plausible that either of the County Defendants personally \nviolated her constitution rights.  In Plaintiff\u2019s opposition, she makes  additional, unpled \nallegations  to support her claims against County Defendants .  (D.I. 11 at 2) .  Plaintiff \nmay not amend the Complaint through argument in her responsive brief and any new \nfacts provided in her briefing may not be considered by the Court in connection with the motions to dismiss.  See generally Abbott v. Latshaw , 164 F.3d 141, 147- 48 (3d Cir. \n1998).   Therefore, the Court will grant County Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.  (D.I. 7).  \nBecause there is a slight possib ility that Plaintiff may be able to state viable claims \nagainst County Defendants , she will be given leave to amend the claims against them.   \nI do not need to consider County Defendants \u2019 request f or a more definite statement  (D.I. \n8 at 14- 16), even assuming it is properly before me .  \n  2. Judicial Immunity  \n The C omplaint reads like an appeal from Judge Stokes \u2019s handling of the monition \ncase.  If Judge Stokes made some error in the handling of the case, Plaintiff\u2019s remedy is through the Delaware Courts.  Judge Stokes is immune from suit  in this Court, \nthough.  \u201c A judicial officer in the performance of his duties has absolute immunity from \nsuit and will not be liable for his judicial acts. \u201d  Capogrosso v. The Supreme Court of \nNew Jersey,  588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Azubuko v . Royal , 443 F.3d 302, \n303 (3d Cir. 2006)).   \u201cA judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he \ntook was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will \nbe subject to liability only when he has acted \u2018 in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. \u2019\u201d  \nId. (citations omitted).  9 \n  The allegations against Judge Stokes speak to actions taken in his judicial \ncapacity.  Moreover, Plaintiff fails to s et forth any facts that would show that any of the \njudges \u2019 actions were in the absence of jurisdiction.   State Judiciary Defendants\u2019 motion \nto dismiss based upon Judge Stokes judicial immunity will be granted.  \n  3. Quasi -Judicial Immunity  \n State Court Administrator Lafferty has quasi -judicial immunity.   Quasi -judicial \nimmunity prevents Plaintiff  from suing Lafferty  in her individual capacit y for action s \ntaken  within her judicial- related activities.   There is a \u201crecognized immunity enjoyed by .  \n. . quasi[ -]judicial officers.\u201d   Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 460 (3d Cir. 1969) .  \nImmunity from suit applies when:  [t]he official \u2019s action in question involves the exercise \nof discretionary judgment, Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc ., 508 U.S. 429, 435[ -]36 \n(1993), performance of a function under the direction of a judge, Waits v. McGowan , \n516 F.2d 203, 205- 06 (3d Cir. 1975), performance of a ministerial duty pursuant to a \nstatute, see Smith v. Rosenbaum , 460 F.2d 1019, 1020 (3d Cir. 1972), or performance \nof a function otherwise closely allied with the judicial process , Waits v. McGowan , 516 \nF.2d at 206.  \n Lafferty, as the State Court Adminis trator for the Delaware Administrat ive Office \nof the Courts , is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the Chief Justice of the \nDelaware Supreme Court  and assists the Chief Justice in carrying out his constitutional \nresponsibilities as administrative head of all the courts of the State.  See 10 Del. C. \u00a7 \n128(b) and (d).   In addition, court administrators\u2019 duties are an integral part of the \njudicial proc ess and personnel who act on behalf of a judicial officer have quasi -judicial \nimmunity.  See Gallas v. Supreme Court , 211 F.3d 760, 772- 73 (3d Cir. 2000) ; 10 \n Addlespur ger v. Corbett , 461 F. App\u2019x 82, 85 (3d Cir. 2012) . State Judiciary Defendants\u2019 \nmotion to dismiss based upon Lafferty\u2019s quasi -judicial immunity will be granted.     \n  4. Younger Abstention \n All Defendants  move for Younger  abstention and argue that this case implicates \nthe second and third Sprint  categories and directly implicates the on- going state court \naction.   Plaintiff argues that abstention is not appropriate.  \n \u201cYounger abstention is not analyzed under either Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6).\u201d  \nSee Knox v. Union Twp. Bd. of Educ ., 2015 WL 769930, at *5 n.7 (D.N.J. Feb. 23, \n2015).   \u201cDismissal on abstention grounds without retention of jurisdiction is in the \nnature of a di smissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\u201d   Gwynedd Properties, Inc. v. \nLower Gwynedd Twp., 970 F.2d 1195, 1206 n.18 (3d Cir. 1992).  Thus, \u201cmatters \noutside of the pleadings are not to be considered.\u201d   Knox , 2015 WL 769930, at *5 n.7. \nThe Court, however, may  take judicial notice of court documents.   Gwynedd Properties , \n970 F.2d at 1206 n.18  \n Under the Younger abstention doctrine, a federal district court must abstain from \nhearing a federal case which interferes with certain state proceedings.   See Younger v. \nHarris , 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  A Younger  abstention analysis requires courts to first \nanalyze whether the parallel state action falls within one of three \u201c exceptional \u201d \ncategories: (1) ongoing criminal prosecutions, (2) \u201ccertain civil enforcement \nproceedings, \u201d and (3) \u201ccivil proceedings involving certain orders uniquely in furtherance \nof the state courts\u2019 ability to perform their judicial functions.\u201d  Sprint Communications, \nInc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 78 (2013) (cleaned up).  11 \n  Proceedings in state court fall w ithin the third Sprint category when they involve \norders \u201cuniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform their judicial \nfunctions.\u201d  Id.  A monition action is similar to a foreclosure action.   Courts in this \nCircuit have declined to apply Younger  abstention when the underlying state action is a \nforeclosure action, absent a request to enjoin state proceedings , because such an \naction does not fall into any of the three categories.  See Dowell v. Bayview Loan \nServs., LLC , 2017 WL 9486188, at * 10 (M.D. Pa. May 4, 2017).   Accordingly, the \nmotion s for Younger  abstention will be denied.   See Harmon v. Department  of Fin ., \n2021 WL 355152, at *2 \u20133 (D. Del. Feb. 2, 2021), appeal dismissed, 2021 WL 3674121 \n(3d Cir. June 9, 2021), cert. denied , __U.S.__, 142 S. Ct. 300 (2021) . \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the above reasons, the Court will : (1) grant County Defendants\u2019 motion to \ndismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ; (2) grant State Judicial Defendants\u2019 motion \nto dismiss; (3) deny Defendants\u2019 motions for abstention under the Younger Abstention \nDoctrine; (4) give Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint against County \nDefendants Todd Lawson and Gina Jennings; and ( 5) deny Plaintiff\u2019s motion for my \nabstention.  \n A separate order shall issue.  1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nSANDRA HARMON,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      : \n v.     : Civil Action No. 21 -1437 -RGA  \n      : \nADMINISTRATOR TODD LAWSON,  : \net al.,       : \n      : \n  Defendants.    :  \n \n ORDER \nAt Wilmington this  21st day of June , 2022, consistent with the memorandum  \nopinion  issued this date,  \n IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that : \n 1.
