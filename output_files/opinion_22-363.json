(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cBCG\u201d) \nagainst Defendant GameStop Corp. (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cGameStop\u201d), presently pending before the \nCourt is  GameStop \u2019s motion to dismiss (the \u201cMotion\u201d), filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12( b)(6).  (D.I. 43)  For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is GRANTED- IN-\nPART and DENIED -IN-PART . \nI.  BACKGROUND A.  Factual Background \n  Defendant GameStop was o nce a highly profitable company, but by 2019, its  financial \nprospects were in very poor shape.  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 2- 4)  In order to reverse this trend, in that year \nGameStop engaged BCG, a consulting company; BCG was to  evaluate GameStop\u2019s operations \nand develop solutions that would help GameStop  remain viable.  ( Id. at \u00b6 5)  Together, BCG and \nGameStop identified an ambitious target of generating an additional $200 million or more in profit per year going forward\u2014all  as part of a plan to make substantial changes across numerous \naspects of GameStop\u2019s business.  ( Id.)   \n After four months of working together, BCG and GameStop reached a written agreement \nregarding many of the details of BCG\u2019s engagement.  ( Id. at \u00b6 7)  Th is agreement  was titled \n\u201cStatement of Work for BCG Support of GameStop\u2019s profit expansion program\u201d ( the \u201cSOW\u201d) , \nand it was signed on August 20, 2019.  (D.I. 26 ( hereafter, \u201cSOW\u201d) )  The SOW described how \nBCG would provide support to GameStop in connection with at least 10 different identified \u201cworkstreams,\u201d which were spread across a broad range of GameStop\u2019s operations.  (D.I. 28 at \n\u00b6\u00b6 8, 21)  In return, the SOW stated that BCG would be paid either a fixed fee of $16.5 million, \nor an amount of variable fees, whichever was greater.  ( Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 9, 24; SOW at \u00b6\u00b6 2.3, 3.2 )   \n3  Pursuant to the SOW, any v ariable fees owed were to be based on projected profit \nimprovements (as opposed to actual  profit improvements) resulting from  BCG -led initiatives \nrelating to the various  workstream.   (D.I. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 22, 24)  The SOW set out a process by \nwhich the parties were to work together in the future in order to try to agree on what those \nprojected profit improvements  would be .  (Id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 21, 29; SOW at \u00b6  4)  These to -be-agreed -\nupon profit projections would, in turn, relate to four categories of financial improvement areas  \n(or \u201cincentive components\u201d) , three of which are relevant to the instant case:  (1)  \u201cThis Year \n[meaning 2019] Predicted Profit Improvement\u201d or \u201cTYPPI\u201d; (2) \u201cNext Year [meaning 2020] \nPredicted Profit Improvement\u201d or \u201cNYPPI\u201d; and (3) \u201cAnnualized run- rate Pro jected Profit \nImprovement\u201d or \u201cAPPI.\u201d  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6 20; SOW at \u00b6  2.2)  The SOW contains detailed examples  \nand data meant to guide the parties in their discussi ons as to how  projected profit  improvements \nrelating to various BCG initiatives in each workstre am (and, relatedly, to TYPPI, NYPPI and \nAPPI ) could be calculated and agreed upon.  ( See, e.g ., SOW at \u00b6 4.3)  \n The SOW required that the parties would \u201chold regular sessions\u201d to address issues related \nto their work together, including as to \u201cfinancial target and planning coordination.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6 \n4.2.9)  The  parties referred to these sessions as \u201c thermometer m eetings.\u201d  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6 29)  To the \nextent the parties ultimately agreed on projected profit improvements relevant to the \nworkstreams (and in tur n, to TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI), the  SOW required that the  parties r educe \nthose agreements to writing.  ( SOW at \u00b6 4.2.13)  \n Both before and after the SOW was signed, BCG employees and GameStop employees \nworked together under the terms of the SOW.  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6 30)  Indeed, BCG \u201cspent tens of \nthousands of hours working with GameStop across the various workstreams to analyze, develop, 4 and support the implementation of strategies across multiple areas of GameStop\u2019s business to \nincrease profits. \u201d  (Id.)   \n It is undisputed that GameStop paid some portion of the fees that BCG earned due to its \nwork with GameStop.  ( Id. at \u00b6 33)   According to the FAC, these amounts included some \nvariable fees that GameStop had \u201cagreed\u201d that BCG was entitled to \u2014that is, variabl e fees \nrelating to \u201cprojected profit improvements for certain workstreams\u201d that the parties had come to a \u201cspecific agreement\u201d on .  (Id.)\n1    \n Eventually, however, GameStop allegedly began to default on its SOW -related \nobligations in two primary ways .  First, BCG alleges that GameStop breached the SOW by \nfailing to pay it certain variable fees as to which the parties never reached agreement.   According to BCG, relevant to this  category of breaches are the following actions by GameStop:  \n(1) failing to challenge with any \u201c supporting data \u201d (or otherwise failing to \u201cdispute[]\u201d at all) \nBCG\u2019s a ssertio ns as to certain projected profit improvements ; (2) failing to \u201cprovide necessary \ndata, feedback and approvals of projected profit improvements\u201d that would have been ne eded  in \norder to determine the amount of variable fees owed;  and (3) failing to and /or refusing to \u201c even \nattend\u201d the \u201ccontractually -required thermom eter meetings\u201d that would have led to agreement on \ncertain projected profit improvements and additional variable fees owed.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 42(b) -(e))  \nSecond, BCG alleges that GameStop breached the SOW by failing to pay variable fee amounts \nthat it had previously agreed to pay  (i.e., fee amounts as to which GameStop had agreed on the \nunderlying related projected profit improvements).  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 42(a))  As a result of these \n \n1  Although it is not referenced in the FAC, GameStop asserts (and it is not really \ndisputed here) that to date , it has paid BCG at least the $16.5 million in fixed fees referenced in \nthe SOW and approximately $6 million in variable fees owed, for a total of over $22 million.  \n(D.I. 44 at 1 n.1, 5- 6; Tr. at 47)  5 alleged breaches of the SOW, BCG asserts that GameStop owes it approximat ely $30 million in \nvariable fees that should have been paid, but were not.  ( Id. at \u00b6 37)   \nThe SOW is lengthy and ( at least in the Court\u2019s view) somewhat complicated.  The Court \nhas not attempted to summarize all of its contents in this Section .  Nor it is necessary to \nunderstand all of the SOW\u2019s provisions in order to resolve the Motion.  That said, additional \nrelevant facts regarding the SOW or the parties\u2019 history will be set out in Section III below , to \nthe extent relevant  to the Motion.   \nB.  Procedural Background  \nPlaintiff c ommenced this action on M arch 22, 2022, (D.I. 1) ; it filed the operative First \nAmended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) on July 1, 2022, (D.I. 28).  Defendant filed the instant  Motion on \nAugust 15, 2022.  (D.I. 43 )  The Motion was fully briefed as of October 12, 2022.  (D.I. 52)   The \nCourt heard argument on the Motion on March 9, 2023.  (D.I. 75 (herein \u201cTr.\u201d))2    \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n The sufficiency of pleadings for non- fraud claims is governed by Federal Rule  of Civil \nProcedure  8, which requires  \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief[.]\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  If a Rule 12(b)(6) mo vant asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncomplaint fails to plead sufficient facts necessary to set out a plausible claim, then the reviewing \ncourt conducts a two -part analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. \n2009).  First, the court separa tes the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting \u201call of the \ncomplaint\u2019s well- pleaded facts as true, but [disregarding] any legal conclusions.\u201d  Id.  at 210- 11.  \n \n 2  The parties have jointly consented to the Court\u2019s j urisdiction to conduct all \nproceedings in this case, including trial, the entry of final judgment and all post -trial \nproceedings.  (D.I. 11)  \n 6 Second, the court determines \u201cwhether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient  to show \nthat the plaintiff has a \u2018plausible claim for relief.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 679 (2009)).3  In assessing the plausibility of a claim, the court must \u201c \u2018construe the \ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any \nreasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief. \u2019\u201d  Id.  at 210 (quoting \nPhillips v. Cty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)). \nIII.  DISCUSSIO N       \nWith its Motion, GameStop seeks dismissal of both counts of the FAC:  Count I, which \nsets out a claim for breach of contract pursuant to Delaware law, and Count II, which set s out a \nclaim for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under  Delaware law.  \nThe Court  takes up the arguments as to each count in turn. \nA. Breach of Contract (Count I)  \n \nThe Court first assesses GameStop\u2019s arguments as to Count I\u2019s breach of contract claim.  \nPursuant to Delaware law, a plaintiff states  a claim for breach of contract b y plausibly alleging  \nthe following elements:  (1) the existence of a contract , whether express or implied; (2) the \nbreach of an obligation imposed by that contract; and (3) resultant damages to the \nplaintiff.   Pharm. Corp. of Am. v. Askari , C.A. No. 16- 1123- RGA- MPT, 2018 WL 2108200, at \n \n3  In resolving a motion to dismiss, a court typically only considers the allegations in \nthe complaint, the exhibi ts attached thereto, documents or facts that are incorporated by \nreference into the complaint or that are otherwise integral to the complaint\u2019s allegations, matters \nof public record and items for which the court can take judicial notice.  See Siwulec v. J. M. \nAdjustment Servs., LLC , 465 F. App\u2019x 200, 202 (3d Cir. 2012); ING Bank, fsb v. PNC Fin. Servs. \nGrp., Inc ., 629 F. Supp. 2d 351, 354 (D. Del. 2009).  In this Memorandum Opinion, the Court \nhas and will cite freely to the SOW.  Although the SOW is not atta ched to the FAC, it is of \ncourse liberally referenced therein and integral thereto. \n 7 *5 (D. Del. May 7, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 WL 3768988 (D. Del. \nAug. 8, 2018); Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, L.L.C., 971 A.2d 872, 883 (Del. Ch. 2009).4   \nAs the Court noted above, there are two primary ways i n which Plaintiff is claiming that \nGameStop  breached the SOW:  (1) by failing to pay certain variable fees as to which the parties \nnever reached agreement ; and (2) by failing to pay certain variable fees after GameStop had \nagreed to do so.  (Tr. at 48 , 115-17)  The Court will address these two types of breach claims in \nturn below.   \n1.  Failure to Pay Certain Variable Fees as to Which the Parties Never \nReached Agreement  \n \nWith regard to this first type of breach of contract claim, there are four primary  questions \nthat the Court must answer in order to determine whether BCG has stated a claim .   \na. Question #  1:  Was the SOW (at Least as to Its Provisions \nRegarding  Agreement on  Projected Profit Improvements  and \nRelated Payment of Variable Fees  Owed ) a Contract that Is \nIndefinite as to Any of Its Essential or Material Provisions?  \nFirst, the Court must assess what type of contractual obligation is  being asserted here \n(and how that impacts the nature of the Court\u2019s review) .  BCG argues that , when it comes to its \nallegations about GameStop\u2019s failure to pay certain variable fees as to which the parties never \nreached agreement , the Court should examine the allegations  just like it would with any other \n \n4  The proper construction of a contract is purely a question of law, and if a \ncontract\u2019s language is unambiguous, extrinsic evidence may not be used to interpret the intent of \nthe parties, to vary the terms of a contract, or to create an ambiguity.  Exelon Generation Acquisitions, LLC v. Deere & Co., 176 A.3d 1262, 1266-67 (Del. 2017).  Ambiguity is present only when the provisions in controversy are reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.  Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chems. Co. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., 616 A.2d 1192, 1196 (Del. 1992).  A contractual provision is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties in litigation differ as to the proper interpretation.  City Investing Co. Liquidating Tr. v. Continental Cas. Co., 624 A.2d 1191, 1198 (Del. 1993). 8 run-of-the-mill breach of contract claim.  (D.I. 50 at 5- 7; Tr. at 124- 25)  But in the Court\u2019s view, \nthings are a bit more complicated  than that . \nThe issue is that under Delaware\u2019s traditional rule, courts  will not typically enforce a \ncontract that is indefinite  as to any of its material and essential provisions.  Omega Cap. Mgmt. \nPartners, LLC v. Schrage , No. 21- 2924, 2022 WL 17847192, at *2 (3d Cir. Dec. 22, 2022) \n(citing Cox Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. T -Mobile US, Inc ., 273 A.3d 752, 761 (Del. 2022)); Echols v. \nPelullo , 377 F.3d 272, 275 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Hindes v. Wilmington Poetry Soc\u2019y , 138 A.2d \n501, 503 (Del. Ch. 1958)).  In determining whether an enforceable contract existed, a court asks \nwhether the pla intiff has demonstrated that a \u201creasonable negotiator in the position of one \nasserting the existence of a contract would have concluded, in that setting, that the agreement \nreached constituted agreement on all of the terms that the parties themselves regar ded as \nessential  and thus that the agreement concluded the negotiations[.]\u201d  Suppi Const., Inc. v. EC \nDevs. I, LLC , C.A. No. N18L -11-009 AML, 2022 WL 17494807, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Dec. 8, \n2022); see also Loppert v. WindsorTech., Inc ., 865 A .2d 1282, 1285 (Del. Ch. 2004). \nThe problem here for BCG is that \u2014at least  with regard to the SOW\u2019s provisions relat ing \nto how much BCG  was entitled to earn  in variable fees \u2014the contract does not evidence final ity \non all essential terms.  To be sure, as will be  further discussed below, the SOW does include \nmany  agreed -upon provisions that were to be used as a framework  to help  the parties try to reach \nfinal agreement on th is subject .  But even so, the SOW still required the parties to negotiate and \nagree in the future on \u201cbaselines, key assumptions [and] the amounts of the credits to be made to \neach of TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI from the subject initiative(s)\u201d \u2014all so that the  parties  could \nthen agree on \u201cpredictions of the dollar amount of contributions of a proposed initiative or profit \nimprovement leve r to TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI[.]\u201d  (SOW at \u00b6  4.2.13; see also id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 4.1, 9 4.2.9; D.I. 28 at \u00b6  29 (FAC noting that \u201cas required by the SOW, [the parties were to use the \nthermometer meetings to ] agree upon financial baselines for each workstream and the anticipated \nprofit improvement to each workstream, which would determine BCG\u2019s fees\u201d) (emphasis \nomitted); D.I. 44 at 7; D.I. 50 at 7; Tr. at 12- 17)  Only after the parties agreed on those proje cted \nprofit improvement terms would the payment of related variable fees be possible .  (D.I. 52 at 2; \nTr. at 12- 17, 85)  \nThe Court has no trouble concluding on this record that  a reasonable negotiator would \ndeem t hese to -be-agreed -upon contractual terms  as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cm aterial .\u201d  After all, under \nDelaware law, a provision specifying the amount of compensation owed is understood to be one \nof the most important or material aspects of any contract .  See Hindes , 138 A.2d at 503; see also \nEchols , 377 F.3d at  275 (noting that Delaware courts have held that the \u201cgeneral rule is that price \nis an essential ingredient of every contract\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) .  \nAnd here, these key inputs (i.e., regarding certain baselines, assumptions and the amount of projected profit improvements relating to each initiative) had to be first agreed  upon in order fo r \nthe parties to  know how much variable fee compensation BCG would receive, if any.  (Tr. at \n130-31)  That such terms were \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d seems especially clear here , where the \nvariable fees in question would be owed in return for \u201ctens of thousands of hours [that BCG had \nspent] working on this project[.]\u201d  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6  11) \nThis conclusion is supported by a key opi nion of the Delaware Supreme Court that both \nsides cited to frequently in their briefing:  Cox Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. T -Mobile US, Inc ., 273 A.3d \n752 (Del. 2022).  In Cox , plaintiff Cox Communications, Inc. (\u201cCox\u201d) had entered into a \nsettlement agreement with S print Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d) ; at issue in the case was a single term \nfound in the first sentence of Section 9( e) of th at agreement (\u201cSection 9( e)\u201d).  273 A.3d at 755.  10 In order to settle a prior dispute between the parties, Cox had agreed in Section 9( e) that before it \noffered wireless mobile services to its customers, it would enter into a definitive exclusive \nprovider agreement with Sprint.  Id .  To that end, t he first sentence of Section 9( e) read as \nfollows:  \nBefore Cox or one of its Affiliates (the \u201cCox Wireless Affiliate\u201d) [] \nbegins providing Wireless Mobile Service . . ., the Cox Wireless \nAffiliate will enter  into a definitive MVNO agreement with a \nSprint Affiliate  (the \u201cSprint MVNO Affiliate\u201d) identifying the \nSprint MVNO Affiliate as a \u201cPreferred P rovider\u201d of the Wireless \nMobile Service for the Cox Wireless Affiliate, on terms to be mutually agreed upon between the parties for an initial period of 36 months  (the \u201cInitial Term\u201d).    \n \nId. at 756 (emphasis added) .  The next sentence of Section 9(e) defined \u201cPreferred Provider\u201d as \nan exclusive partner with C ox in the MVNO business.  Id . \n After negotiations between Cox and Sprint broke down, a dispute later arose between \nthem about the meaning of this  portion of Section 9(e) \u2014and the degree to which it was \nenforceable under Delaware law.  Id. at 755.  The Delaware Supreme Court, reviewing a \ndecision by the Delaware Court of Chancery, first explained that under the traditional rule in \nDelaware, the absence or indefiniteness of material terms generally renders an agreement \nunenforceable.  Id. at 761.  However, it noted that in SIGA Techs., Inc. v. PharmAthene, Inc ., 67 \nA.3d 330 (Del. 2013), it had recognized that parties could enter into two types of enforceable \npreliminary  agreements.  Id.  \u201cType I agreements \u201d reflect a consensus \u201c\u2018on all the points that \nrequire negotiation\u2019\u201d but indicate the mutual desire to memorialize the pact in a more formal \ndocument.  Id . (citation omitted).  In \u201cType II agreements,\u201d the parties \u201c\u2018agree on certain major \nterms, but leave other terms open for fut ure negotiation.\u2019\u201d  Id . (certain internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  The Cox  Court explained that Type I agreements are fully binding, but 11 that Type II agreements \u201c\u2018do[] not commit the parties to their ultimate contractual objective but \nrather  to the obligation to negotiat e the open issues in good faith.\u2019\u201d  Id . (citation omitted).5 \n The Cox  Court went on to conclude that Section 9(e) was not a Type I agreement or \notherwise a contract including agreement on all material and essential terms.  Id .  This was \nbecause \u201cit leaves a number of terms open, such as price .\u201d  Id . (emphasis added).  T he Cox  Court \nexplained that Section 9(e) expressly contemplated that a future \u201c\u2018definitive\u2019\u201d agreement would \nbe reached as to Sprint\u2019s Preferred Provider status, on terms that would \u201c\u2018be mutually agreed \nupon between the parties.\u2019\u201d  Id . (citation omitted).   \nJust as in Cox  (where the price that Sprint would pay to be a Preferred Provider was left \nunresolved),  here the SOW also left  unsettled the  amount of variable fees that BCG  could earn  \nfrom its engagement with GameStop.  A nd just as in Cox , here the SOW surely contemplated \nthat a fu ture definitive agreement on that subject would need to be reached between the parties.  \n(SOW at \u00b6  4.2.13 (explaining that \u201c[n]o predictions of the dollar amount of contributions of a \nproposed product initiative or profit improvement lever to TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI will be \nmade, and no credits to TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI will be given, unless and until, in each \ninstance, the Parties have completed a sign -off process that culminates in written agreement on \nbaselines, key assumptions, the amounts of the credits t o be made  [] from the subject initiative(s) \nand, as applicable, specific testing and validation procedures applicable to the subject \n \n5  A Type II agreement does not guarantee that the parties will reach agreement on a \nfinal contract because \u201c\u2018 good faith differences in the negotiation of the open issues\u2019\u201d may \npreclude final agreement.  SIGA Techs. , 67 A.3d at 349 n.85.  A  Type II agreement \u201c\u2018does, \nhowever, bar a party from renouncing the deal, abandoning the negotiations, or insisting on \nconditi ons that do not conform to the preliminary agreement.\u2019\u201d  Id . 12 initative(s)\u201d)   Therefore, as to variable fee payment s for which the parties did not come to \nagreement, the SOW does not in clude all  settled \u201c essential \u201d or \u201cmaterial \u201d term s. \nb. Question # 2:  Was the SOW (at Least as to Its Provisions \nRegarding Agreement on Projected Profit Improvements  and \nRelated Payment of Variable Fees  Owed ) a Type II \nPreliminary Agreement , Such that GameStop Had an \nObligation to Negotiate Any Open Issues In Good Faith?6 \n \nBCG  argues that if the Court (as it has above) concludes that this portion of the contract \nshould not be treated as one where all essential terms have been agreed to, then the Court  should \nat least find that the agreement is still enforceable as a Type II preliminary agreement  (hereafter, \n\u201cType II agreement\u201d) .  (D.I. 50 at 8- 9)  Thus, the second key question the Court must answer \nhere is whe ther the SOW\u2019s provisions relating to variable fee payments amount to such a Type II \nagreement.  In arguing that they do, BCG  asserts that GameStop breached \u201c\u2018an express \ncontractual obligation to negotiate in good faith\u2019\u201d over the remaining un- agreed -upon terms.  ( Id. \nat 8 (quoting SIGA Techs. , 67 A.3d at  344))   GameStop disagrees ; it argues  that the SOW can not \nbe read as a Type II agreement .     \nThe Court ultimately sides with BCG  on this point.  In explaining why, it agai n turns \nback to the Cox  decision.   \nThe Cox  Court explained that although Section 9(e)  left \u201ca number of terms open\u201d that \nwere relevant to a future deal to make Sprint a Preferred Provider, the provision was also \u201cnot \ncompletely open- ended[.]\u201d  273 A.3d at 761.  This was because Section 9(e) did include an \n\u201c\u2018agreed framework\u2019\u201d within which the parties could further negotiate  regarding the Preferred \n \n6  As to the Court\u2019s Questions # 1 and # 2, neither party has suggested that it would \nbe inappropriate for the Court to resolve these  legal  issues now , on this record.  Indeed, the \nparties are asking the Court to do so via their arguments as to the instant Motion. 13 Provider  issue.  Id . at 762.  The key aspects of that \u201cagreed framework\u201d were that Section 9(e) \nrequired:  (1) that  \u201cany agreement will identify Sprin t as a \u2018Preferred Partner\u2019\u201d; and (2) that the \nagreement must \u201crun \u2018for an initial period of 36 months .\u2019\u201d  Id . at 761; see also id . at 762 (\u201cIn t his \ncase, the \u2018agreed framework\u2019 is that any MVNO partnership between Cox and Sprint will be \nexclusive for three years.\u201d).  The fact that Cox and Sprint had agreed in these respects was enough for the Cox  Court to conclude that the parties had reached \u201cagr ee[ment] on certain major \nterms \u201d\u2014even though the  parties  had also left \u201cother terms open for future negotiation[.]\u201d   Id. at \n761 (internal quotation marks omitted) .  As a result, Section 9(e) was properly considered a \n\u201cType II preliminary agreement\u201d and \u201cCo x\u2019s only obligation under Section 9(e) [was]  to \nnegotiate open terms in good faith within the bounds of a 36- month exclusive relationship with \nSprint.\u201d  Id . (internal quotation marks omitted).     \nAs in Cox , here the portion of the SOW at issue amounts to a Type II preliminary \nagreement.   Indeed, BCG and GameStop came to agreement in the SOW o n a greater number of \ncomponents of an \u201cagreed framework\u201d for future negotiations than did the parties in Cox .  In \nCox\u2019s Section 9(e),  Cox and Sprint had resolved on ly that  (1) Sprint would hold \u201cPreferred\u201d \nstatus as a cellular service partner and (2) the minimum length of the deal  would be 36 months.  \nThey left all other aspects of the agreement to be hashed out in the future .  Yet here, BCG a nd \nGameStop  agreed o n pages and pages worth of details relating to the process for negotiating \nprojected profit improvements relevant to the payment of variable fees.  Among the se details \nwere that the SOW:  (1) identifies the 10 workstreams relevant to BCG\u2019s consulting efforts (work that would give rise to the ability to earn variable fees), (SOW at \u00b6 \u00b6 1.1, 4.3); (2) notes \nwhat work will be excluded from the scope of the incentive plan, ( id. at \u00b6 1.6); (3) sets a  cap on \nthe amount of variable fees that can be earned  and on the dollar amount of contributions from 14 one of the workstreams , (id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 2.3.1, 4.2.4); (4) provides target  amounts for the variable fees \nearned for each of TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI, ( id. at \u00b6 2.3.2) ; (5) sets a presumptive date by \nwhich variable fee payment amounts are expected to be fully earned, ( id. at \u00b6  3.3); (6) defines \nwhat TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI are meant to capture and how they will be determined, ( id. at \u00b6 \u00b6 \n4.2, 4.2.5, 4.2.6);  and (7) set out very detailed examples of the typical sources of profitability \nimprovement for each of the workstreams, as well as significant detail on how TYPPI, NYPPI \nand APPI will be measured for each of those workstreams, ( id. at \u00b6  4.3).   \nNow, of course, th e SOW did also make clear that there was still work  left to do.  Even \nafter the SOW\u2019s execution \u2014and even with the benefit of all of these guideposts \u2014the parties still \nhad to, inter alia :  (1) identify relevant initiatives in the various workstream s that BC G would \nundertake ; (2) agree on the most appropriate baseline (s) and key assumptions  to be used at the \nonset of each such activity; and (3) agree on relevant predicted profit improvements that would \ncontribute to TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 4.2.7- 4.2.13)   Only after they came to those \nfurther agreements could variable fees be earned.  Nevertheless, the amount and the importance of the  agreed- upon terms relevant to the variable fee calculation process certainly seem sufficient \nto show that th e parties reached \u201c agree[ment] on certain major terms\u201d as to that issue.  Cox , 273 \nA.3d at 761 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nIn asserting that this portion of the SOW does not  amount to a Type II agreement, \nGameStop makes two primary a rguments.  N either are availing.  \nFirst, GameStop a sserts that the above -referenced agreed -upon terms in the SOW \nregarding projected profit  improvements  are simply not the type of \u201cmajor terms\u201d that Cox  \nidentified as necessary to give  form to a Type II agreement.  Id . at 761; see also  (D.I. 52 at 5 \n(distinguishing this case from Cox  on the ground that \u201cthe SOW lacks major terms concerning 15 any future agreement on projected profits\u201d).  But as the Court has set out above, the  number and \nthe importan ce of th ose agreed -upon terms seem just as \u201cmajor,\u201d if not more \u201cmajor,\u201d than the \nrelevant agreed -upon terms in  Cox\u2019s Section 9(e) .  GameStop has not cited  (and the Court has \nnot found) caselaw indicating that agreed -upon terms like these are not \u201cmajor\u201d under the \nmeaning of Cox  and its progeny.  Cf . Greentech Consultancy Co., WLL v. Hilco IP Servs., LLC , \nC.A. No. N20C -07-052 AML CCLD, 2022 WL 1499828, at *12- 13 (Del. Super. Ct. May 11, \n2022) (concluding that a term sheet amounted to a Type II agreement, because it contained \n\u201ccertain major terms\u201d regarding a transaction , such as \u201cthe general terms and conditions\u201d of the \ndeal, but still left open several key conditions relevant to closing, including negotiation and execution of certain transaction documents, receipt of certain approvals from a third party, and receipt of agreemen ts on terms of payments for certain vendors).  And so this argument is not \nwell-taken.  \nSecond, GameStop argues tha t:  (1) in SIGA Techs ., the Delaware Supreme Court \nindicated that a  Type II agreement only exists where  the contract at issue contains an \u201c\u2018 express  \ncontractual obligation to negotiate in good faith[ ;]\u2019\u201d; but (2) the SOW does not contain this type \nof expres s provision.  (D.I. 52 at 3- 5 (quoting SIGA Techs. , 67 A.3d at 344)  (emphasis in \noriginal) )  GameStop \u2019s point is that the SOW does not include  a provision stat ing something like \nthe following:  \u201cThe parties agree to further negotiate in good faith as to th e open issues \nregarding projected profit improvements  regarding all workstreams .\u201d  (Id.)  And it is true \u2014the \nSOW does not use the words \u201cgood faith\u201d in that manner .\n7  But this argument does not win the \nday for GameStop either.  \n \n7  As GameStop points out, the SOW does occasionally use the words \u201cgood faith\u201d  \nin other ways , such as when discussing certain other obligations that the parties have agreed to 16 In part that is because it is not clear to the Court that a Type II agreement must actually \ninclude an express  \u201cgood faith negotiation\u201d provision, in order for the parties to still be bound to \nnegotiate open terms in good faith.  Some Courts, including the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit and the Delaware Superior Court, have read Cox  to stand for the proposition \nthat Section 9(e) did not  contain an express good faith negotiat ion provision, and therefore  that \n\u201cDelaware law does not require  that a Type II agreement include an express contractual promise \nto negotiate in good faith.\u201d  Omega Cap. Mgmt. Partners , 2022 WL 17847192, at *2 n.3 (citing \nCox, 273 A.3d at 761) (emphasis added); see also Greentech Consultancy Co., 2022 WL \n1499828, at *13 (reading Cox  as discussing an agreement that \u201cdid not contain an express \nobligation of good faith\u201d and that instead contained an \u201cimplied obligation to negotiate in good faith[,]\u201d and concluding that nevertheless Cox  \u201crecognized [the agreement at issue] as a Type II \npreliminary agreement\u201d); see also  37celsius Cap.

Obviously, if these courts are correct, and if the parties to an \nenforceable Type II agreement do not need to include an express provision in the agreement that requires future good faith negotiations in order for such an obligation to be binding, then any failure of the SOW to include such an express provision could not result in dismissal of Count I . \n \nundertake.  (D.I. 52 at 5; see also, e.g., SOW at \u00b6 3.3 (noting that the parties will \u201cin their good \nfaith reasonable discretion\u201d jointly determine what amount of money should be withheld in \ncertain circumstances as to the \u201c\u2018Run Rate Target \u2019 incentive\u201d); SOW at \u00b6 4.2.4 (using the term \n\u201cgood faith\u201d to discuss the parties\u2019 obligations as to certain aspects of variable fee discussions relevant to  the \u201cVideo Game Ecosystem, OEM/Publisher Partnerships\u201d workstream) ; SOW  at \u00b6 \n5.4 (noting that the parties will \u201cwork together in good faith\u201d to agree in writing on the impact of any changes to the agreed scope, resources, timelines, or assumptions of the engagement) )   \n 17 But the Court need not resolve that issue here.  That is because even assuming that a \nType II agreement must include express  provisions  requiring the parties to further negotiate open \nterms in good faith, here the SOW di d so.  In the Court\u2019s view, it is possible that parties can \nexpressly agree to negotiate open terms in good faith even if they do not use the words \u201cgood \nfaith\u201d when memorializing that type of requirement.  After all, there are diff erent ways to say the \nsame thing.  (Tr. at 79 -82)  And th e SOW includes just such wording.  For example, in order to \nagree on i mprovements for  a workstream initiative, the parties first needed to determine what \nwere the appropriate baselines to be used  in the calculation process .  To that end, i n Section 4.2.7 \nof the SOW, the  parties \u201c agree[d] to jointly define  the most appropriate baseline to be used at the \nonset of each profit improvement activity\u201d and in Section 4.3 ( as to each of the workstreams  at \nissue ) the parties agreed to \u201cwork together \u201d to develop the baseline from which to calculate \nsavings  or to define a fair assessment of TYPPI, NYPPI and APPI .  (SOW at \u00b6\u00b6 4.2.7, 4.3.2, \n4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.3.5, 4.3.6, 4.3.7, 4.3.8, 4.3.9 (emphasis added) )  Next, Section 4.1 states that , with \ncertain exceptions, the parties \u201cwill agree\u201d on projected profit improvements for each relevant initiative.  ( Id. at \u00b6  4.1)  Section 4.2.9 then requires the parties to \u201chold regular sessions\u201d (i.e., the \nthermometer meetings) to address, inter alia , \u201cfinancial target and planning coordination[.]\u201d  (Id. \nat \u00b6 4.2.9)  And Section 4.2.13 state s that no agreement on projected profit improvements or \ncredits to TY PPI, NYPPI and APPI would  have effect until the parties \u201chave completed a sign -\noff process that culminates in [a] written agreement\u201d on necessary parameters.  ( Id. at \u00b6 4.2.13)   \nThe parties\u2019 agreement that they would \u201cwork together\u201d to and \u201c will agree\u201d on projected profit \nimprovements \u2014and that they would \u201chold regular sessions\u201d to do so in an effort to come to a \n\u201cwritten agreement\u201d on the matter \u2014together amount to an express agreement that they would \nnegotiate in good faith on these points .

Question # 3:  If (at Least as to Its Provisions Regarding \nAgreement on Projected Profit Improvements  and Related \nPayment of Variable Fees  Owed ) the SOW Amounts to a Type \nII Preliminary Agreement, Did BCG Plead Sufficient Facts to Plausibly Allege that GameStop Breached its Duty to Negotiate the Open Issues in Good Faith?  \n 19 The third key question the Court must answer is :  If the SOW\u2019s provisions regarding \nagreement on projected profit improvements and variable fees  owed  amount to a Type II \npreliminary agreement , then has  BCG actually pleaded facts plausibly alleg ing that GameStop \nbreached its duty to negotiate in good faith?    \nGameStop says the answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d  In fact, it argues that any assertion \nthat it breach ed a Type II agreement is a \u201cnew and unpled claim\u201d; in its view, the FAC does not \n\u201callege that any of the SOW provisions listed in [BCG\u2019s brief] contain an obligation to negotiate \nin good faith about profit projections\u201d  or that \u201cGameStop breached those provi sions on that \nbasis.\u201d   (D.I. 52 at 3; see also id . at 4 , 6) \nHere, the Court has some sympathy for GameStop.  It is not as if BCG ever makes \nreference  in the FAC  to a \u201cType II preliminary agreement .\u201d  Nor does the FAC use the term \n\u201cgood faith\u201d in the body of Count I .  And surely B CG\u2019s factual allegations about this type of \nbreach of contract claim could have been more fulsome .  But in the end, the Court concludes that \nthe FAC does just enough to make out a viabl y-pleaded  claim for breach of a Type II agreement.   \nFor one thing, there are  portions of the FAC that read as if BCG is making a \u201cyou failed \nto negotiate in good faith about projected profit improvements\u201d -type of argument.  Those \nportions include at least the following: \n\u2022 In paragraph 29, BCG notes that in the SOW, BCG\u2019s \u201cfees \nwere to be assessed based upon  agreed -upon projected profits \nthat GameStop was anticipated to achieve against agreed -upon \nbaselines [.]\u201d  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6 29 (emphasis omitted) )  It then \nasserts that \u201cGam eStop could not simply disagree with BCG\u2019s \ncalculations to avoid paying fees\u201d and instead \u201chad to present legitimate reasons for any disagreements, supported by relevant data.\u201d  ( Id.)  In paragraph 35, BCG goes on to allege that \nGameStop \u201c never provided any supporting data from which to \nrefute [BCG\u2019s] projected profit improvements\u201d and has \u201csimply demanded reductions without any data or analysis to 20 support them[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6  35)  This, BCG alleges, violates the \nSOW\u2019s requirements that \u201cGameStop cooperate i n good faith \nto timely approve goals and projections.\u201d  ( Id. (emphasis \nadded))8  Similar allegations are also repeated in the body of \nCount I itself.  ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 42(b) -(d))  The Court reads these \nportions  of the FAC as asserting that, pursuant to the SOW,  \nGameStop could not simply disagree with BCG\u2019s views about \nprojected profits without making a good faith attempt to \nnegotiate in response to that vie w, or without providing a good \nfaith explanation as to why  it disagreed.  BCG is alleging that, \nin order to meet its obligation to negotiate in good faith , \nGameStop at least had to provide \u201creasons\u201d or  \u201cdata\u201d or some \nother feedback explaining why it had a contrary view  about \ncertain profit projection numbers .  And it is suggesting that \nGameStop did not do so.  (D.I. 50 at 10 n.3 ( BCG explaining \nthat it s allegation here is that GameStop could not \u201csimply \nstonewall BCG\u201d))9 \n \n \n8  In this portion of paragraph 35, BCG cites for support to Section 1.3 of the \u201cBCG \nStandard Terms\u201d (\u201cStandard Terms\u201d) document,  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6  35), which is appended to the end \nof the SOW , (SOW  at Standard Terms at \u00b6  1.3).  The Court has reviewed Section  1.3 of the \nStandard Terms  and has discussed it with the partie s.  (Tr. at 136 -42, 170)  Candidly, the Court \ndoes not see how this section relates t o the negotiation process regarding projected profit \nimprovements or variable fees owed.  Instead , the section seems to be discussing how GameStop \nhas agreed to cooperate  with BCG regarding the delivery of BCG\u2019s consulting services \u2014such as \nhow GameStop will provide BCG with access to certain data or materials or services,  so that the \nBCG consultants who are trying to perform work on agreed -upon initiatives  can do their job.  \n(SOW at Standard Terms at \u00b6  1.3; see also  D.I. 44 at 12; Tr. at 140- 41)  Yet even though Section \n1.3 of the Standard Terms does not appear to be about the duty to negotiate over projected profit improvements/ variable fees in good faith, the remainder of paragraph 35 is  pretty clearly \nreferring to that type of a duty\u2014a duty that is  described i n other sections of the SOW. \n \n9  In one  portion of its opening brief, GameStop seemed to read these allegations \ndifferen tly\u2014i.e., that BCG was alleging that GameStop had breached the SOW because \nGameStop failed to agree  on certain projected profit improvements with BCG.  ( D.I. 44 at 7- 8)  \nHowever, that is clearly  not the allegation that BCG is  making here.  BCG  does not  claim that \nthe SOW required that the parties  actually had to end up agreeing on certain variable fee- related \nprofit projections.  BCG  knows that the SOW allowed for the possibility that the parties would \nnot agree  on that score.  Instead, BCG  is faulting GameStop for failing to sufficiently go through \nthe process of attempting to obtain that agreement in good faith.  (D.I. 50 at 9 (\u201c[T] he SOW \nclearly does not confer GameStop with the discretion to simply deny BCG\u2019s variable fees at will.  To the contrary, the SOW states that the parties are to \u2018work together\u2019 to determine profit improvements . . . and \u2018to define a fair assessment of the TYPPI, NYPPI an d APPI. \u2019\u201d)) 21 \u2022 In paragraph 36, BCG asserts that GameStop also \u201crefused to \nattend Thermometer Meetings, despite the fact that such meetings are mandatory under the SOW\u201d and that GameStop\u2019s  \n\u201ccancellation of these meetings prevented the parties from engaging in discussions to confirm fees owed to BCG.\u201d  ( D.I. \n28 at \u00b6  36; see also id . at \u00b6 14)  This allegation is repeated in \nthe body of Count I as well.  ( Id. at \u00b6  42(e)  (alleging that \nGameStop \u201cfail[ed] and refus[ed] to even attend contractually -\nrequired thermometer meetings to validate projected profit improvements and BCG\u2019s fees \u201d))  Surely th ese are portions of \nthe FAC where BCG i s faulting GameStop for failing to \nengage in good faith negotiations over variable fees.  If \nGameStop refused to attend the very meetings at which the parties were supposed to negotiate over projected profit improvements, how could the parties  ever  reach g ood faith \nagreement on that subject?  \n \nAdditionally, there are portions of the FAC in which BCG  references  the very contractual \nprovisions  (discussed above)  that give rise to GameStop\u2019s duty to negotiate in good faith.  In \nparagraph 27 of the FAC , BCG cites  to the SOW\u2019s Section 4.3\u2014the section in which the parties \nagree to \u201cwork together \u201d to develop key assumptions that will guide agreement on projected \nprofit improvements for the various workstreams.  ( Id. at \u00b6  27)  And i n paragraph 29, BCG \nreferences Section 4.2.9\u2019s requirement that t he parties must  \u201chold regular sessions\u201d to address, \ninter alia , \u201c\u2018financial target and planning coordination[.] \u2019\u201d  (Id. at \u00b6  29 (citation omitted) )   \nThis all indicates that there is enough factual detail in the  FAC to provide reasonable \nnotice of the claim  for breach of a Type II agreement.   Again, a s noted above, the FAC asserts \nthat GameStop \u201cnever provided any supporting data from which to refute [BCG\u2019s] projected \nprofit improvements\u201d and has \u201csimply demanded reductions without any data or analysis to \nsupport them[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6  35)  And it alleges that GameStop \u201crefused to attend Thermometer \nMeetings\u201d and \u201c cancell[ed]\u201d such meetings.  ( Id. at \u00b6  36)  Now, it is surely true that  the FAC \ncould have included more factual detail about these alleged breaches .  That is, the FAC could 22 have included reference to the dates on which t hese projected profit improvement proposals  or \ndemands for reductions were made , or the dates on which the  relevant thermometer meeting s \nwere cancelled.  And it could have named t he people who proposed those  relevant profit \nimprovements, or who demanded the  reductions, or who cancelled the  meetings.  But Rule 8 \napplies to these allegations, not Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 9(b).  See Eastman Chem. Co. v. \nAlphaPet Inc ., Civ. Action No. 09- 971-LPS-CJB, 2011 WL 5402767, at *11 (D. Del. Nov. 4, \n2011)  (\u201cDefendants again seek to impose a heightened pleading burden on Plaintiff, which is at \nodds with the less strin gent requirements of Rule 8.\u201d) ; see also  (Tr. at 97).   And although they \nare a bit sparse  at times , it is not as if the  above -referenced allegations are entirely devoid of \nrecognizable factual underpinnings .  The y let GameStop know what types of acts are said to give \nrise to breach.  And those alleged breaching acts  (such as the c ancellation of specific types of \nmeetings) do not seem to have been so ubiquitous as to leave GameStop in the dark about what is \nbeing referenced.   Cf. Renco Grp., Inc. v . MacAndrews AMG Holdings LLC , C.A. No. 7668-\nVCN, 2015 WL 394011, at *6 (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2015). \nTherefore, t he Court concludes that BCG has pleaded sufficient factual matter to allege a \nplausible claim for breach of a Type II agreement.  \nd. Question # 4:  Has BCG Sufficiently Alleged Damages Relating \nto GameStop \u2019s Alleged Breach  of the Type II Agreement ? \n \nThe fourth key question the Court must answer is whether, as to its claim for a breach of \na Type II agreement, BCG has sufficiently alleged resultant damages .  In SIGA Techs ., the \nDelaware Supreme Court explained that where parties have a Type II preliminary agreement to \nnegotiate in good faith, the plaintiff can recover reliance damages or, if there is a finding that the 23 parties \u201cwould have reached agreement but for the defendant\u2019s  bad faith negotiations [,]\u201d the \nplaintiff can recover expectation damages.   SIGA Techs. , 67 A.3d at 350- 51. \nGameStop argues that \u2014at least with regard to the allegations that it refused to attend or \ncancelled thermometer meetings \u2014BCG has failed to ple ad a plausible claim to expectation \ndamages .  (D.I. 44 at 13)10  That is assertedly  because \u201cBCG fails to allege facts showing \nplausibly that, but for GameStop\u2019s purported cancellations, the parties would have agreed  on \u2018the \nanticipated profit improvement[ s] . . . which would determine BCG\u2019s [variable] fees.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. \n(quoting D.I. 28 at \u00b6  29) (emphasis added) ; see also  D.I. 28 at \u00b6  43 (BCG alleging in Count I that \n\u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of GameStop\u2019s failure to perform its obligations under the \nSOW, BCG has been damaged \u201d to the tune of $30 million))   \nThe Court reject s this argument.  A plausible claim is all that is needed here, and there \nare allegations in the FAC that surely meet this bar.  T he text of the SOW itsel f and the FAC\u2019s \nallegations about the parties\u2019 history together is evidence that further good faith negotiations might plausibly have led to agreement on additional projected profit improvements ( and related \nvariable fee payment s).  The FAC alleges that BCG and GameStop had numerous discussions  \nover a fourth -month period in 2019; these negotiations are alleged to have been \u201c grounded in \ngood faith\u201d and resulted in the SOW.  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6  7, 12)  As a result of those negotiations, the  \nSOW include d vari ous detailed terms  providing a framework for further negotiations about \n \n10  In its opening brief GameStop also asserted that , to the extent that the FAC \nalleges a breach of contract based on it having made late payments  to BCG , the FAC also failed \nto plausibly assert damages flowing from any such breach.  (D.I. 44 at 14- 15)  But in its \nanswering brief, BCG confirmed that it is not asserting breach of contract as to a ny purportedly \nlate payments made by GameStop.  (D.I. 50 at 16 n.5)  So the Court need not examine that issue \nany further.  \n 24 projected profit impro vements .  If the parties were able to reach agreement on all of those many \ndetails by negotiating in good faith throughout 2019, then it seems at least plausible11 that (had \nGameStop not cancelled future thermometer meetings ) they  might also have reached  agreement \non additional projected profit improvement figures  thereafter .  (Tr. at 157)  \ne. Conclusion \n \nFor the reasons set out above, BCG has plausibly alleged a breach of contract claim \nregarding breach of a Type II preliminary agreement.  This type of claim is viable in Count I and \ncan move forward.  \n2.  Failure to Pay Variable Fees After Agreement Had Been Reached  \nThe Court now turns to the second type of alleged breach of contract  that BCG  presses in  \nCount I:  GameStop\u2019s alleged failure to pay certain variable fees after agreement on those fees had been reached.\n12  Here though, and even giving BCG every benefit of the doubt, the Court \n \n11  During oral argument, GameStop\u2019s counsel argued that the damages -related \nallegations here were insufficient because it was \u201c very possible  that the parties could have \nnegotiated in good faith [had they actually held the above- referenced thermometer meetings] and \nnever reached an agreement, in which case there would be no damages for [GameStop\u2019s] failure \nto attend meetings.\u201d  (Tr. at 103-04 ( emphasis added) )  But of course, BCG need only make \nplausible  allegations in its FAC; that other \u201cpossible\u201d inferences can be drawn from the facts \nalleged does not make the allegations implausible.  \n \n12  The parties appear to agree that even if the SOW contains a Type II agreement as \nto the duty to negotiate in good faith over predicted profit improvements and the payment of variable fees, the SOW may still include other provisions, independent of that duty, that can be enforced via a breach of contract claim .  (D.I. 52 at 1 (GameStop asserting that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t \nchallenge the SOW\u2019s enforceability\u201d and instead only \u201cchallenges any claim that GameStop was required to reach an agreement with BCG on \u2018projected profits that GameStop was anticipated to achieve\u2019\u201d) ; Tr. at 67-72 (GameStop\u2019s counsel noting that \u201cto the extent there is any [T]ype [II] \nagreement, it would be an agreement to agree on predicted profit improvements\u201d as the \u201cproper way to look at the contract is not to say that the entire contract is an agreem ent to agree\u201d and that \n\u201cif the [SOW] contains multiple obligations, all of these are enforceable\u201d) )  The Court assumes \nwithout deciding that this is so. \n 25 concludes that there are just simply not enough facts pleaded to give GameStop fair notice of this \ntype of claim.  \nIn part , this is because the relevant allegations of breach are made in only one sentence, \nwhich is essentially repeated three times  in the FAC.  In paragraph 13, for example, BCG claims \nthat \u201c [i]n many cases, GameStop has refused to pay BCG\u2019s fees even after agreeing to the \nprojected profit improvements.\u201d  ( D.I. 28 at \u00b6 13)  In paragraph 33, BCG again similarly asserts \nthat \u201cGameStop has  failed to pay all fees due and owing, however, even despite their specific \nagreement as to the underlying pr ojected profit  improvements for certain workstreams.\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6  \n33)  And then in the body of Count I, BCG states that GameStop  breached the SOW by \u201cfailing \nto pay BCG\u2019s fees, even for work that resulted in projected profit improvements that the parties have expressly agreed upon[.]\u201d  ( Id. at \u00b6  42(a))   This is the sum total of BCG\u2019s allegations  on this \npoint . \nThis one basic type of assertion , which amounts to little more than \u201cYou failed to pay me \nfees that you agreed to pay ,\u201d is so devoid of any meaningful factual conten t that it fails to \nprovide GameStop with even a basic understanding of the alleged wrong.  As GameStop notes, \u201cBCG never identifies which workstreams were involved, what was purportedly agreed to or how, or any other facts providing fair notice of the basis for this claim. \u201d  (D.I. 44 at 9- 10; see \nalso Tr. at 101)  And that is surely true.  But even putting that aside , the FAC additionally fails to \nlet GameStop  know if th ese allegation s relate to written or oral \u201cagreement[s]\u201d to pa y.  During \noral argument, the Court asked this question of B CG\u2019s counsel, who responded that the FAC \nmeans to allege \u201cboth\u201d:  i.e., that in \u201csome cases it\u2019s oral agreements at meetings that were never \nfollowed up on and paid and some other cases I think there are sign off sheets that are signed \nwith a signature with GameStop on them that we never received payment for.\u201d  (Tr. at 163- 64; 26 see also  Tr. at 101)  Whether the purported agreements at issue were written or oral may well \nmake a big difference as to w hether GameStop can be legally bound.  ( See SOW at \u00b6  4.2.13)  Yet \nGameStop would have no basis to know  whether oral or written promises are at issue here (or \nanything else about the substance of the alleged promises) from simply reading the FAC.  (D.I. \n52 at 8)   \nUnder these circumstances, the Court concludes that Count I does not sufficiently plead a \nclaim for breach of contract  as to agreed -upon variable fees owed.  See , e.g., Arma v. \nBuyseasons, Inc., 591 F. Supp. 2d 637, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (\u201cThe bare allegations that Defendants \u2018failed to make timely payments\u2019 and \u2018failed to properly account\u2019 to Plaintiffs . . . are, without more, conclusory.  They are unsupported by any specific facts indicating what particular payments were late, when they were due and made, how such late payments give rise to a claim . . ., or how such a claim translates into damages.\u201d) ; iCARD Stored Value Sols., L.L.C. \nv. West Suburban Bank , No. 4:07- CV-1539 CAS, 2008 WL 619236, at *2 (E.D. M o.

Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count II)  \n \nLastly, t he Court assesses GameStop\u2019s arguments as to Count II\u2019s claim for a breach of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   \n\u201cThe covenant [of good faith and fair dealing] is best understood as a way of implying \nterms in [a contractual]  agreement, whether employed to analyze unanticipated developments or \nto fill gaps in the contract\u2019s provisions.\u201d  Dunlap v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 878 A.2d 434, 27 441 (Del. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \u201cStated in i ts most general \nterms, the implied covenant requires a party in a contractual relationship to refrain from arbitrary \nor unreasonable conduct that has the eff ect of preventing the other party to the contract from \nreceiving the fruits of the bargain.\u201d  Id. at 442 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nThe elements of a claim for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are that there be \u201ca specific implied contractual obligation, a breach of that obligation by the \ndefendant, and resulting damage to the plaintiff.\u201d  Jeter v. RevolutionWear, Inc., C.A. No. 11706- VCG, 2016 WL 3947951, at *6 (Del. Ch. July 19, 2016) (internal quot ation marks and \ncitations omitted) ; see also Kyle v. Apollomax, LLC , 987 F. Supp. 2d 519, 527 (D. Del. 2013) .  \nParties are liable for breaching the covenant when \u201ctheir conduct frustrates the \u2018overarching purpose\u2019 of the contract by taking advantage of the ir position to control implementation of the \nagreement\u2019s terms.\u201d  Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (citation omitted).  \nApplying the covenant , however, \u201cinvolves a cautious enterprise,\u201d in which one \n\u201cgenerally cannot base a claim for breach . . . on conduct authoriz ed by [an] agreement.\u201d  Nemec \nv. Shrader , 991 A.2d 1120, 1125- 26 (Del. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nTo be sure, the Delaware Supreme Court \u201chas recognized \u2018the occasional necessity\u2019 of implying contract terms to ensure the parties\u2019 \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 are fulfilled.\u201d  Dunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (citation omitted).  \u201cThis quasi -reformation, however, \u2018should be [a] rare and fact -\nintensive\u2019 exercise, governed solely by \u2018issues of compelling fairness [,]\u2019\u201d i d. (citation omitted) , \nand one that is only \u201crarely invoked successfully[,]\u201d Kuroda, 971 A.2d at  888.  For example, the \n\u201cimplied covenant will not infer language that contradicts a clear exercise of an express \ncontractual right.\u201d  Nemec, 991 A.2d at 1127.  And \u201c[o]nly when it is clear from the writing that \nthe contracting parties \u2018would have agreed to proscribe the act later complained of  . . . had they 28 thought to negotiate with respect to that matter\u2019 may a party invoke the covenant\u2019s protections.\u201d  \nDunlap, 878 A.2d at 442 (citat ion omitted).  \nIn Count II, BCG is asserting that when GameStop failed to negotiate in good faith over \nthe payment of variable fees, that failure amounted to a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing .\n13  In other words, Count II assert s that the SOW does not contain any \nprovisions prohibit ing GameStop from engaging in a bad faith failure to negotiate projected \nprofit improvements and future variable fees  owed .  But as set forth above, the parties did \nanticipate that this type of  good fa ith provision was needed in the SOW.  And the SOW did give \nBCG the \u201cexpress contractual right\u201d to require GameStop to engage in such good faith negotiations.  This all indicates that the SOW clearly covers the type of conduct that is addressed in Count II.  (D.I. 50 at 17 (BCG noting that it does \u201cnot necessarily disagree\u201d that the SOW contains provisions relating to what is alleged in Count II and that, i f so, \u201cenforcement of an \nimplied covenant is unnecessary\u201d))\n14  In such cases, where it cannot be plausi bly alleged that \nthere is any gap to fill in the contract via the purportedly implied contractual terms, dismissal of \n \n13  More particularly, BCG alleges that GameStop was guilty of such a breach by \n\u201cfailing to participate  in Thermom eter Meetings in good faith (and in some cases, at all), refusing \nto finalize in good faith the projected achievement rate to TYPPI, NYPPI, and APPI resulting \nfrom BCG\u2019s services under the SOW, raising spurious defenses to payment, and demanding unsupported deductions from the agreed- upon metrics upon which BCG\u2019s fees were based in \norder to hold payment of BCG[\u2019]s fees in limbo and prevent final resolution of the project[.]\u201d  (D.I. 28 at \u00b6  46)   \n \n14  The Court acknowledges that a party may plead in the alternative in federal court.  \n(D.I. 50 at 17); see Williams v. Progressive Direct Ins. Co., Civil Action No. 22- 510-MAK,  2022 \nWL 4482726, at *10 (D. Del. Sept. 27, 2022) .  But such \u201cin the alternative\u201d allegations must still \nat least be plausible.   Juju, Inc. v. Native Media, LLC , Civil Action No. 19- 402-CFC, 2020 WL \n3208800, at *6 n.3 (D. Del. June 15, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 4001059 (D. Del. Jul. 15, 2020).  And f or the reasons set out above, BCG\u2019s claim in Count II is  \nnot. 29 this type of claim is appropriate .  See, e.g., Truinject Corp. v. Nestle Skin Health, S.A., C.A. No. \n19-592-LPS-JLH, 2020 WL 70981, at *15- 16 (D. Del. Jan. 7, 2020)  (dismissing claims for \nalleged breaches of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Delaware law, \nwhere the contract clearly addressed the issues said to give rise to  the asserted breaches of the \ncovenant) ; cf. Buck v. Viking Holding Mgmt. Co. LLC , C.A. No. N20C -08-249-AML (CCLD), \n2021 WL 673459, at *5 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 22, 2021) (same) .   \nIV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the  Court  concludes  that Defendant \u2019s Motion should be \nGRANTED- IN-PART and DENIED -IN-PART .  More specifically, the Motion is DENIED as to \nCount I\u2019s allegation of breach of contract as to a Type II preliminary agreement contained in the SOW.  The Motion is  GRANTED as to Count I in all other respects and also as to Count II.   \nBCG sought the opportunity to further amend the FAC if any portion of the Motion were \nsuccessful.  (D.I. 50 at 18)  The Court does not see how BCG could plead a claim as to Count II in light of the analysis set out above, and so it appears that any further  attempt to do so would be \nfutile.  But as to BCG\u2019s attempted claim in Count I for , inter alia , breach of contract due to the \nfailure to pay agreed -upon variable fees owed, BCG  may be able to further state such a claim.  \nTherefore, and because amendment should be permitted freely \u201cwhen justice so requires[,]\u201d Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), BCG will be permitted an opportunity to file a further amended complaint  to \naddress this type of claim  by no later than 14 days from today\u2019s date.  \nAn appropriate Order will is sue. \n \n "}
