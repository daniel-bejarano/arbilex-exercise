GRACE & CO., et al., \nReorganized Debtors. \nGARY SMOLKER , \nAppellant , \nV. \nW.R. GRACE & CO., et al., \nAppellees . Chapter 11 \nBankr. Case No. 01-01139-AMC \nCiv. No. 21-987-LPS \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \n1. Pending before the Court is Appellee's motion to dismiss (D.I. 4) (\"Motion to \nDismiss\") the appeal filed by pro se appellant Gary Smolker (\"Appellant \") from the Bankruptcy \nCourt's June 22, 2021 order cancelling a hearing (Bankr. D.I. 33236)1 (\"Order Cancelling \nHearing\"). Appellee has filed an opposition to the relief sought in the Motion to Dismiss. (D.I. 6, \n7, 8) For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the Motion to Dismiss. \n2. Background. On March 15, 2021, Appellant filed a request (App. Ex. 2)2 \n(\"Sanctions Hearing Request\") that the Bankruptc y Court set a hearing date for a sanctions motion \nthat Appellant stated he intended to file once he had filed a motion to compel Appellee to produce \ndocuments. Appellant first raised the issue of filing a motion for sanctions in September 2020, \n1 The docket of the chapter 11 case, captioned In re W R. Grace & Co., et al., No. 01-1139 (AMC) \n(Bankr. D. Del.), is cited herein as \"Bankr. D.I. _.\" \n2 The appendix (D.I. 5) to the Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 4) is cited herein as \"App. Ex._.\" during a hearing in which the Bankruptcy Court set a briefing schedule for Appellee's then-pending \nsummary judgment motion requesting disallowance of Appellant 's bankruptcy claim:3 \nMR. SMOLKER: I'd like you to calendar a separate motion for sanctions , which I \nintend to file, and I would like to have a filing deadline of 30 days after my filing \ndeadline for my response to summary judgment , which would be January 15th. \nTHE COURT: Just so I understand , what is the basis of the motion for sanctions and \nwho is it against? \nMR. SMOLKER: It's against Grace and its attorneys for perpetuating a fraud on the \nCourt. \nTHE COURT: Okay. What would that fraud be, just so I understand? \nMR. SMOLKER : Misrepresenting to the Court the facts and the law on which prior \norders were made and also in its current motion. They've left out critical facts that \nyou should know in order to make the right decision .... \n(App. Exh. 13, 9/17/2020 Hr'g Tr. at 12:12-13:1) \n3. In his Sanctions Hearing Request, which was ultimately filed on March 15, 2021, \nAppellant stated that he would be filing a sanctions motion against counsel representing Appellee in \ncertain California state court litigation, which was the subject of the claim disallowance summary \njudgment proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court, as well as in the summary judgment matter \nitself, demanding that each of four named attorneys pay \"compensation to Gary S. Smolker in the \namount of $3,000,000.00 as sanctions as a consequence of their wrongful conduct.\" (Sanctions \nHearing Request at 1) Appellant requested that the Bankruptcy Court set the hearing: \nat least 30 days after the Court hears and decides SMOLKER'S Motion for Court \nOrder Compelling GRACE to Produce Documents. SMOLKER further requests that \nthe court not set a hearing date prior to 60 days after the date the court gives notice \nof the hearing date for ... [Mr. Smolker's putative sanctions motion] \nSMOLKER will be filing a motion seeking an order ordering GRACE to produce \ndocuments shortly. \n3 On March 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order disallowing Appellant's bankruptcy \nclaim. (Bankr. D.I. 33217). That order is the subject of a separate appeal. See Smolker v. W R. \nGrace & Co., et al., Case 1:21-cv-00460-LPS (D. Del. 2021) (the \"Summary Judgment Appeal\"). \n2 (Id. at 2-3) \n4. On March 16, 2021, the Bankruptc y Court entered its March 16 Notice, setting an \nobjection deadline for Appellee of June 3, 2021, and a hearing date of June 24, 2021, thereby \nfulfilling Appellant 's request for a hearing on his putative sanctions motion. (App. Exh. 3) On the \nsame day, Appellee served the March 16 Notice to Appellant by e-mail correspondence and \nby next-day mail. (App. Exh. 4) The Clerk of Court docketed a Certificate of Service on March 18, \n2021. (App. Exh. 5) \n5. As indicated by the docket of the chapter 11 case, Appellant never filed his sanctions \nmotion, nor did he file a motion to compel the Reorganized Debtor to produce documents . (App. \nExh. 1) On June 4, 2021, one day after the objection deadline set forth in the Bankruptcy Court's \nMarch 16 Notice, Appellee filed its Request to Cancel Hearing. (Bankr. D.I. 33231; App. Exh. 6) \n6. As discussed in Appellee's Request to Cancel Hearing, Appellant had acknowledged \nduring a \"meet and confer\" telephone conference on June 3, 2 021, regarding a briefing schedule for \nthe pending Summary Judgment Appeal: \nthe need to cancel the June 24 hearing and informed counsel that he would request \nsuch cancellation. Subsequent to that conference, Mr. Smolker sent e-mail \ncorrespondence to counsel for the Reorganized Debtor stating that he was refusing to \nrequest cancellation of the hearing, even though he had not timely filed his motion. \n(Id. at 2 & Exh. C) \n7. On June 21, 2021, Appellant's Response to Appellee's Request to Cancel Hearing \nwas docketed, comprising the following documents : (i) Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure , \nRule 7008 Notice: Pleader Gary Smolker Does Not Consent to Entry of Final Orders or Judgments \nof the Bankruptcy Court with respect to W.R. Grace & Co.'s Pending Motion to Cancel June 24, \n2021 Hearing Date, dated June 16, 2021; (ii) Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure , Rule 7008 \nNotice: Pleader Gary Smolker Does Not Consent to Entry of Final Orders or Judgments of the \nBankruptcy Court with respect to Gary Smolker's Ex-Parte Application/Motion for Protective Order \n3 and Impostion [sic] of Sanctions on W.R. Grace & Co. Attorneys Roger J. Higgins, Laura Davis \nJones, and James E. 0 'Neill; and (iii) Declaration of Lauren Elder In Support of Sanction Motion \nGary Smolker Requests Be Heard on June 24, 2021, dated June 16, 2021 (the \"Elder Declaration \"). \n(App. Exh. 7) Appellant also filed his Objection to Appellee 's Request to Cancel Hearing. (App. \nExh. 8) Attached to Appellant 's Objection was a pleading captioned Statement of Relief Sought by \nGary Smolker in Ex Parte Motion Gary Smolker Seeks to Have Heard on June 24, 2021 at 12:00 \nP.M. By Honorable Ashely M. Chan, United States Bankruptcy Judge, dated June 17, 2021. \n8. Later that same day, Appellee filed its Reply to Appellant 's Response and his \nObjection. (App. Exh. 9) On June 22, 2021, Appellee filed the Notice of Agenda for the June 24, \n2021 hearing. (App. Exh. 10) \n9. Following the filing of the agenda, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Order \nCancelling Hearing, cancelling the June 24, 2021 hearing. (Bankr. D.I. 33236; App. Exh. 11) The \nBankruptcy Court's Order Cancelling Hearing explained why the court had set a hearing for June \n24, 2021-which was to accommodate Appellant 's request in his March 15 Sanctions Hearing \nRequest discussed above, wherein Appellant asserted he would file a motion to compel production \nof documents, and then once that motion was decided by the Bankruptcy Court, he would file \nwithin another 60 days his putative sanctions motion. (Id. at ,r,r 3-4) \n10. The Order Cancelling Hearing stated that Appellant had filed neither his motion to \ncompel production of documents nor his putative sanctions motion. (Id. at ,r 5) In light of \nAppellant's failure to do either and the fact that Appellant 's failure meant that there was no \nsubstantive motion to go forward at the June 24 hearing, the Bankruptcy Court granted Appellee 's \nRequest to Cancel on June 22, 2021. (Id. at ,r 7) The Bankruptcy Court made it clear that the Order \nCancelling Hearing was \"without prejudice to Smolker filing and properly noticing his Proposed \n4 Sanctions Motion for a hearing in accordance with the applicable legal rules at a later date when he \nis ready to do so.\" (Id.) \n11. The Bankruptcy Court's Order Cancelling Hearing also addressed the new issues that \nwere raised in Appellant 's Objection and Response (which the Order Cancelling Hearing defined as \nthe \"Protective Order Request\") . (Id. at, 7 nn.1-2) The Bankruptcy Court specifically noted in the \nOrder Cancelling Hearing that the sanctions reliefrequested in the Objection was distinct from the \ngravamen of the proposed sanctions motion discussed in Appellant 's March 16 Sanctions Hearing \nRequest. (Id. at n.1) Instead of seeking millions of dollars in monetary sanctions against \nAppellee's counsel, Appellant was now requesting that Appellee 's counsel pay for certain of \nAppellant 's living expenses in an amount of somewhat less than $10,000. The Bankruptcy Court \nfurther noted that Appellant was also requesting injunctive relief in his Protective Order Request\u00ad\nto wit, seeking an order that would \"essentiall y prohibit\" Appellee from \"from filing any 'pleadings \nor letters' with the Bankruptcy Court for sixty days.\" (Id.) The Bankruptcy Court noted that \nAppellant did not state whether he was requesting a preliminary injunction or a temporary \nrestraining order, nor did he identify any injury he would suffer absent the requested relief, let alone \nan irreparable injury. (Id.) \n12. \"Ultimately ,\" the Bankruptcy Court stated, \"the Protective Order Request was not \nbefore the Court.\" (Id.) There is also nothing in the Order Cancelling Hearing precluding or \notherwise restricting Appellant in any way from filing and properly noticing new pleadings \nrequesting the relief sought in the Protective Order Request. \n13. On June 22, 2021, subsequent to the Bankruptcy Court's having entered the Order \nCancelling Hearing, Appellee filed a Cancellation Agenda, informing parties-in-interest that the \nhearing had been cancelled. (App. Exh. 12) On July 2, 2021, Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal. \n(App. Exh. 14) \n5 14. Jurisdiction. The Order Cancellin g Hearing is an interlocutory order. This Court \nhas jurisdiction to hear appeals \"from interlocutory orders and decrees, of bankruptcy judges \nentered in cases and proceedings referred to the bankruptc y judges under section 157 of this title.\" \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). The notice of appeal was not accompanied by a motion for leave to appeal, \nas required under Bankruptcy Rule 8004. Nevertheless , the Court may construe the Notice of \nAppeal as a motion and still consider whether to grant leave to appeal the Order Cancelling \nHearing. \n15. Applicable standards. Section 158(a) does not identify the standard district courts \nshould use in deciding whether to grant such an interlocutory appeal. See id. \"Typically , however, \ndistrict courts follow the standards set forth under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), which govern interlocutory \nappeals from a district court to a court of appeals.\" In re AE Liquidation , Inc., 451 B.R. 343,346 \n(D. Del. 2011). \n16. Under the standards of\u00a7 1292(b ), an interlocutory appeal is permitted only when the \norder at issue (1) involves a controlling question of law upon which there is (2) substantial ground \nfor difference of opinion as to its correctness , and (3) if appealed immediately , may materiall y \nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b); Katz v. Carte Blanche \nCorp., 496 F.2d 747, 754 (3d Cir. 1974). Entertaining review of an interlocutory order under\u00a7 \n1292(b) is appropriate only when the party seeking leave to appeal \"establishes exceptional \ncircumstances (to] justify a departure from the basic policy of postponing review until after the \nentry of final judgment. \" In re Del. and Hudson Ry. Co., 96 B.R. 469, 472-73 (D. Del. 1989), ajf'd, \n884 F.2d 1383 (3d Cir. 1989). Further, leave for interlocutory appeal may be denied for \"entirely \nunrelated reasons such as the state of the appellate docket or the desire to have a full record before \nconsidering the disputed legal issue.\" Katz, 496 F.2d at 754. \n6 17. Discussion. First, the appeal is patently frivolous . Appeals are frivolous when they \nmake \"[ c ]laims that ignore contrary case law, offer no colorable argument or support, present \nincomprehensible arguments, or contain nothing of substance or merit.\" Lewis v. Smith, 2010 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 27606, at *7-8 (3d Cir. July 28, 2010) (in reference to Fed. R. App. P. 38) (internal \ncitation omitted)). \n19. Applying this objective standard, the appeal of the Order Cancelling Hearing is \npatently frivolous. Appellant filed neither the motion to compel document production nor the \nfollow-on sanctions motion that he had insisted the Bankruptcy Court schedule for hearing. \nAppellant also failed to cancel the hearing. With no pending motion, Appellee had little choice but \nto request cancellation of the hearing or otherwise waste time and resources of the parties and the \nBankruptcy Court. Appellant's apparent argument that the Bankruptcy Court should have held a \nhearing on untiled motions is fairly characterized as \"incomprehensible\" and \"contain[ing] nothing \nof substance or merit.\" Id. at *7-8. Although Appellant purported to raise new grounds for \nsanctions and injunctive relief at the last moment in his Protective Order Request, Appellant offers \nno reasonable argument that the Protective Order Request was properly before the Bankruptcy \nCourt at the time of the June 24 hearing and thus \"no colorable argument or support\" for the appeal. \nId. \n20. Second, the appeal is clearly interlocutory and does not meet the standards of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The appeal presents no controlling question oflaw. The Order Cancelling \nHearing is entirely procedural in nature-cancelling a hearing and determining that the Protective \nOrder Request was not properly before the Bankruptcy Court due to its procedural infirmities under \nthe relevant Local Rules. The Order Cancelling Hearing affects no substantive rights, as it has \nabsolutely no preclusive effect on any sanctions motion Appellant wishes to file in the future. \nAppellant has presented no appealable issue, let alone one of controlling law. \n7 22. Appellant's various pleadings fail to dispute any of the central tenets of the Motion \nto Dismiss. Indeed, the issues that Appellant does raise-including the ad hominem attacks against \nAppellee's counsel-merely highlight the frivolous nature of his appeal. \n23. Conclusion. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court hereby ORDERS that: \n(i) The Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. \n(ii) Based on the inflammatory, threatening, and wholly inappropriate language \ncontained in the Memorandum of Points and Authorities (D.I. 7 at 1) and Designation oflssues on \nAppeal (D.I. 8-1 at 6) filed by Appellant , any future filings by Appellant in this matter may be \ndocketed but not considered by the Court. Appellee shall not be required to respond to any future \nfilings by Appellant unless otherwise ordered by this Court. The Court will consider imposing \nsanctions in the event that Appellant continues his pattern of abusive filings with respect to this \nappeal. \n(iii) The Clerk of the Court is directed to CLOSE Civ.
