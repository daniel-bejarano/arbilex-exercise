Civil Action No. 21-298-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nJimmy C. Chong, THE CHONG LAW FIRM, P.A., Wilmington , DE. \nAttorney for Plaintiff. \nRodger D. Smith II, MORRIS , NICHOLS , ARSHT & TUNNEL LLP, Wilmington , DE; Jon V. \nSwenson , BAKER BOTTS LLP, Palo Alto, CA. \nAttorneys for Defendants. \nFebruary l, 2022 \n1 Before me is Defendant 's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (D.I. 12). Defendant \nCambium Networks argues Plaintiff Aperture Net's First Amended Complaint (D.I. 11) fails to \nstate a claim of direct infringement and contributory infringement. The issue has been fully briefed \nand I have reviewed the parties' briefing and supplemental materials. (D.I. 13, 17, 19, 20). \nI. BACKGROUND \nAperture alleges Cambium has directly and indirectly infringed claims 25 and 26 (\"the \nAsserted Claims\") of U.S. Patent No. 6,711,204 (''the '204 patent\"). The '204 patent is directed \ntoward an improvement in spread-spectrum code-division-multiple-access (\"SS-CDMA\") \nwireless communication systems. SS-CDMA systems use spread-spectrum modulation to allow a \nsingle communication channel to service multiple users at once. (D.I. 11-1 at 3:34-41). The \nclaimed SS-CDMA system involves a base station communicating with a plurality of remote \nstations. Examples of remote stations can include mobile phones, computers , or laptops. (Id.). One \npotential issue with SS-CDMA systems is that, because remote stations can be located at various \ndistances from the base station, the remote stations' respective signals may arrive at the base station \nat different power levels. (D.I. 11-1 at 3:53-60). This variation in power levels can cause \ninterference when the stronger signals from closer remote stations block or inhibit reception of \nweaker signals from more distant remote stations. (Id.). The asserted claims disclose a method for \ncontrolling the power transmitted from remote stations (\"RS\") to base stations (\"BS\") \"so that the \npower received at the base station from each remote station is approximately the same.\" (D.I. 11-\n1 at 3:65-67; 4:1). \nThe method disclosed in claim 25 describes three distinct categories of signals: (1) signals \ntransmitted from the base station at a first frequency , (2) signals transmitted from a plurality of \n2 remote stations and received at the base station at a second frequency, and (3) a \"BS-channel\u00ad\nsounding signal\" transmitted from the base station and received by the remote stations at the \nsecond frequency. The remote stations use the BS-channel-sounding signal to adjust the power \nlevel of their respective signals. \nClaim 25 reads: \nAn improvement to a spread-spectrum method having a base station and a plurality \nof remote stations (RS), comprising the steps of: \ntransmitting , from said base station, a plurality of BS-spread-spectrum \nsignals at a first frequency ; \ntransmitting , from said plurality of remote stations, a plurality of RS-spread\u00ad\nspectrum signals; \nreceiving , at said base station, at a second frequency, the plurality of RS\u00ad\nspread-spectrum signals transmitted from said plurality of remote stations, \nrespectively ; \ntransmitting , from said base station, a BS-channel-sounding signal at the \nsecond frequency; \nreceiving , at said plurality of remote stations, the BS-channel-sounding \nsignal at the second frequency; and \nadjusting , at said plurality ofremote stations, responsive to the BS-channel\u00ad\nsounding signal, an initial RS-power level of said plurality of remote \nstations. \nClaim 26 is a dependent claim that discloses the method from claim 25 such that \nthe BS-spread-spectrum signals at the first frequency are outside a \"correlation bandwidth \" \nof the RS-spread signals transmitted by the remote stations at the second frequency. \nClaim 26 reads: \nThe improvement as set forth in claim 25, with the step of transmitting the plurality \nof BS-spread-spectrum signals including the step of transmitting the plurality of \nBS-spread-spectrum signals at the first frequency outside a correlation bandwidth \nof the plurality of RS-spread-spectrum signals transmitted by the plurality ofremote \nstations at the second frequency. \n3 II. LEGAL STANDARD \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(6), \nthe Court must accept the complaint 's factual allegations as true. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Rule 8(a) requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Id. at 555. The factual allegations do not have to be detailed, \nbut they must provide more than labels, conclusions , or a \"formulaic recitation \" of the claim \nelements. Id. (\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true ( even if doubtful in \nfact).\"). Moreover , there must be sufficient factual matter to state a facially plausible claim to \nrelief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The facial plausibility standard is satisfied \nwhen the complaint's factual content \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. (\"Where a complaint pleads facts that are \nmerely consistent with a defendant 's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\" ( cleaned up)). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Direct Infringement \nDirect infringement of a method claim occurs \"where all steps of a claimed method are \nperformed or attributable to a single entity.\" Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., 797 \nF.3d 1020, 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The sale or manufacture of an accused device that performs each \nstep of the patented method is insufficient for a showing of direct infringement -actual \nperformance of the claimed process is required. Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Systems, Inc., 773 F .3d \n1201, 1221 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Alleging that a specific product meets \"each and every element of at \n4 least one claim\" of an asserted patent is sufficient to plead direct infringement. Disc Disease Sols. \nInc. v. VGH Sols., Inc., 888 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2018). \nThe method disclosed in claim 25 of the '204 patent requires the following elements: (1) a \nbase station, (2) remote stations, (3) the transmission of a plurality of BS-spread-spectrum signals \nfrom the BS at a first frequency , (4) RS-spread-spectrum signals transmitted from the RSs and \nreceived by the BS at a second frequency , (5) transmission of a BS-channel-sounding signal from \nthe BS at the second frequency , (6) reception of the BS-channel-sounding signal at the RSs and \npower-level adjustment by the RSs in response to the channel-sounding signal. \nHere, Aperture claims that Cambium 's cnPilot E400 (\"the Accused Product\"), a wireless \nhotspot, infringes claim 25 when used to provide Wi-Fi to smartphones, laptops, and other devices. \nAperture's claim chart, incorporated by reference into the First Amended Complaint (D.I. 11 at ,r \n16), identifies the Accused Product as the claimed base station and the computer devices to which \nit connects as the claimed remote stations, satisfying elements 1 and 2. (D.I. 11-2 at 2). When the \nAccused Product is in use, both the base station and the remote station(s) are under the control of \na single user. The claim chart roughly describes the following process: \n(1) The accused product transmits a plurality of BS-spread spectrum signals (beacon \nframes) \"at a first frequency ,\" satisfying element 3. (Id.). \n(2) These beacon frames contain connection parameters which enable mobile stations to \nconnect to the BS, including the channel frequency to be used for communication \nbetween the BS and the RSs. (Id.). Presumably , this \"measured\" channel frequency is \ndifferent than the frequency of the initial beacon frames, although Aperture does not \nexpressly state this in its claim chart. (See Id.). \n5 (3) The RSs connect to the network and start communicating with the BS using this second \nfrequency, satisfying element 4. (Id. (\"Once the frequency measurement is complete, \nboth the uplink and downlink communication takes place on the measured \nfrequency.\")) . \n(4) \"The base station transmits beacon frames (sounding signals) to the devices nearby at \nthe second frequency (measured/calculated frequency used for the uplink \ncommunication), \" satisfying element 5. (D.I. 11-2 at 14). \n(5) \"The Power Constraint element included in the beacon frames allows a device (trying \nto connect to the base station) to determine the local maximum transmit power in the \ncurrent channel\" and to adjust its power level accordingly , satisfying element 6. (Id.). \nCambium argues that the claim chart does not properly allege infringement because \n\"beacon frames\" are used to describe the BS-spread-spectrum signals, the RS-spread-spectrum \nsignals, and the BS-channel-sounding signal, despite the requirement that these are three distinct \nsignals and the first signal must be at a different frequency than the latter two. (D.I. 13 at 9-12). \nCambium does not explain, however, why the first set of beacon frames sent out by the Accused \nDevice containing the initial connection parameters cannot be different than the second set of \nbeacon frames sent out at the second frequency acting as channel-sounding-signals. Whether the \nbeacon frames Aperture identifies as the first signal and the beacon frames Aperture identifies as \nthe second and third signals are in fact different signals and, if they are, whether they operate at \ndifferent frequencies as required by the claims, are factual questions. As such, they are not \nappropriate for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage. For now, Aperture has plausibly pled \ndirect infringement by users of the Accused Device by alleging that the Accused Device performs \nall the steps of the claimed method. \n6 Cambium also argues that the IEEE 802.011 Wi-Fi standard that Aperture claims defines \n\"[t]he frequency used for the communication between the BS and the plurality of RS\" (D.I. 11-2 \nat 2) does not cover channel-sounding signals. (D.I. 13 at 11). This argument, too, presents a \ndispute that is premature at the motion to dismiss stage. \nFor the reasons stated above, I find that Aperture has plausibly alleged that use of the \nAccused Product directly infringes the Asserted Claims. Aperture's allegation that Cambium \ndirectly infringed \"by having its employees internally test and use, research and develop, and \ntroubleshoot\" the Accused Product is therefore sufficient to plausibly state a claim of direct \ninfringement by Cambium. (D.I. 11 at 1 14). Here, like in Sapphire Crossing , Aperture's \nadmittedly brief allegation relating to internal testing is sufficient because it is \"augmented \" by \nAperture's claim chart, which explains how use of the Accused Device directly infringes the '204 \npatent. Sapphire Crossing LLC v. Robinhood Markets, Inc., 2021 WL 149023, at *3 (D. Del. Jan. \n15, 2021). Therefore , Cambium 's motion to dismiss Aperture's claim of direct infringement by \nCambium is DENIED. \nB. Contributory Infringement \nAperture alleges that Cambium indirectly infringes the '204 patent by selling the Accused \nProduct with the \"knowledge that third parties, such as its customers, would engage in an \ninfringing use\" of the device. (D.I. 11 at 118). Aperture alleges that, because the Accused Device \nadheres to the IEEE 802.011 standard (which Aperture claims \"necessarily \" infringes the '204 \npatent as demonstrated in its claim chart), the Accused Device has no substantial non-infringing \nuses. (Id. at 1 19). \nTo state a claim of contributory infringement , a plaintiff must first demonstrate direct \ninfringement. In re Bill of Lading Transmission & Processing Sys. Pat. Litig., 681 F.3d 1323, 1336 \n7 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Once direct infringement is shown, contributory infringement occurs if (1) \"a \nparty sells or offers to sell\" an infringing device, (2) the device is \"material to practicing the \ninvention ,\" (3) the device has no \"substantial non-infringing uses,\" and (4) the device is \n\"known by the party to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such \npatent.\" Id. at 1337 (cleaned up). To demonstrate the fourth prong, the plaintiff must show the \ninfringer knew \"that the combination for which its components were especially made was both \npatented and infringing.\" Fujitsu Ltd. v. Netgear Inc., 620 F.3d 1321, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2010) \n( cleaned up). In other words, the plaintiff must plausibly plead that the alleged infringer had \nknowledge of the patent and knowledge that use of the accused product infringes the patent. \nHere, Aperture has plausibly pled direct infringement by end users of the Accused Device, \nthat Cambium sold or offered to sell the Accused Device, and that the Accused Device is material \nto practicing the claimed method. (D.I. 11 at ,r,r 13, 15, 18). Aperture has also plausibly pled that \nthe Accused Device has no substantial non-infringing uses by alleging that the device adheres to \nthe IEEE 802.011 standard and alleging, as demonstrated in its claim chart, that the IEEE 802.011 \nstandard \"necessarily\" infringes the Asserted Claims. (D.I. 11 ,r 19; see D.I. 11-2). Cambium 's \narguments regarding how the IEEE 802.011 standard relates to the presence or absence of \nsubstantial non-infringing uses are factual disputes, inappropriate for resolution here. (D.I. 13 at \n13-15). \nAperture has not, however, plausibly pied that Cambium had pre-suit knowledge of the \nAccused Patents. The vague facts Aperture alleges to show knowledge of the '204 patent (e.g., \nthat the '204 patent's inventor had \"a substantial foundational body of work with which Defendant \nwas indisputably aware,\" that Defendant conducted prior art searches and freedom to operate \nanalyses, that Defendant 's own patents \"demonstrate a knowledge of the body of spread-spectrum \n8 patents\") are insufficient to plausibly allege pre-suit knowledge. (D.I. 11 at ,r 20). Aperture 's \nargument in the alternative, regarding willful blindness, is even weaker. (Id at ,r 20(d)). Aperture \ndoes not plead any specific facts to show Cambium (1) subjectively believed there was a high \nprobability its components were both patented and infringing and (2) took deliberate actions to \navoid learning that fact. (Id; Global-Tech Appliances , Inc. v. SEES.A., 563 U.S. 754,769 (2011)). \nFor these reasons, Cambium 's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim of pre-suit \ncontributory infringement is GRANTED . Cambium 's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \nof post-suit contributory infringement1 is DENIED . \nIV. CONCLUSI ON \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant 's motion to dismiss is DENIED with respect to \nAperture's claim of direct infringement. Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED with respect \nto Aperture 's claim of pre-suit contributory infringement and DENIED with respect to Aperture 's \nclaim of post-suit contributory infringement. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \nI take judicial notice of the fact that Aperture 's First Amended Complaint can operate to \nplead the knowledge of the patent element of indirect infringement since the filing of its original \ncomplaint. Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook , Inc., 2021 WL 4477022, at *7 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021). \n9 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nAPERTURE NET LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nCivil Action No. 21-298-RGA V. \nCAMBIUM NETWORKS , INC., \nDefendant . \nORDER \nFor the reasons stated in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, the motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a claim (D.I. 12) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The claim of \npre-suit contributory infringement of the '204 patent is DISMISSED. \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED. \nsr \nEntered this Day of February 2022. "}
