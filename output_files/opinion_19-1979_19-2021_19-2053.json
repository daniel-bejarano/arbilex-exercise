FINTEL\u2019S TESTIMONY  \nI have reviewed Plaintiff\u2019s motion to preclude  and the parties\u2019 subsequent briefing  on the \nmotion. (D.I. 670, 685, 694).   \nPlaintiff has moved to preclude Dr. Fintel , a clinical cardiologist,  from opining on (1) the \ninterpretation of chemical names, structures, and synthetic pathways, and (2) animal models of \nhypertension and heart failure.  (D.I. 670  at 2-5).  Plaintiff argues that because Dr. Fintel is \nconcededly not an expert in chemistry or animal models , he is not qualified to testify  about  these \nmatters.  Id.  Dr. Fintel\u2019s  expected testimony, however, does not require him  to be a formal expert \nin either area.  The Third Circuit assesses an expert\u2019s qualifications generously; \u201ca broad range of \nknowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert as such.\u201d  In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 \nF.3d 717, 741 (3d Cir. 1994).  To  the extent that Dr. Fintel  addresses  chemistry and animal models \nof hypertension and heart failure , he may do so from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill \nin the art who is a clinical cardiologist with whatever  degree of knowledge  a clinical cardiologist 2 \n would have of each topic.  See, e.g., Shire Viropharma, Inc. v. CSL Behring LLC , 2021 WL \n1227097, at *34- 35 (D. Del. Mar. 31, 2021) ( drug formulator  found qualified to testify to a \nformulator\u2019s perspective of certain medical effects of a composition  despite not being qualified as \na medical expert ).   \nPlaintiff also argues that  because Defendants failed to  disclose  Dr. Fintel\u2019s reliance on other \nexperts  for h is identification of certain compounds as  \u201csacubitril\u201d and \u201csacubitrilat ,\u201d he should be \nprecluded from making those identifications  at trial.  ( D.I. 694 at 4).  As  it is uncontroversial that  \nthe shorthand names  are accurate synonyms for the longer chemical names  disclosed in the patents \nand prior art references , I will allow Dr. Fintel to use the shorthand names  even if his expert reports \ndo not attribute that usage to D efendant s\u2019 chemistry  expert .  \nI recognize the \u201cgate -keeper\u201d function of a federal trial judge.  In a bench trial, however,  \nit is less important that the judge perform this function pretrial .  See In re Salem , 465 F.3d 767, \n777 (7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Brown, 415 F.3d 1257, 1269- 70 (11th Cir. 2005); Sanofi -\nAventis U.S. LLC v. Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., 2018 WL 2422003, *2 (D.Del. May 29, 2018); \nSanofi v. Glenmark Pharms. Inc ., 2016 WL 10957311, *1 (D.Del. May 12, 2016).  Whether Dr. \nFintel generally is giving appropriate scientific testimony is best resolved in the context of live \ntestimony, cross -examination, and the presentation of contrary evidence.  See Daubert v. Merrell \nDow Pharms. Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 595 (1993).  In particular, w hether Dr. Fintel  is giving scientific \ntestimony outside his expertise may involve close calls that would best be decided in the specific context of questions and answers  at trial.  Plaintiff may object at trial to specific portions of Dr. \nFintel\u2019s testimony at the appropr iate times , and, indeed, to preserve any objection, must timely 3 \n make those object ions.  To the extent Dr. Fintel \u2019s testimony arguably exceeds  his expertise, I \nexpect effective cross -examination would reveal that.      \nFor these reasons , Plaintiff\u2019s motion  (D.I. 670) is  DENIED without prejudice  to renew by \nobjections to specific testimony at trial. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n Entered this 9\nth day of  September , 2022.  \n   \n_/s/ Richard G.
