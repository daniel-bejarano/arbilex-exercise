Civil Action No. 20-413-RGA \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nHarold Edwards. Pro se Petitioner. \nKathryn Joy Garrison, Deputy Attorney General of the Delaware Department of Justice, \nWilmington , Delaware. Attorney for Respondents. \nFebruary i_, 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware ~~ D STATES DISTRICT JUDGE: \nPresently pending before the Court is Petitioner Harold Edwards' Petition for a Writ of \nHabeas Corpus Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\"Petition\"). (D.I. 1) The State filed an Answer in \nopposition. (D.I. 7) For the reasons discussed, the Court will dismiss the Petition. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn May 27, 2014, Delaware State police arrested Petitioner after he attempted to steal a \nbox full of cartons of Newport 100s cigarettes from an Exxon convenience store in Claymont , \nDelaware. (D.I. 8-2 at 12-16; D.I. 8-3 at 3, 73-74, 80, 110) The manager of the store grabbed \nPetitioner before he could leave and managed, along with a mechanic, to hold Petitioner until the \npolice came. (D.I. 8-2 at 12-16; D.I. 8-3 at 75-77, 87-88) The manager was injured while \nstruggling with Petitioner. (D.I. 8-2 at 12, 15; D.I. 8-3 at 79, 91) The police charged Petitioner \nwith first degree robbery. (D.I. 8-3 at 2) \nPetitioner was the same person who had stolen cartons of Newport 1 00s from two Wawa \nconvenience stores on four separate occasions on April 20 and 21, and May 24, 2014. (D.I. 8-2 \nat 9-12; D.I. 8-3 at 58) In each case, Petitioner asked a cashier for one or two cartons of \ncigarettes and then grabbed the cigarettes from the cashier without paying for them. (D.I 8-2 at 9-\n12; D.I. 8-3 at 63-64, 70, 124-25) During the last incident, Petitioner threatened the cashier with \na knife when the cashier refused to give him the cartons. (D.I. 8-2 at 11-12; D.I. 8-3 at 125-26) \nOn August 4, 2014, a New Castle County grand jury indicted Petitioner on two counts of \nfirst degree robbery and three counts of shoplifting less than $1,500. (D.I. 8-1 at Entry No. 2; \nD.I. 8-2 at 6) In May 2015, a Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of all charges. (D.I. 8-1 at \nEntry No. 39) The State moved to declare Petitioner a habitual offender for one count of frrst \ndegree robbery. (D.I. 8-1 at 39, 41) At the time, Petitioner had another case pending sentencing, in which he had pled guilty to one count of second degree forgery. (D.I. 8-3 at 17-18) The State \nalso filed a motion in that case to have Petitioner sentenced as a habitual offender. (D.I 8-3 at \n18) Prior to sentencing , Petitioner and the State agreed to recommend a sentence of seventeen \nyears of total unsuspended jail time, in exchange for the State withdrawing its petition to have \nPetitioner declared a habitual offender for first-degree robbery. (D.I. 8-3 at 205) The Superior \nCourt followed the parties' recommendation and sentenced Petitioner on December 18, 2015 as \nfollows: (1) for second degree forgery, to two years at Level V incarceration as an habitual \noffender; (2) for first degree robbery, to fifteen years at Level V, suspended after ten years for \ndecreasing levels of supervision ; (3) for first degree robbery, to ten years at Level V, suspended \nafter five years for one year of Level III probation; and ( 4) for each count of shoplifting, to one \nyear at Level V, suspended for one year of Level III probation. (D.I. 8-3 at 206, 208-210) \nPetitioner appealed. Trial counsel filed a \"no-merit\" brief pursuant to Delaware Supreme \nCourt Rule 26(c) along with a motion to withdraw . (D.I. 8-2 at 1-36); see Edwards v. State, 157 \nA.3d 1233 (Table), 2017 WL 772498, at *1 (Del. Feb. 27, 2017). In the non-merit brief, trial \ncounsel presented various claims Petitioner wished to be considered on appeal. (D.I. 8-2 at 22-\n33) The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner 's convictions and sentences on February \n27, 2017. See Edwards, 2017 WL 772498, at *5. \nOn April 5, 2017, Petitioner filed a prose motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to \nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\"Rule 61 motion\") and a motion for the appointment \nof counsel. (D.I. 8-11 at 121-124) The Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Petitioner. \n(D.I. 8-1 at 71) On August 17, 2018, appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw and a \nmemorandum presenting Petitioner 's arguments . (D.I. 8-1 at 72; D.I. 8-9) On October 12, 2018, \nthe Superior Court denied Petitioner's Rule 61 motion and granted appointed counsel's motion to \n3 withdraw. See State v. Edwards, 2018 WL 4962091, at *3 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 12, 2018). \nPetitioner filed an appeal, but the Delaware Supreme Court dismissed the appeal under Delaware \nSupreme Court Rule 6 for lack of jurisdiction because it was untimely. See Edwards v. State, \n210 A.3d 723 (Table), 2019 WL 2064533, at *1 (Del. May 8, 2019). \nII. EXHAUSTION AND PROCEDURAL DEFAULT \nAbsent exceptional circumstances , a federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the \npetitioner has exhausted all means of available relief under state law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b ); \n0 'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842-44 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 \n(1971). The AEDPA states, in pertinent part: \nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in \ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be \ngranted unless it appears that -\n(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts \nof the State; or \n(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or \n(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to \nprotect the rights of the applicant. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(l). \nThe exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity, requiring a petitioner to \ngive \"state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one \ncomplete round of the State's established appellate review process.\" 0 'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at \n844-45; see Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 192 (3d Cir. 2000). A petitioner satisfies the \nexhaustion requirement by demonstrating that the habeas claims were \"fairly presented\" to the \nstate's highest court, either on direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding, in a procedural \nmanner permitting the court to consider the claims on their merits. Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, \n451 n.3 (2005); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351 (1989). A federal legal claim is \"fairly \n4 presented\" to state courts when there is: \"(1) reliance on pertinent federal cases employing \nconstitutional analysis; (2) reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in like fact \nsituations; (3) assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a specific right \nprotected by the Constitution; [or] ( 4) allegation of a pattern of facts that is well within the \nmainstream of constitutional litigation. \" McCandless v. Vaughn, 172 F.3d 255, 261 (3d Cir. \n1999). \nA petitioner 's failure to exhaust state remedies will be excused if state procedural rules \npreclude him from seeking further relief in state courts. See Lines v. Larkins, 208 F.3d 153, 160 \n(3d Cir. 2000). Although treated as technically exhausted , such claims are nonetheless \nprocedurally defaulted. See Lines, 208 F.3d at 160. Similarly , if a petitioner presents a habeas \nclaim to the state's highest court, but that court \"clearly and expressly\" refuses to review the \nmerits of the claim due to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the claim is \nexhausted but procedurally defaulted. See Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); \nHarris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 260-65 (1989). \nFederal courts may not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims unless the \npetitioner demonstrates either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice resulting \ntherefrom, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the court does not review the \nclaims. See McCandless, 172 F.3d at 260. To demonstrate cause for a procedural default, a \npetitioner must show that \"some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's \nefforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\" Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478,488 \n(1986). To demonstrate actual prejudice , a petitioner must show \"that [the errors at trial] worked \nto his actual and substantial disadvantage , infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional \ndimensions. \" Id. at 494. \n5 Alternatively, a federal court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner \ndemonstrates that failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. \nSee Edwards v. Carpenter , 529 U.S. 446,451 (2000); Wenger v. Frank, 266 F.3d 218,224 (3d \nCir. 2001 ). A petitioner demonstrates a miscarriage of justice by showing a \"constitutional \nviolation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\" Murray, 477 \nU.S. at 496. Actual innocence means factual innocence , not legal insufficiency. See Bousley v. \nUnited States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). In order to establish actual innocence, the petitioner \nmust present new reliable evidence -not presented at trial -that demonstrates \"it is more likely \nthan not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \nHouse v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 537-38 (2006); see Sweger v. Chesney, 294 F.3d 506, 522-24 (3d \nCir. 2002). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nPetitioner 's timely filed \u00a7 2254 Petition asserts three claims for relief: ( 1) trial, appellate, \nand post-conviction counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that: (a) the State \nviolated Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S. 79 (1986) during jury selection when it exercised \nperemptory strikes against black jurors; and (b) the State violated Jencks v. United States, 353 \nU.S. 657 (1957) and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) by failing to turn over prior witness \nstatements (D.I. 1 at 5); (2) the State violated Batson during jury selection when it exercised \nperemptory strikes against black jurors (D.I. 1 at 7); and (3) the State failed to turn over prior \nwitness statements as required by Jencks and Brady. (D.I. 1 at 8). \nA. Claim One: Ineffective Assistance of Trial, Appellate, and Post-Conviction \nCounsel \nIn Claim One, Petitioner asserts that: (a) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a \nBatson claim during his trial (\"IA TC Batson\") and for failing to request Jencks/Brady material \n6 (\"IA TC Jencks/Brady\"); (b) appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the free\u00ad\nstanding Batson and Jencks/Brady material claims (Claims Two and Three) on direct appeal \n(\"IAAC\" arguments); and (c) post-conviction counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the free\u00ad\nstanding Batson and Jencks/Brady claims (Claims Two and Three) in his Rule 61 motion. (DI. 1 \nat 5) \n1. Claim One (a): Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel \nThe record reveals that Petitioner's IATC Batson argument is exhausted but procedurally \ndefaulted. (D.I. 8-9 at 11) Although Petitioner presented the IATC Batson argument in his Rule \n61 motion -which was denied 1 -the Delaware Supreme Court dismissed his Rule 61 appeal as \nuntimely filed under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 6. See Edwards , 2019 WL 2064533, at *1. \nBy applying the procedural bar of Rule 6, the Delaware Supreme Court articulated a \"plain \nstatement \" under Harris v. Reed that its decision rested on state law grounds. See Harris, 489 \nU.S. at 264-65. In turn, Delaware Supreme Court Rule 6 is an independent and adequate state \nprocedural rule effectuating a procedural default. See Tribuani v. Phelps, 820 F. Supp. 2d 588, \n592-93 (D. Del. 2011). Therefore , the Court cannot review the merits of the IATC Batson \nargument in Claim One (a) absent a showing of cause for the default, and prejudice resulting \ntherefrom, or upon a showing that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the claim is not reviewed. \nIn addition, the record reveals that Petitioner 's IA TC Jencks/Brady argument is \nunexhausted because he did not include it in his Rule 61 motion or on post-conviction appeal. At \nthis juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to present his IATC Jencks/Brady claim in a new Rule 61 \nmotion would be time-barred under Rule 61(i)(l). See DeAngelo v. Johnson, 2014 WL 4079357, \nat* 12 (D. Del. Aug. 15, 2014). Although Rule 61(i)(l) provides for an exception to the one-year \n1Edwards, 2018 WL 4962091, at *3. \n7 time limitation if the untimely Rule 61 motion \"asserts a retroactivel y applicable right that is \nnewly recognized after the judgment of conviction is final,\" no such right is implicated in the \ninstant IATC Jencks/Brady argument. Similarly , the exceptions to Rule 6l(i)(l)'s time-bar \ncontained in Rule 6l(i)(5) and (d)(2) do not apply to Petitioner 's case, because he does not allege \nactual innocence , lack of jurisdiction , or that a new rule of constitutional law applies to the \ninstant arguments. Given these circumstances, the Court must treat the instant IA TC \nJencks/Brady argument as procedurally defaulted , meaning that the Court cannot review the \nmerits of the argument absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice. \nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to establish cause for his default of both the IATC \nBatson and the IA TC Jencks/Brady arguments by alleging post-conviction counsel was \nineffective for not raising these IA TC arguments in his Rule 61 motion, the attempt is \nunavailing. In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1, 16-17 (2012), the Supreme Court held that \ninadequate assistance or the absence of counsel during an initial-review state collateral \nproceeding may (under certain circumstances ) establish cause for a petitioner's \nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Id. at 12, 16-17. The \nThird Circuit has explained the application of Martinez in habeas cases: \nMartinez recognizes a narrow exception to the doctrine of \nprocedural default: \"Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial\u00ad\nreview collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner's \nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.\" This \nexception is available to a petitioner who can show that: 1) his \nprocedurally defaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim \nhas \"some merit,\" and that 2) his state-post conviction counsel was \n\"ineffective under the standards of Strickland v. Washington.\" \nWorkman v. Sup't Albion SCI, 915 F.3d 928, 937 (3d Cir. 2019). \"To demonstrate that his claim \nhas some merit, a petitioner must 'show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that \nmatter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues \n8 presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"' Id. at 938 (quoting \nMiller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003)). To demonstrate that post-conviction counsel's \nineffectiveness caused the procedural default, a petitioner must show that post-conviction \ncounsel's performance was deficient under the first prong of the Strickland standard, i.e., \"that \nhis state post-conviction counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of \nreasonableness .\" Workman , 915 F.3d at 941. \nHere, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that his IA TC Batson and IA TC Jencks/Brady \narguments are substantial. The Superior Court actually considered the Batson claim (Claim \nTwo) presented in Petitioner 's Rule 61 motion, and concluded that the argument was meritless \nbecause the record of jury selection did not establish a prima facie case that the State exercised \nits peremptory strikes on the basis ofrace. See Edwards, 2018 WL 4962091, at *3. As for \nPetitioner 's IATC Jencks/Brady argument , the Delaware Supreme Court reviewed Petitioner 's \nJencks/Brady claim on direct appeal for plain error, and found that, whether or not the police \nnotes were discoverable or exculpatory , the \"record does not reflect that [Petitioner] was \nprejudiced by the State's failure to preserve the police officer's notes.\" Edwards , 2017 WL \n772498, at *3. Given the Delaware state court determinations regarding the underlying claims, \nPetitioner cannot show that \"the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to \nproceed further.\" See Workman , 915 F.3d at 941. In other words, Petitioner 's IATC Batson and \nIATC Jencks/Brady arguments lack \"some merit.\" Thus, post-conviction counsel's failure to \npresent the two IA TC arguments in Petitioner 's Rule 61 motion does not constitute cause . \nIn the absence of cause, the Court will not address the issue of prejudice . Additionall y, \ngiven Petitioner's failure to provide new reliable evidence of his actual innocence , Petitioner 's \nprocedural default cannot be excused under AEDP A's miscarriage of justice exception. \n9 Accordingly , the Court will deny Claim One (a) as procedurally barred from federal habeas \nreview. \n2. Claim One (b ): Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel \nThe record reveals that Petitioner did not exhaust state remedies for Claim One (b)' s \nIAAC arguments because he did not present the arguments to the Delaware state courts in his \nRule 61 motion or on post-conviction appeal. At this juncture, any attempt by Petitioner to \npresent the instant IAAC arguments in a new Rule 61 motion would be time-barred under Rule \n61(i)(l). See DeAngelo, 2014 WL 4079357, at* 12. None of the exceptions to the time-bar \ncontained in Rule 61 apply here. See Del. Super. Ct. R. 61(d)(2) and (i)(l), (5). As a result, the \nCourt must treat the instant IAAC arguments as procedurally defaulted , meaning that the Court \ncannot review the merits of the arguments absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a \nmiscarriage of justice. \nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to establish cause for his default of the IAAC arguments \nby alleging post-conviction counsel was ineffective for not raising his IAAC arguments in his \nRule 61 motion, the attempt is unavailing. The United States Supreme Court has not extended \nthe very limited Martinez exception to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims. See \nDavila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2068 (2017) (noting that the equitable concerns of Martinez do \nnot apply to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel); Ridgeway v. Sup 't Greene SCI, 2018 \nWL 4178848, at * 1 (3d Cir. June 21, 2018) (noting that Davila decided the previously-open \nquestion as to whether Martinez \"can and should be extended to a claim that post-conviction \ncounsel was ineffective for failing to raise a claim of ineffectiveness of appellate counsel.\"). \nPetitioner 's failure to establish cause for his default of Claim One (b) eliminates the need \nto address the issue of prejudice. And, once again, Petitioner 's failure to provide new reliable evidence of his actual innocence renders the miscarriage of justice exception inapplicable to his \ncase. Thus, the Court will deny Claim One (b) as procedurally barred. \n3. Claim One (c): Ineffective Assistance of Post-Conviction Counsel \nIn Claim One ( c ), Petitioner appears to allege that post-conviction counsel was \nineffective for failing to raise the Batson and Jencks/Brady claims (Claims Two and Three) in his \nRule 61 motion. There is no federal constitutional right to effective post-conviction \nrepresentation. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(i); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987) (\"Our \ncases establish that the right to appointed counsel extends to the first right of appeal and no \nfurther.\"). Therefore, the Court will dismiss Claim One (c) for failing to assert an issue \ncognizable on federal habeas review. \nB. Claim Two: Batson Violation \nIn Claim Two, Petitioner contends that the State violated Batson by exercising its \nperemptory strikes against black jurors. (D.I. 1 at 5, 7) The record reveals that Petitioner \npresented Claim Two to the Delaware Supreme Court as part of defense counsel's Rule 26(c) no\u00ad\nmerit brief and motion to withdraw . (D.I. 8-2) The Delaware Supreme Court reviewed Claim \nTwo for plain error under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 because Petitioner did not present the \nclaim to the trial court. See Edwards, 2017 WL 772498, at *5 & n. 36. By explicitly applying \nthe plain error doctrine to Claim Two, the Delaware Supreme Court articulated a \"plain \nstatement\" under Harris v. Reed that its decision rested on state law grounds. See Harris, 489 \nU.S. at 264-65. In turn, Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8 is an independent and adequate state \nprocedural rule effectuating a procedural default. See Campbell v. Burris, 515 F.3d 172, 182 (3d \nCir. 2008). Therefore, the Court cannot review the merits of Claim Two absent a showing of \n11 cause for the default, and prejudice resulting therefrom , or upon a showing that a miscarriage of \njustice will occur if the claim is not reviewed. \nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to establish cause by pointing to trial and appellate \ncounsel's failure to raise Claim Two during trial or on direct appeal, the attempt is unavailing . \nAs previousl y explained, Petitioner 's IATC and IAAC Batson arguments are procedurall y \ndefaulted. See supra at Section III.A.1 & 2. A procedurall y defaulted ineffective assistance of \ncounsel claim cannot excuse Petitioner 's procedural default of his substantive Batson Claim. See \nEdwards v. Carpenter , 529 U.S. 446, 453-54 (2000). \nGiven Petitioner 's failure to establish cause for his default of Claim Two, the Court will \nnot address the issue of prejudice. Nor can Petitioner 's procedural default be excused under the \nmiscarriage justice exception , because he has not provided new reliable evidence of his actual \ninnocence Thus, the Court will deny Claim Two as procedurally barred. \nC. Claim Three: Jencks/Brady Violation \nIn Claim Three, Petitioner argues that his rights under Jencks and Brady were violated \nbecause he did not receive \"state witness statements made prior to their trial testimony. \" (D.I. 1 \nat 8) On direct appeal, Petitioner argued that the State violated Jencks and Brady by failing \"to \npreserve the Exxon surveillance video and the police officer's interview notes as discoverable \nevidence.\" Edwards, 2017 WL 772498, at *3. The Court presumes that the \"state witness \nstatements \" referenced in Claim Three of the Petition in this case are the police officer's witness \ninterview notes mentioned on direct appeal. \nThe Delaware Supreme Court reviewed Petitioner 's Jencks/Brady argument concerning \nthe police officer's interview notes for plain error under Delaware Supreme Court Rule 8. As \npreviously explained , Rule 8 is an independent and adequate state law ground, which means that \n12 Petitioner's Jencks/Brady argument involving the police officer's interview notes is procedurall y \ndefaulted. Petitioner 's related IATC and IMC Jencks/Brady claims are themselves procedurally \ndefaulted and, therefore , cannot constitute cause for his default of the instant argument. The \nmiscarriage of justice exception is unavailable to excuse Petitioner 's default because he has not \nprovided new reliable evidence of his actual innocence. Therefore , to the extent the \nJencks/Brady argument in Claim Three involves the police officer's interview notes, the Claim is \nprocedurally barred from habeas review. \nIV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY \nA district court issuing a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition must also decide whether \nto issue a certificate of appealability. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). A \ncertificate of appealability is appropriate when a petitioner makes a \"substantial showing of the \ndenial of a constitutional right\" by demonstrating \"that reasonable jurists would find the district \ncourt's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); \nSlack v. McDaniel , 529 U.S. 473,484 (2000). Additionally , when a district court denies a \nhabeas claim or petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional \nclaims, the court is not required to issue a certificate of appealability unless the petitioner \ndemonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable : (1) whether the petition states a valid \nclaim of the denial of a constitutional right; and (2) whether the court was correct in its \nprocedural ruling. See Slack, 529 U.S. at 484. \nThe Court has concluded that the instant Petition does not warrant relief. Reasonable \njurists would not find this conclusion to be debatable. Accordingly , the Court will not issue a \ncertificate of appealability. \n13 V. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed , the Court will deny the Petition without holding an evidentiary \nhearing or issuing a certificate of appealability. An appropriate Order will be entered. \n14 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nHAROLD EDWARDS , \nPetitioner , \nV. \nROBERT MAY, Warden, and \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE \nSTATE OF DELAWARE, \nRespondents.
