(D.I. 1-1) MAIC removed\nthe case based on diversity jurisdiction to the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, and that court subsequently granted MAIC's motion to transfer the case to\nthis Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). (See D.I. 87 Ex. 2)\nPresently before the Court are MAIC's motion for choice of law (D.I. 86), PlaintifPs\nDaubert motion (D.I. 98), and summary judgment motions brought by both MAIC (D.I. 104) and\nPlaintiff (D.1.107). On January 6,2022, the Court heard argument on all four motions. (D.I.\n120) (\"Tr.\")\nHaving considered the parties' arguments and filings, and for the reasons below, the\nCourt will deny Plaintiffs Daubert motion; grant in part and deny in part Defendant's summary\njudgment motion; and deny Plaintiffs summary judgment motion. The Court agrees with\nDefendant's analysis as to which substantive law governs Plaintiffs various claims, and has\napplied the law accordingly in deciding the parties' dispositive motions.\nI. BACKGROUND \u2022\nOn October 11,2018, during heavy rains brought by Hurricane Michael, Plaintiffs boat\nsank while it was moored in Ocean View, Delaware. (See D.I. 108 at 2; id. Ex. E at 1) The 2017\n^ Plaintiff notes that MAIC filed a five-page statement of facts separate from its brief in support\nof its motion for summary judgment, without seeking leave for an extension of the twenty-page\nlimit for dispositive motions. (See D.I. 114 at 2 n.4) Defendant explains it filed the \"separate\nexhibit because it believes it to be customary in federal court.\" (D.I. 115 at 1 n.2) The Court\nwill disregard the extra pages but will not, as Plaintiff requests, deny the motion \"on the basis of\nthis violation alone.\" (D.I. 114 at 2 n.4)\n139-foot Midnight Express (the \"Vessel\") was insured by MAIC, under Policy No.\nMHP00000361698 (the \"Policy\"), an \"all-risk,\" agreed $680,000 value, marine policy covering\nthe period between October 20,2017 and October 20,2018. (D.I. 108 Ex. B) The Policy's\nchoice-of-law provision provides:\nThis policy is subject to established principles and precedents of\nfederal admiralty law of the United States of America, but where\nno substantive principle or precedent is applicable state law shall\napply. Any provision of this policy that conflicts with applicable\nlaw or regulation is hereby amended to conform to the minimum\nrequirements of the law or regulation.\n(Mat 3)\nIn terms of coverage, the Policy states: \"We will cover sudden accidental direct physical\nloss or damage to the insured watercraft.\" (Jd. at 5) (emphasis omitted) The Policy includes\nseveral exclusions, one of which provides: \"We will not pay for loss, damage or expense caused\nby or resulting from... manufacturer's defects or design defects.\" (Id. at 6) (emphasis omitted)\nA design defect is defined in the Policy as \"a flaw in the structural plan of the insured\nwatercraft's hull or machinery, or any of its components.\" {Id. at 1) (emphasis omitted) The\nPolicy provides further that: \"It is warranted that the insured watercraft is seaworthy at the\ninception of this insuring agreement. Violation of this warranty voids this insuring agreement\nfrom its inception.\" {Id.) (emphasis omitted)\nOn June 1,2018, before the Vessel sank. Stokes negotiated and accepted the terms of an\nEndorsed Policy that allowed the Vessel to remain in Florida for two weeks past the contractual\nperiod. {See D.I. 95 at 14; D.I. 87 Ex. 4) He also added the Rickenbacker Marina in Florida as\nan additional insured to the Policy. (D.I. 87 Ex. 4) Stokes claims that he negotiated and\naccepted these terms while he was in Florida. {See D.I. 95 at 5-6)After the Vessel sank, Plaintiff filed a claim under the Policy, and MAIC performed an\ninitial survey of the Vessel. (See D.I. 108 at 3) MAIC's surveyor, Jonathan Klopman, reported\nthat \"[a] thunderstorm passed through the marina between 11:00 PM and midnight. The total\nrainfall for this time period was 7.29 inches. This is an extreme amount of rainfall by any\nmeasure.\" (D.I. 108 Ex. E at 4) After the initial survey, MAIC issued a reservation of rights\nletter on November 12,2018, stating that the Vessel may be unseaworthy and that any claim for\ncoverage may be subject to policy exclusions. (D.I. 108 Ex. F at 2-3) The letter also stated that\nMAIC could not yet determine whether coverage existed for Stokes' loss. (Id.) Although it has\nnow been over three years since the loss. Plaintiff alleges that MAIC has not yet formulated an\nofficial coverage position. (See D.I. 108 at 4)\nDespite this uncertainty as to coverage, MAIC has paid costs related to the loss. It issued\ninvoices related to the post-loss work and storage of the Vessel totaling at least $5,280.25, and it\npaid more than $15,199.00 for raising, salvaging, and towing the Vessel from the site of the loss\nto the Indian River Marina, where the Vessel remains today. (D.I. 108 at 6; id. Exs. E & H)\nMAIC has also paid indemnity payments related to the loss on behalf of Stokes. (See D.I. 108 at\n6)\nThe parties' experts disagree as to why the Vessel sank. In the view of Plaintiffs\nexperts, the sinking was caused by an \"excessive amount of rain from Hurricane Michael.\" (D.I.\n114 Ex. A at 1) By contrast. Defendant's expert, Robert K. Taylor, concluded that the Vessel\nwas \"defectively designed\" because \"the boat did not have an adequately designed cockpit\ndrainage system\" and \"the deck hatch located directly adjacent to the cockpit scuppers was\nneither watertight nor weathertight.\" (D.I. 99 Ex. A at 17) Alternatively, he opined that the lackof an owner's manual or signage instructing users of these inadequacies or recommending that\nthey cover the boat when not in use constituted design defects. (Id.')\nPlaintiff alleges that the Vessel was only in Delaware because MAIC required that he\nstore it there during hurricane season. (D.I. 36 Ex. 1 If 18) He claims that he purchased and\nregistered the Vessel in Florida, \"specifically for boating in Florida,\" and that his captain is\nlocated in Florida. (Id. ^ff 13-14) At the time the parties entered into the Policy, however.\nStokes' insurance agent was located in Maryland. (See D.l. 87 at 5) His application for\ninsurance for the Vessel lists his primary residence as being in the District of Coliimbia, where\nthe Policy was issued and delivered to him. (Id.) Stokes also lists a D.C. address as his primary\naddress in the Policy Declarations, which state that the Vessel's \"Unit Mooring Location\" is in\nMaryland. (D.l. 87 Ex. 3 at 307)\nn. LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Daubert Motions to Exclude\nIn Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993), the\nSupreme Court explained that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 creates \"a gatekeeping role for the\n[trial] judge\" in order to \"ensur[e] that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation\nand is relevant to the task at hand.\" Rule 702(a) requires that expert testimony \"help the trier of\nfact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Expert testimony is admissible\nonly if \"the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,\" \"the testimony is the product of\nreliable principles and methods,\" and \"the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods\nto the facts of the case.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d).There are three distinct requirements for proper expert testimony: (1) the expert must be\nqualified; (2) the opinion must be reliable; and (3) the expert's opinion must relate to the\nfacts. See Elcockv. Kmart Corp., 233 F.3d 734, 741 (3d Cir. 2000).\nB. Summary Judgment\nPursuant to Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[t]he court shall grant\nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The moving party bears the burden\nof demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Matsushita Elec. Indus.\nCo., Ltd. V. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-87, 585 n.lO (1986). An assertion that a fact\ncannot be - or, alternatively, is - genuinely disputed must be supported either by \"citing to\nparticular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored\ninformation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the\nmotion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials\" or by \"showing that the\nmaterials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse\nparty cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) &\n(B). If the moving party has carried its burden, the nonmovant must then \"come forward with\nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587\n(internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The Court will \"draw all reasonable inferences\nin favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the\nevidence.\" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133,150 (2000).\nTo defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must \"do more than\nsimply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita, 475\nU.S. at 586; see also Podobnikv. U.S. Postal Serv., 409 F.3d 584, 594 (3d Cir. 2005) (statingparty opposing summary judgment \"must present more than just bare assertions, conclusory\nallegations or suspicions to show the existence of a genuine issue\") (internal quotation marks\nomitted), abrogated on other grounds by Rotkiske v. Klemm, 890 F.3d 422 (3d Cir. 2018). The\n\"mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise\nproperly supported motion for sununary judgment.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., All U.S.\n242,247-48 (1986). A factual dispute is genuine only where \"the evidence is such that a\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. at 248. \"If the evidence is\nmerely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\" Id. at\n249-50 (internal citations omitted); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, All U.S. 317, 322 (1986)\n(stating entry of summary judgment is mandated \"against a party who fails to make a showing\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that\nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial\"). Thus, the \"mere existence of a scintilla of\nevidence\" in support of the nonmoving party's position is insufficient to defeat a motion for\nsummary judgment. Anderson, All U.S. at 252. To defeat the motion, \"there must be evidence\non which the jury could reasonably find\" for the nonmoving party. Id.\nni. DISCUSSION\nA. Defendant's Choice-of-Law Motion\nThe parties disagree about which law governs Plaintiffs various claims. Defendant\nargues the Court should apply either federal admiralty law or the substantive law of the District\nof Columbia, depending on the nature of the claim. Plaintiff appears to agree that federal\nadmiralty law applies to some of his claims but contends that Florida substantive law governs all\nof the others.When federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the Court applies the forum\nstate's choice-of-law rules. See Kaneffv. Del. Title Loans, Inc., 587 F.3d 616, 621 (3d Cir.\n2009). Where, as here, a civil case has been transferred from one district court to another\npursuant to \u00a7 1404(a), the transferee court applies the law of the transferor state, including its\nchoice-of-law rules, as if there had been no change of venue. See Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376\nU.S. 612, 639 (1964) (\"A change of venue under \u00a7 1404(a) generally should be, with respect to\nstate law, but a change of courtrooms.\"); Lafferty v. St. Kiel, 495 F.3d 72, 76 (3d Cir. 2007). In\ngranting Defendant's motion to transfer this case. Judge Altonaga affirmed this principle, stating\nthat \"Florida's choice-of-law rules will apply to the action regardless of the final forum.\" (D.I.\n87 Ex. 2 at 9) While the Court is not bound by Judge Altonaga's determination, it agrees that\nFlorida's choice-of-law rules apply in determining which law governs PlaintifPs various claims.\n1. PlaintifTs Breach of Contract Claim\nThe parties agree that the Policy is a marine insurance contract that includes a\npresumptively valid, clear, and unambiguous choice-of-law provision. (See Tr. at 5-6,15-17,19,\n26-27, 31) That provision contemplates two scenarios a court may face when interpreting the\nPolicy; (i) one in which established principles and precedents of federal admiralty law apply, and\n(ii) one in which no substantive federal admiralty principle or precedent applies. (D.l. 108 Ex. B\nat 3)\nThe parties appear to agree that, where the Court faces the first scenario, federal\nadmiralty substantive law applies. (See D.l. 87 at 7-12; Tr. at 21,22-23,26-27) Although\nPlaintifPs position on this point was not entirely clear fi*om the briefing. Plaintiff clarified at the\nhearing that \"admiralty law is going to apply on any established principles.\" (Tr. at 23; see also\nid. at 17 (\"[Tjhere [are] two types of law that will be applied: [ajdmiralty law, for those issues inwhich admiralty law speaks ... and the state law.\"); id. at 21 (\"[A]dmiralty law, if [there is] an\nestablished principle, should be applied.\")) Considering the consensus on this issue, and given\nthat the Policy's choice-of-law provision is presumptively valid under Florida's choice-of-law\nrules, see Se. Floating Docks, Inc. v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 82 So. 3d 73, 80 (Fla. 2012), the\nCourt concludes that federal admiralty law governs the Policy where established principles and\nprecedents of federal admiralty law exist.\nWhere the Court faces the second scenario, the parties' views diverge. To determine the\nsubstantive state law that applies in the absence of an established principle or precedent of\nfederal admiralty law. Defendant advocates for Florida's choice-of-law rules (see D.I. 87 at 8),\nwhile Plaintiff contends that - because the Policy is a maritime contract - the Court should apply\nfederal admiralty choice-of-law rules {see Tr. at 19, 34-35). The Court concludes that under\neither of these approaches, Florida law does not govem.\nFlorida courts apply the lex loci contractus rule, which, \"as applied to insurance\ncontracts, provides that the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was executed governs the\nrights and liabilities of the parties in determining an issue of insurance coverage.\" State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Roach, 945 So. 2d 1160,1163 (Fla. 2006). Determining where a contract\nwas executed is fact-intensive and turns on where the \"last act necessary to complete the\ncontract\" occurred. Pierce v. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. of Hartford, 303 F. Supp. 3d 1302,1305\n(M.D. Fla. 2017). Courts have held that an offeree's communication of acceptance to the offeror\ncan constitute the \"last act necessary.\" See Prime Ins. Syndicate, Inc. v. B.J. Handley Trucking,\nInc., 363 F.3d 1089,1093 (11th Cir. 2004).\nMAIC asserts that Plaintiff purchased and executed the Policy in the District of Columbia\non October 18,2016. (D.l. 87 at 13) (citing id. Ex. 3 at 334-36) Plaintiffs initial applicationlists a primary phone number with a D.C. area code and address - to which the Policy and all\nrenewal documents were sent. {Id.) (citing id. Ex. 3 at 282, 321,326-28) Plaintiff responds that\non June 1,2018, while he was allegedly in Florida, he negotiated and accepted the terms of an\nEndorsed Policy that allowed the Vessel to remain in Florida for two weeks past the contractual\nperiod. (D.I. 95 at 14; D.I. 87 Ex. 4)\nPlaintiff, however, cites no authority for the notion that an endorsement amending certain\nprovisions of a contract can constitute a \"last act necessary\" under Florida law. Such a\nconclusion would conflict with the principles underlying the lex loci contractus rule, which\nrecognizes that, absent some contrary provision, the parties entering into a contract bargain for\nthe laws of the jurisdiction in which the contract was entered to control. See Roach, 945 So.2d at\n1164. Further, to the extent Plaintiff argues the Endorsed Policy is separate from the Policy or\nthat it alters the fundamental nature of the Policy (such that the parties contemplated a new\nbargain), the Court disagrees.\nNor is the Court persuaded that it should view Rickenbacker Marina (which Stokes\nincluded as an additional ensured under the Endorsed Policy) as an address in Florida to which\nMAIC could have delivered the Policy. {See Tr. at 16,21, 35; D.I. 87 Ex. 4 at 18) There is no\nevidence in the record that Stokes advised MAIC he had changed his residency or requested that\nPolicy-related documents could be sent to him at a specific Florida address. {See Tr. at 7-8,30)\nInstead, Stokes admitted that he is \"not a Florida resident\" and that his primary residence and\nprincipal place of business are in the District of Columbia.^ {See D.I. 87 Ex. 2 at 10)\n^ For the same reasons, PlaintifFs alleged ownership at some point of property in Florida does\nnot alter the lex loci contractus analysis. {See Tr. at 10,16; D.I. 87 Ex. 2 at 10)The Court concludes that the \"last act necessary to complete the contract\" occurred in the\nDistrict of Columbia, where the Policy was both executed and delivered to Stokes. Accordingly,\nthe substantive law of the District of Columbia applies in the absence of an established principle\nor precedent of federal admiralty law.^\nApplication of federal admiralty choice-of-law rules would also not yield the result\nPlaintiff seeks. The choice-of-law analysis in maritime contract cases considers \"which state has\nthe most significant relationship with the transaction at issue.\" Cont'l Cos. Co. v. Reese, 2006\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 48035, at *10 (M.D. Fla. July 14,2006); see also Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V\nOlympia Voyager, 446 F.3d 1377,1381 (11th Cir. 2006). As outlined in the Second Restatement\nof Conflict of Laws, the following factors help guide courts in making that determination: (a) the\nplace of contracting; (b) the place of negotiation; (c) the place of performance; (d) the locus of\nthe subject matter of the contract; and (e) the domicile of the parties. Restatement (Second) of\nConflict of Laws \u00a7 188 (Am. L. Inst. 1988).\nHere, the Policy was negotiated and entered into in the District of Columbia. Plaintiff s\nprincipal place of business and primary residence were in the District of Columbia at the time he\naccepted the Policy. (See D.l. 87 at 13-14) (citing id. Ex. 2 at 10) Although some of MAlC's\nperformance occurred in Florida - as the insurance coverage applied to Plaintiffs boating\n^ Plaintiff argues in a footnote that, even if the Court concludes Florida law does not govern, it\nshould apply the \"public policy exception\" (D.l. 95 at 14 n.l4), a \"narrow exception\" to the lex\nloci contractus rule. Roach, 945 So. 2d at 1164. The Court disagrees. The exception requires\nboth a Florida citizen in need of protection and a paramount Florida public policy. See id. at\n1165. In the context of insurance contracts, the insurer must also be on reasonable notice that the\ninsured is a Florida citizen. See id. Plaintiffs argument fails for at least the reason that he\ncannot satisfy these citizenship-related requirements. He has admitted he is \"not a Florida\nresident\" and that his primary residence and principal place of business are in the District of\nColumbia. (See D.L 87 at 13-14) (citing id. Ex. 2 at 10) The address and telephone number\nlisted on his initial application suggest the same.\n10activities there - MAIC's performance largely took place in Delaware, where it investigated the\ndamage to the Vessel. Further, the Vessel is currently in Delaware. Consideration of these\nfactors suggests that either the District of Columbia or Delaware has the most significant\nrelationship with the transaction at issue. The fact that the Vessel was kept in Florida for seven\nmonths of the year (see Tr. at 22) or that Stokes was in Florida when he negotiated and received\nthe Endorsed Policy does not alter this conclusion. As Judge Altonaga stated, the \"center of the\nalleged [claims], related parties, and the community with the most interest in the matter is not the\nSouthern District of Florida.\" (D.I. 87 at Ex. 2 at 11) (emphasis added)'^\n2. PlaintifPs Tort Claims\nThe parties agree that state law, rather than federal admiralty law, governs PlaintifPs tort\nclaims for negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, and fraud.\nMAIC maintains that three jurisdictions have legitimate interests in this litigation: the\nDistrict of Columbia (where the Policy was executed and where Plaintiff resided at the time he\napplied for the Policy), Maryland (where Plaintiffs insurance agent is located and where the\nVessel was moored), and Delaware (where the Vessel sank). (D.I. 87 at 14-15) MAIC contends\nthat there is a true conflict among these states as to whether Plaintiff may plead his tort claims\nconcurrently with his breach of contract claim. ^ (Id at 16-17)\nAs with the proposition cited earlier in this opinion, the Court is not bound by Judge Altonaga's\nholding. But it is persuaded by, and agrees with, it.\n^ In Delaware and the District of Columbia, a tort claim may be sustained concurrently with a\ncontract claim only if it is based on conduct distinct from the conduct underlying the breach of\ncontract claim - for example, fraudulent inducement. See, e.g., FTW Glob. Ims. Inc. v. Am.\nIndus. Partners Cap. FundIV, L.P., 2015 WL 3970908, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. June 24,2015);\nLudwig& Robinson, PLLC v. BiotechPharma, LLC, 186 A.3d 105,109-10 (D.C. 2018). In\nMaryland, by contrast, a tort claim may be maintained concurrently with a claim for breach of\ncontract if the plaintiff can prove malice. See, e.g.. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Piskor, 381 A.2d 16,\n11Plaintiff argues that Florida has a legitimate interest in the litigation and adds that other\ntrue conflicts exist among the three states with regard to attorneys' fees and costs and bad faith.\n(D.L 95 at 15)\nThe Court agrees with the parties that at least one true conflict exists. Therefore, it must\nengage in a choice-of-law analysis. Moreover, as already explained, Florida's choice-of-law\nrules apply.\nTo determine the substantive law governing tort claims, Florida applies the \"significant\nrelationships test\" outlined in the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws. See Bishop v. Fla.\nSpecialty Paint Co., 389 So. 2d 999,1001 (Fla. 1980). The following factors help guide courts\nin determining which state has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties:\n(a) the place where the injuiy occurred; (b) the place where the conduct allegedly causing the\ninjury occurred; (c) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of\nbusiness of the parties; and (d) the place where the relationship between the parties is centered.\nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145 (Am. L. Inst. 1988).\nHere, MAIC made representations regarding the purchase of the Policy to Stokes in the\nDistrict of Columbia, where the contract was created. Thus, the injury from the alleged\nmisrepresentations occurred in the District of Columbia. While the facts that the Vessel sank in\nDelaware and that Plaintiff can no longer use it in Florida are \"injuries\" in a sense {see D.L 95 at\n17 & n.l5), the injury alleged by Plaintiffs tort claims stems from MAIC's purported\nmisrepresentations, which allegedly occurred in the District of Columbia. Further, Plaintiffs\nprincipal place of business and primary residence (to which the Policy and subsequent renewals\n21-22 (Md. 1977); Nat'lMicrographics Sys., Inc. v. OCE-Indus., Inc., 465 A.2d 862, 871 (Md.\nCt. Spec. App. 1983).\n12were delivered) were in the District of Columbia at the time he accepted the Policy. As already\nnoted, the fact that Plaintiff was in Florida when he negotiated and received the Endorsed Policy\ndoes not alter the analysis. Finally, the contractual relationship between the parties was centered\nin the District of Columbia. That the Vessel was built and registered in Florida and the insurance\ncoverage applied to Plaintiffs boating activities in Florida do not outweigh the fact that the\nparties negotiated and entered into the contract in the District of Columbia, where the Policy was\nsubsequently delivered.\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the District of Columbia has the most significant\nrelationship to the occurrence and the parties, so its substantive law governs Plaintiffs tort\nclaims.\n3. FlaintifTs Claims Arising Under Florida Law\nMAIC argues that Florida has no legitimate interest in this litigation and that Florida law\nshould not govern any of Plaintiff s claims. (See D.I. 87 at 19-20) The Court agrees. As already\nexplained, the Court concludes that Florida substantive law does not govern Plaintiffs claims.\nAccordingly, and as the Court will explain in addressing Defendant's motion for sununary\njudgment, Plaintiff cannot sustain its claims arising under Florida law.\n4. Plaintiffs Procedural Arguments\nPlaintiff argues MAIC waived any objection to the application of Florida law by failing\nto raise its choice-of-law challenges in its motion to dismiss for improper venue. (D.I. 95 at 19-\n20) (citing D.I. 19) MAIC responds that, in its renewed motion to dismiss, it clearly stated that\n\"Florida law does not apply to the terms and conditions of the ... Policy pursuant to Florida's\nlex loci contractus doctrine.\" (D.I. 100 at 9) (citing D.I. 31 at 12) Further, Plaintiff has been\nwell aware of the choice-of-law provision in the Policy since it was issued (and renewed\n13annually). {Id.) The Court concludes that MAIC did not waive its right to object to the\napplication of Florida law. It initially raised its objection in its renewed motion to dismiss, and\nthen again via its choice-of-law motion, which was submitted well before the summary judgment\nstage. Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to respond to MAIC's challenges, including by filing\na response brief and being heard during the January 6,2022 hearing.\nFinally, Plaintiff notes that MAIC failed to comply with Delaware Local Rule 7.1.1,\nwhich requires nondispositive motions (such as Defendant's choice-of-law motion) to be\naccompanied by a statement by counsel for the moving party that the parties met and conferred\non the issues raised in the motion. (D.I. 95 at 20) MAIC admits the parties did not meet and\nconfer, but insists that any attempt to reach agreement would have been futile; it also observes\nthat Plaintiff was already on notice of MAIC's position regarding choice of law. {See D.I. 100 at\n9) MAIC's speculation as to the futility of meeting and conferring (though undoubtedly correct)\ndoes not excuse its failure to comply with Local Rule 7.1.1, and the Court does not condone\nMAIC's failure. {See Tr. at 12) Under the circumstances, however, deeming MAIC to have lost\nthe opportunity to ask the Court to apply the correct law to the issues in this case would be a\ndisproportionate response. The Court believes the appropriate exercise of its discretion at this\npoint in this case is to consider the choice-of-law motion and briefing - as it has - which has\nbeen helpful to the Court in undertaking the necessary task of determining the law applicable to\nthe issues presented in the dispositive motions.\n14B. Plaintiffs Daubert Motion\u00ae\nPlaintiff requests that the Court strike the reports of Defendant's experts, Robert K.\nTaylor and Matthew Schmahl, and preclude them from testifying at trial to the opinions stated in\nthose reports. Alternatively, Plaintiff seeks to limit the testimony in those reports to certain\ntopics. The Court will deny Plaintiffs motion.^\n\u00ae MAIC asks the Court to take notice that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court's Scheduling\nOrder (D.I. 69) expert deadlines on two occasions. (D.I. 102 at 1-2,12 n.3) First, Plaintiff filed\na supplemental disclosure of its rebuttal expert, Mr. Hains, on May 17,2021, two days past the\ndeadline. Plaintiff points out, however, that the deadline fell on a Saturday and, so, \"rolled\" to\nMonday, May 17. (D.l. 103 at 3 n.8)\nSecond, Plaintiff served a written report by Mr. Hains on Jime 15, thirty days after the\ndeadline for rebuttal experts. (D.l. 102 at 2) Plaintiff responds that this was a timely filed\n\"reply\" report, contending it was Defendant who strayed from the schedule and caused confusion\nby filing its expert disclosures simultaneously with Plaintiff on March 15. (D.l. 103 at 3-4)\nMAIC seems to be asking the Court to strike Mr. Hains' report, arguing Plaintiff \"willfully\ndisregarded\" the Scheduling Order, adding that it is unfairly prejudiced because it never had a\nchance to depose Mr. Hains. (See D.l. 115 at 7-8)\nThe Court will deny this request. There is no evidence that Plaintiff willfully disregarded\nthe Scheduling Order. Further, MAIC had the opportunity to raise its discovery disputes and\ntimely object to Mr. Hains' testimony, yet it waited until the dispositive motions stage to bring\nits concerns to the Court. (See D.l. 102 at 12 n.3)\nFor its part. Defendant faults Plaintiff for filing its Daubert motion and opening brief in\nan untimely manner, specifically 22 minutes and 25 minutes past the deadline, respectively. {See\nid. at 7 n.l) Plaintiff responds that it had difficulty uploading the documents because the file size\nof Mr. Schmahl's report was originally over the file size limit, until Plaintiff compressed it. {See\nD.l. 103 at 1 n.l) The Court questions the wisdom of bring such a complaint to the Court's\nattention.\nAs should be clear from other portions of this opinion {see, e.g., supra n.l (Defendant's\nfiling of statement of facts) & Part 11LA.4 (Defendant's failure to meet and confer)), neither\nparty has been perfect in complying with its procedural obligations. While unfortunate, these\ndeviations from proper procedures do not come close to justifying the relief each party seeks as a\nconsequence.\n^ Plaintiff contends that Eleventh Circuit law should apply, since the case was transferred from\nthe Southern District of Florida. {See Tr. at 43) The Court agrees, instead, with Defendant and\n151. Robert K. Taylor\nPlaintiff does not appear to challenge the qualifications of Mr. Taylor, Defendant's\nengineer and naval architect expert. (See D.I. 103 at 6) (Plaintiff describing Defendant's\narguments defending Taylor's qualifications as \"misplaced\") To the extent Plaintiff is making\nany such challenge, the Court agrees with Defendant that Taylor is qualified. (See D.I. 102 at 3)\n(citing Taylor's 48 years of experience as naval architect and mechanical engineer)\nPlaintiffs motion principally concerns the reliability of the tests used by Taylor to\nsupport his opinions, conclusions, and testimony. (See D.I. 103 at 6) Taylor conducted a \"float\ntest\" (placing the Vessel back onto the water to see if it floats) to determine the waterline of the\nboat, and a \"leak test\" (spraying water directly into the deck hatch) to determine whether the\nhatch was weathertight or watertight. (D.I. 99 Ex. A; see D.I. 99 at 5) Plaintiffs rebuttal expert.\nDrew Mains, testified that neither of these tests was conducted in accordance with industry\nstandards and both, therefore, do not provide reliable support for Taylor's conclusions. (D.I. 99\nEx. C at 2-4) Among the challenged conclusions are Taylor's opinions that the Vessel's\ndrainage system was not compliant with industry criteria, that the deck hatch was neither\nwatertight nor weathertight, and that these design defects were the proximate cause of the\nVessel's sinking. (See D.I. 99 at 14-18)\n\"As long as an expert's scientific testimony rests upon good grounds, based on what is\nknown, it should be tested by the adversary process.\" United States v. Mitchell, 365 F.3d 215,\n244 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[A]n expert opinion must be based on\nwill apply Third Circuit law, as issues regarding the admissibility of evidence are procedural.\n(See id. at 45; D.I. 102 at 7 n.2) In any event. Plaintiff concedes that Third Circuit law is\n\"unlikely to stray from any other circuit or district's interpretation of Daubert or the associated\nFederal Rules\" (D.I. 103 at 5), including that of the Eleventh Circuit (see Tr. at 43).\n16reliable methodology and must reliably flow from that methodology and the facts at issue - but it\nneed not be so persuasive as to meet a party's burden of proof or even necessarily its burden of\nproduction.\" Heller v. Shaw Indus., Inc., 167 F.3d 146,152 (3d Cir. 1999).\nTaylor's methodology and opinions meet these standards, notwithstanding Plaintiffs\ncriticisms. As Defendant explains, Taylor personally inspected the boat, both in and out of the\nwater. (D.I. 102 at 15) He \"took measurements, photographs, and performed both a float test\nand spray tests.\" (Id.) Using the resulting data, he calculated the boat's displacement weight and\nwaterline. (Jd.) After serving a report, he sat for a nearly five-hour deposition, explaining his\ntesting process (see id. at 3; Tr. at 44), providing Plaintiff information it could have used to try to\nreplicate his testing.\nPlaintiffs allegations, based almost entirely on its own expert's opinion, that Taylor\nemployed improper methodology, do not persuade the Court that Taylor's testimony should be\nstricken. (See D.l. 102 at 11) (noting Plaintiff failed to provide authority establishing that non-\nreliability can be established by opposing expert's counter opinion) Plaintiffs attacks on Taylor\ngo to the weight his opinions may (or may not) be given by the factfinder; they do not provide a\nmeritorious basis to prevent the opinions from being admitted. Taylor will be subject to cross-\nexamination and Plaintiff will be permitted to present its competing evidence, including its own\nexpert witness. (See generally Tr. at 44)\nFor all of these reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiffs motion.\n2. Matthew Schmahl\nAs to Mr. Schmahl, Defendant's marine surveying expert. Plaintiff primarily takes issue\nwith the portions of his report that appear to address causation. (See D.l. 103 at 9; Tr. at 42-43)\nIn Plaintiffs view, these opinions fall outside of Schmahl's expertise as a marine surveyor, are\n17duplicative of Taylor's opinions, address irrelevant issues, and are worded in a confusing\nmanner. (See D.I. 99 at 19) The Court disagrees.\nSchmahl has nearly 40 years of experience in marine surveying, particularly in \"scope of\ndamage surveys, cost of repair appraisal pricing, [and] cause of loss evaluations\" on boats. (D.I.\n102 at 16; see also Tr. at 50) In this case, Schmahl opines as to whether damage to the many\nindividual component parts of the Vessel was caused by submersion or not. (See Tr. at 46-47)\nHis opinions are relevant to the issue of damages and not duplicative of Taylor's more general\ncausation opinions. Nor is the Court persuaded that the language Schmahl uses will be confusing\nto the factfinder. (See id. at 47)\nPlaintiff further argues that Schmahl's report does not provide the basis for the\ncomponent prices scoped by him. (See D.l. 99 at 11) MAIC, however, points to an excerpt from\nthe first page of the report, explaining the labor rate and material pricing utilized. (D.l. 102 at\n16)\nIn short. Plaintiffs criticisms go to the weight and not admissibility of Schmahl's\nopinions. Schmahl's testimony will aid the jury in understanding prevailing market rates for\nmaterials and labor, information which is not within the ordinary understanding of a juror. (See\nid. at 17) Plaintiffs motion is denied.\nC. Defendant's Summary Judgment Motion\nDefendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff s claims, advancing several\ntheories in support. The Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendant's motion.\n181. Breach of Contract\nDefendant argues that, as a matter of law, it did not breach the Policy because (1) the loss\nwas not fortuitous or accidental, (2) a design defect was the efficient proximate cause of the loss,\nand (3) the Vessel was unseaworthy, in violation of the Policy's express warranty of\nseaworthiness, rendering the Policy void.\nAs to the first argument, the Policy includes a sudden accidental damage clause, which\nstates: \"We will cover sudden accidental direct physical loss or damage to the insured\nwatercraft.\" (D.I. 87 Ex. 4 at 43) The Policy does not define \"accidental,\" but the parties appear\nto agree it is synonymous with \"fortuitous.\" (See Tr. at 6) To determine who bears the initial\nburden on this issue, the Court must first decide whether to apply federal admiralty law or D.C.\nlaw, which turns on whether there are established principles or precedents of federal admiralty\nlaw governing fortuity.\nAs the fortuity rule is a well-established principle of federal admiralty law, the Court\nagrees with Defendant that federal admiralty law governs this issue. See Chartis Prop. Cas. Co.\nV. Inganamort, 2019 WL 1277518, at *2-3 (D.N.J. Mar. 20,2019), aff'd, 953 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.\n2020). \"Federal courts sitting in admiralty have been applying some variation of the fortuity rule\nin marine insurance cases for over a hundred years.\" Youell v. Exxon Corp., 48 F.3d 105,110\n(2d Cir.), cert, granted, judgment vacated on other grounds, 516 U.S. 801 (1995). Under the\nfortuity rule, \"all-risk policies in marine insurance contracts only cover losses caused by\nfortuitous events.\"\u00ae Id. The insured bears the burden of showing a fortuitous loss, although this\n\u00ae The parties do not dispute that the Policy is an \"all-risk\" insurance contract. (See, e.g., D.l. 114\nat 9) \"[A] typical 'all-risk' policy, by its terms, states that it covers any kind of loss from any\nexternal cause as long as it is not specifically excluded.\" Doherty v. Allstate Indem. Co., 2017\nWL 1283942, at *14 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 6, 2017), aff'd, 734 F. App'x 817 (3d Cir. 2018).\n19burden is \"not a particularly onerous one.\" Great Lakes Ins. SE v. Wave Cruiser LLC, 499 F.\nSupp. 3d 1191,1198 (S.D. Fla. 2020).\nA loss is fortuitous when it was \"unforeseen, unexpected, unintended, unavoidable, or\ncaused by the insured's own negligence.\" Id. at 1197. By contrast, a loss is not fortuitous if it\nresults from \"intentional misconduct of the insured, [an] inherent defect in the object damaged,\nfraud, [or] normal wear and tear.\" Id. at 1198.\nCourts have considered \"heavy rainfall\" to be a \"fortuitous event for purposes of\nrecovery under an all-risk policy.\" Chartis, 2019 WL 1277518, at *3. Plaintiff contends that\nextreme rains and weather from Hurricane Michael caused the Vessel to sink, and that the\nevidence Plaintiff has submitted satisfies his initial burden to show the loss was fortuitous.\nFor example. Plaintiff points to statements made by Defendant's post-loss inspector,\nJonathan IClopman, who confirmed that a \"thunderstorm passed through the marina between\n11:00 PM and midnight,\" and \"[t]he total rainfall for this time period was 7.29 inches.\" (D.I.\n108 Ex. E at 4) By Klopman's account, \"[t]his is an extreme amount of rainfall by any\nmeasure.\" {Id.) When asked whether a rainfall of seven inches in the span of an hour or two is a\nnormal amount of rain. Defendant's claims adjuster, Justin Evenson, responded, \"[n]o, I would\nnot say that's a normal amount of rain,\" adding \"[tjhat's an excessive amount of rain.\" (D.I. 108\nEx. D at 51) Plaintiff also points to local weather station rain collection datasets that, in\nPlaintiffs view, show an \"extreme\" amount of rainfall in a short period of time. (D.I. 108 Ex.\nG) Finally, Plaintiffs expert, Charles Stephens, opines that \"the [Vjessel's sinking was caused\nby an excessive amount of rain from Hurricane Michael.\" (D.I. 114 Ex. A at 1) Stephens came\nto that conclusion after inspecting the Vessel and location of the loss multiple times and\nreviewing meteorological information, among other data. {See id.)\n20Defendant counters that Plaintiff fails to connect most of the evidence on which he relies\nto the Vessel's submersion. (D.I. 115 at 3-4) It points out that none of its own experts,\nrepresentatives, or claims adjusters have opined that the rainfall was so extreme that it caused the\nVessel's submersion. In fact, Mr. Klopman testified: \"if you have one boat that... mysteriously\nsinks ... and no one else sank, usually it's not an act of God.\" (D.l. 105 Ex. 11 at 128-29)\nDefendant also argues that the opinion of Stephens - that the rainfall caused the Vessel to sink -\nis \"an impermissible legal conclusion.\" (D.I. 105 at 7)\nIn Defendant's view, design defects were the proximate cause of the loss, eliminating\ncoverage. See Great Lakes, 499 F. Supp. 3d at 1198. Defendant points to testimony from its\nexpert, Taylor, who opines that the Vessel had a number of design defects, leaving it \"not\ncapable of staying afloat in heavy rain, as would be reasonably expected.\" (D.l. 105 Ex. 8 at 18)\nTaylor observes that the Vessel was not built in compliance with guidelines established by the\nAmerican Boat and Yacht Council or International Organization for Standardization and that its\nmanufacturer was not certified by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. (Id. Ex. 9 at\n17-21) Taylor concludes that the Vessel would not have sunk had it been designed and built to\nminimum industry performance requirements for cockpit drainage. (Id. Ex. 8 at 13-14,16-17)\nKlopman echoes this opinion, concluding that \"[t]he loss was the direct result of improper design\nand construction.\" (Id. Ex. 3 at 10)\nUnder federal maritime law, the standard for determining causation is efficient proximate\ncause. That is, \"'the proximate cause is the efficient cause and not a merely incidental cause\nwhich may be nearer in time to the result.'\" N.H. Ins. Co. v. Krilich, 387 F. App'x 940,942\n(11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Lanasa Fruit S.S. & Importing Co. v. Universal Ins. Co., 302 U.S. 556,\n562 (1938)). Courts consider the \"predominant or determining cause,\" and where two causes\n21appear to exist, courts consider the cause that rendered the loss \"inevitable.\" Cont'l Ins. Co. v.\nLone Eagle Shipping Ltd. (Liberia), 952 F. Supp. 1046,1061-62 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff'd, 134\nF.3d 103 (2d Cir. 1998).\nHere, the record demonstrates a genuine dispute of material fact as to the efficient\nproximate cause of the Vessel's sinking. While the record contains ample evidence of \"extreme\"\nrainfall, it does not conclusively establish that such rainfall rendered the loss \"inevitable.\" Both\nsides have presented evidence sufficient to persuade a reasonable factfinder of the correctness of\ntheir view of the cause for the Vessel's sinking. Whether the loss is covered by the Policy turns\non which side is found to be correct as to the cause of the loss. Accordingly, summary judgment\nfor Defendant is not warranted.\nAs a separate argument for summary judgment, MAIC argues that the Vessel was\nunseaworthy at the inception of the Policy - in violation of the Policy's express warranty of\nseaworthiness - making the Policy void. Under federal admiralty law, where an insured\nbreaches an express warranty of seaworthiness, the entire contract is void ab initio. See State\nNat'llns. Co. v. AnzhelaExplorer, Z.Z.C., 812 F. Supp. 2d 1326,1366 (S.D. Fla. 2011). Where\na vessel sinks while moored in calm waters, or where the vessel's equipment breaks under\nnormal use, there is a rebuttable presumption of unseaworthiness. See, e.g., In re Sea Star Line,\nLLC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178293, at *30 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 23,2016). Given the evidence that\nHurricane Michael inflicted unusually heavy rains and winds on the Vessel, MAIC is not entitled\nto a presumption of unseaworthiness.\nThe insurer bears the burden of establishing that a vessel was unseaworthy at the moment\nthe policy attached. See Axis Reinsurance Co. v. Resmondo, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122778, at\n*16 (M.D. Fla. May 8,2009). Here, the record demonstrates a genuine dispute of material fact\n22as to whether the Vessel was seaworthy at the inception of the Policy. Again, summary\njudgment is not warranted.\nDefendant also seeks summary judgment that it did not breach any duty to \"adjust\"\nPlaintiff's claim. (See D.I. 105 at 17) Citing Black's Law Dictionary, MAIC contends that \"[t]o\n'adjust' means 'to determine the amount that an insurer will pay an insured to cover a loss,\"'\ninsisting it \"has engaged in activities\" that meet this definition. (Id.) MAIC, however, does not\ndescribe which \"activities\" it engaged in that could be considered \"adjusting,\" and does not\nrespond to Plaintiffs complaint that it failed to \"issue a coverage determination for 1,043 days.\"\n(D.I. 114 at 18) There is, again, a genuine dispute of material fact, which precludes a grant of\nsummary judgment.\nIt follows from the Court's conclusion as to Plaintiffs breach of contract claim that the\nCourt must also deny MAIC's summary judgment motion directed to Plaintiffs request for\ndeclaratory relief (Count II). The two counts are closely related, and Defendant has not provided\nany separate briefing or argument specific to the declaratory relief claim.\n2. Tort Claims\nMAIC seeks summary judgment on Plaintiffs tort claims.\nThe Court has already found that D.C. law govems the tort claims. Under D.C. law, tort\nclaims may be sustained concurrently with a breach of contract claim only if they are based on\nconduct distinct from the conduct underlying the breach of contract claim. See e.g., Ludwig, 186\nA.3d at 109-10. Plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation and fraud claims do not satisfy this\nrequirement. These claims stem from MAIC's \"duty to make truthful representations in all\naspects of coverage\" and are directly connected to MAIC's alleged denial of coverage that forms\na basis for the breach of contract claim. (See, e.g., D.I. 1-1 ITf 73-80, 91-97) As pled, the duties\n23MAIC owed to Plaintiff flowed from the parties' contractual relationship and were not\nindependent of the contract.\nBy contrast, the fraudulent inducement claim (Count V), based on conduct leading up to\nthe procurement of the contract, is independent of the breach of contract claim. See Ludwig, 186\nA.3d at 111. D.C. law, therefore, does not bar Plaintiff from bringing this claim concurrently\nwith his breach of contract claim.\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss Plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation (Count IV)\nand fraud (Count VII) claims, as he cannot sustain them under D.C. law.\n3. Claims Lying in Fraud or Estoppel\nDefendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain a\nverdict in Plaintiffs favor on three tort claims which lie in fraud and on his estoppel claim.\nMAIC contends that the record contains no evidence that MAIC engaged in material\nmisrepresentations or omissions, or that Plaintiff relied on such misrepresentations or omissions.\n(D.1.105 at 18) Because, as explained above, the Court is dismissing Plaintiffs negligent\nmisrepresentation and fraud claims, the Court considers MAIC's argument only as to Counts V\n(fraudulent inducement) and VI (estoppel).\nPlaintiffs position is that MAIC represented that fortuitous losses would be covered\nunder the Policy, Plaintiff relied on this position to his detriment, and MAIC later changed this\nposition by \"positing that Plaintiff s policy is ineffectual.\" (D.I. 114 at 19) These arguments\nreveal that Plaintiffs claims are just different manifestations of the parties' disputes as to\nwhether the loss is fortuitous, whether any policy exception applies, and whether the loss is\ncovered under the Policy. The Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to produce\nsufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could find for Plaintiff on the fraudulent\n24inducement or estoppel claims. (See D.I. 105 at 19-20) He cannot prove, for example, that\nMAIC made a material misrepresentation or omission. Thus, the Court will grant MAIC's\nmotion for sununary judgment as to these claims.\n4. Claims Arising Under Florida Law\nThe Court agrees with MAIC that Plaintiff's claims under Florida law (Counts HI & VIII)\nshould be dismissed, as Florida law does not govern. (See D.I. 105 at 20) Additionally, as\nPlaintiff has agreed. Count VIII - relating to mediation - is moot because the parties have\nalready mediated. (See Tr. at 68)\nIn light of the Court's conclusion that Florida law does not govern PlaintifP s claims.\nPlaintiff will be permitted leave to amend to add analogous claims under D.C. law, if it wishes\nand if it believes it has a good faith basis to do so (taking account of the Court's rulings). (See\nD.I. 114 at 20 n.23) In providing Plaintiff this opportunity, the Court has considered\nDefendant's failure to meet and confer before filing its choice-of-law motion, which deprived\nPlaintiff of the opportunity at that time to consider dropping its Florida law claims and trying to\nadd D.C. law claims. (See Tr. at 28-29) The Court finds that the best exercise of its discretion\nunder the circumstances is to permit Plaintiff limited leave to amend.\nD. PlaintifTs Summary Judgment Motion\nPlaintiff seeks summary judgment that MAIC breached the Policy for failing to pay for a\nfortuitous loss that undisputedly occurred during the time the Policy was in effect. (See D.I. 108\nat 9-12) The Court has already determined that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to\nthe cause of the Vessel's sinking. Determining the proximate cause of the loss - whether it was\nextreme rain or a design defect - is necessary to decide whether the loss was fortuitous. Thus,\nfor essentially the same reasons the Court gave in denying Defendant's largely mirror-image\n25motion for summary judgment, the Court also denies Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment\nthat MAIC breached the Policy.\nNext, Plaintiff argues Defendant cannot meet its burden to establish that Plaintiffs\ndamages are excluded (an issue that will only become ripe if Plaintiff first meets its burden to\nshow a fortuitous loss). Plaintiff asserts that, because the Policy does not include \"anti-\nconcurrent cause\" language, Defendant cannot rely on any exclusions. {Id. at 13) In this\ncontext, according to Plaintiff, the \"concurrent causation\" doctrine applies, which provides that\n\"when there are two ... or more causes of loss, the policyholder's claim is covered as long as the\nimmediate or proximate cause of loss is covered by the policy.\" Colella v. State Farm Fire &\nCas. Co., 407 F. App'x 616, 622 (3d Cir. 2011).\nDefendant correctly notes, however, that Plaintiff relies solely on cases not involving\nmaritime insurance policies or admiralty law. {See D.I. 112 at 7) As MAIC argues, in maritime\ncases, the \"efficient proximate cause\" standard applies regardless of whether the insurance policy\nincludes \"anti-concurrent cause\" language. {See id. at 5-7) (citing St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins.\nCo. V. Lago Canyon, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142202, at *17-19 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 6,2008)\n(determining that doctrine of efficient proximate cause \"is the appropriate standard to be applied\nto determine whether a loss is covered imder a marine insurance policy\")) To obtain the\ndamages it seeks, then, Plaintiff will have to prove its theory that extreme rain was the efficient\nproximate cause of the loss; that is, it will not be sufficient if Plaintiff proves only that a\nfortuitous event and an excluded event caused its loss. Accordingly, this portion of Plaintiff s\nmotion will be denied.\nPlaintiff also seeks summary judgment on MAIC's twelve affirmative defenses. {See D.I.\n116 at 7) Plaintiff faults the affirmative defenses for being \"conclusory\" - and then devotes no\n26more than one or two sentences to each defense. (D.I. 108 at 14-15) Plaintiff provides no\nmeaningful legal analysis or discussion of the factual record (which the Court must take in the\nlight most favorable to Defendant). Accordingly, this portion of Plaintiffs motion will be\ndenied.\nFinally, Plaintiff argues that MAlC's post-loss payments and actions are admissions that\nthe loss is covered under the Policy. (Jd. at 16-17) In Plaintiff's view, MAIC treated the loss as\n\"salvage ownership\" of the Vessel. {Id. at 17) It contends that MAIC retained care, custody, and\ncontrol of the Vessel after it sank; ordered that it be raised, salvaged, and transported to a\ndifferent marina (of MAlC's choosing); and authorized work to be done on the Vessel. {Id. at\n16-17) Plaintiff contends that MAlC's payments for wreck removal, storage, and other expenses\noccurring as a result of the loss are an admission of coverage. {Id. at 17) For these reasons, in\nPlaintiffs view, the Court should at least grant summary judgment as to coverage, even if the\namount of damages remains in dispute. {Id. at 19)\nIn seeking this relief. Plaintiff relies on the Policy's \"Protect and Recover\" clause, which\nstates: \"[i]n the event of a covered loss to the insured watercraft, you (Stokes) must protect the\ninsured watercraft from further loss and make every effort to recover it. We (MAIC) will pay the\nreasonable costs you incur under this condition.\" (D.l. 108 Ex. B at 8) Plaintiff contends that,\n\"[ujnder the plain and unambiguous language of the [PJolicy, the need to 'protect' the damaged\nVessel only arises 'in the event of a covered loss.'\" (D.l. 108 at 16)\nThe Court will deny this portion of Plaintiff s motion. As Defendant correctly notes, the\nlanguage Stokes relies on in the \"Protect and Recover\" clause refers to Stokes^ post-loss duties;\nit does not impose on MAIC a need to protect a damaged Vessel that arises only in the event of a\n27covered loss. (D.L 112 at 17; see also Tr. at 55 (Plaintiff conceding that \"you\" in first sentence\nof clause refers to insured))\nNor is the Court persuaded by Plaintiff's contention that the cases it cites (see D.I. 108 at\n18-19) stand for the broad notion that \"admission of coverage occurs when an insurer pays for\nnecessary repairs for damages.\" (Tr. at 80) Instead, as MAIC contends, the cases on which\nPlaintiff relies can be distinguished on numerous grounds, including that in the instant case\nMAIC has denied liability and has not paid anything directly to Stokes. (See D.I. 112 at 17-18;\nsee also Tr. at 87)\nMAIC has never admitted the loss is covered. (D.I. 112 at 15) To the contrary, its Rule\n30(b)(6) witness, Katherine Christodoulatos, explained that it is \"not unusual while the claim is\nstill being investigated that [MAIC] may cover sue and labor, storage expenses while the claim is\nbeing investigated and again, that is without prejudice.\" (D.I. 108 Ex. A at 104-05) MAIC also\npoints to its November 12,2018 reservation of rights letter, in which it reserved the right to\ninvestigate and handle Plaintiffs claim without prejudice.^ (See D.I. 112 at 16) Relatedly, a\n\"Defense\" clause in the Policy reflects an understanding that MAIC \"may investigate and settle\nany claim or suit at [its] discretion.\" (D.1.108 Ex. B at 10; see also Tr. at 75-76) Finally, MAIC\ndenies that it took \"salvage ownership,\" noting that the title of the Vessel remains with Plaintiff.\n(D.1.112 at 17)\nWhile MAIC could have taken steps to convey more clearly its position as to coverage -\nfor example, issuing a reservation of rights before making any payments or billing Stokes as it\nmade payments (see Tr. at 58, 61) - its failure to do so does not conclusively establish liability.\n^ Plaintiff notes that MAIC issued this letter after making payments; however, the letter applies\nto any actions taken \"before or after the date of th[e] Letter.\" (See D.I. 108 at 17; D.L 112 at 16)\n28Plaintiff has not met its burden to demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute of material\nfact as to whether MAIC's payments and conduct are an admission of coverage. Accordingly,\nthe Court will deny PlaintifPs motion for summary judgment,\nrv. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons explained above, the Court will deny Plaintiffs Daubert motion. The\nCourt will deny MAIC's motion for summary judgment as to PlaintifFs breach of contract claim\nand request for declaratory relief, and will grant the portions of this motion as to Plaintiffs tort\nclaims, estoppel claim, and its remaining claim arising under Florida law.
