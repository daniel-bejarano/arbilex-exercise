JOHNSON,\nPlaintiff,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-108-CFC\nENTERPRISE RENT A CAR, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nRobert W. Johnson, Watertown, New York. Pro Se Plaintiff.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nJuly 5, 2022\nWilmington, Delaware\nCONNOLLY, Chist Kaige:\n\nPlaintiff Robert W. Johnson appears pro se and has been granted leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis. (D.|. 6) He commenced this action alleging violations of his\ndue process rights. (See D.I. 2-1 civil cover sheet). The Court proceeds to screen the\nComplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for\nscreening purposes. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir.\n2008). Plaintiff alleges discrimination and attempt to extort him by Defendant\nTransworld System Inc. (D.I. 2) He alleges that Enterprise Rent A Car falsified billing\ndocuments and violated his right to due process. (/d.) There is no prayer for relief, but\nthe civil cover sheet indicates that Plaintiff seeks $100,000,000.\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening\nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d Ball v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.\n2013). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take\nthem in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515\nF.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because\nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \u201chowever\ninartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings\n\ndrafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94 (citations omitted).\n1\nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See\nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490\nU.S. 319, 331 (1989)); see also Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 112\n(3d Cir. 2002). \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only where it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably\nmeritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual\nscenario.\u201d Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d at 374 (quoting Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n530 (2003) and Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327-28).\n\nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant\nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before\ndismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the Court\nmust grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint unless amendment would be\ninequitable or futile. See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d at 114.\n\nA complaint may be dismissed only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court\nconcludes that those allegations \u201ccould not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\u201d Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). Though \u201cdetailed factual allegations\u201d\nare not required, a complaint must do more than simply provide \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Davis v.\nAbington Mem\u2019! Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In addition, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as\n\ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Williams v. BASF\n2\nCatalysts LLC, 765 F.3d 306, 315 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009) and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Finally, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient\nto show that a claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574\nU.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not be dismissed for imperfect statements of the legal\ntheory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 10.\n\nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take\nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that,\nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth;\nand (3) assume the veracity of any well-pleaded factual allegations and then determine\nwhether those allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v.\nLane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and quotations\nomitted). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that\nthe plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).\nDeciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext-specific task that requires the\nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d /d.\n\nIll. DISCUSSION\n\nTo the extent Plaintiff intended the Complaint to raise civil rights claims under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the allegations are deficient. To prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff\nmust show that a person (or persons), acting under color of law, deprived him of a\nconstitutional right. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981), overruled on other\ngrounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986); Thomas v. Tice, 948 F.3d 133,\n138 (3d Cir. 2020). There are no allegations that either Defendant is a state actor. In\n\naddition, the Complaint does not indicate where or when the alleged wrongful acts\n3\noccurred. Finally, it is not clear why the complaint was filed in this Court, given there\nare no allegations that any wrongful act occurred in the District of Delaware.\nAccordingly, the Complaint will be dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The Court finds amendment futile.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss the Complaint pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).. Amendment is futile.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nROBERT W. JOHNSON,\nPlaintiff,\nV. Civil Action No. 22-108-CFC\nENTERPRISE RENT A CAR, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nORDER\n\nAt Wilmington this Fifth day of July in 2022, for the reasons set forth in the\nmemorandum opinion issued this date;\n\nIT IS ORDERED that:\n\n1. The Complaint is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).\nAmendment is futile.\n\n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE the case.\n\nChief fw\u201d\n"}
