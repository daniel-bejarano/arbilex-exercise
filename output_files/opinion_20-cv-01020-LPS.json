INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Lakshmi Arunachalam (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d), who proceeds pro se, commenced this action on\nJuly 29, 2020. (D.I. 2) She filed an Amended Complaint on May 11, 2021, and it is the operative\npleading. (D.I. 170) \u2018The Amended Complaint asserts jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n(federal question) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity of citizenship).\u2019 Before the Court are Defendants\u2019\nmotions to dismiss and Plaintiff's opposition. (See D.I. 179, 186, 189, 191, 193-96, 198-99, 202-06,\n210-12, 215-17, 221, 223, 226, 234-35) For the reasons explained below, Defendants\u2019 motions will\nbe granted. All of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are deficient \u2014 many for multiple reasons.\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff describes herself as \u201ca 73 year-old disabled elder female citizen of color of Asian\notigin,\u201d \u201cborn a Hindu, now a member of the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints for 25 years.\u201d\n(D.1. 170 at Ff 139, 150, 338) She brings this action against 46 defendants that include corporations,\nattorneys, and federal judges,\u2019 as well as 100 unnamed Doe Defendants. The 102-page Amended\nComplaint contains 14 claims for relief generally related to patent infringement, court rulings against\nPlaintiff, constitutional violations, discrimination, defamation, and violations of other various federal\nand state laws.\n\nDefendants International Business Machines Corporation (\u201cIBM\u201d), JPMorgan Chase and\n\nCo.

Plaintiff alleges she is the inventot of the Internet of Things (IoT),\nwas awarded dozens of patents by the U.S. Government, and has not had her day in coutt in over\n100 cases. (D. I. 170 at {ff 139, 155) Plaintiff alleges she has been \u201cfinancially injured in the order\nof trillions of dollats by the largest heist of the century of het intellectual property by corporate\n\ninfringers who signed [non-disclosure agreements] with her in 1995 without paying royalties.\u201d (Id. at\n4161) She alleges that numerous corporate Defendants have substantially benefitted financially and\nin terms of their growth by their continued, unlicensed use of her intellectual property. (Id)\nPlaintiff complains of coutt rulings, actions by attorneys, judges and \u201cdefamatory\u201d orders that\ncharacterize her as a frivolous, malicious, or vexatious litigant. (Id. at {[ 114)\n\nThe 14 Counts can be summarized as follows: Count 1 against all Defendants for violation\nof the First Amendment, retaliation; Count 2 against all Defendants for violation of the Fifth\nAmendment, retaliation; Count 3 against all Defendants for violation of the First Amendment\nfreedom of speech and Right to Petition the Government for Redress of Grievances Clause; Count\n4 against all Defendants fot violation of the First Amendment, free exercise of religion; Count 5\nagainst all Defendants for violation of the Fifth Amendment, procedural due process; Count 6\nagainst all Defendants for unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act\n(\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706; Count 7 against all Defendants for violation of the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb, ef seq.; Count 8 against Judge Albright,\nDavis, Exxon, Yates, and Barr for violations of the Ametican with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n12101-12213; Count 9 against all Defendants for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, anti-disctimination laws, the Civil Rights Act of 1955 (\u00a7 1981),\nAge Discrimination Act of 1975, 34 C.F.R.

(D.1.\n170 at 74-99) Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages. (D.I. 179 at 99)\n\nDefendants move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, 8(a)(2), 12(b)(1), 12(6) 2), and\n12(b)(6). Defendants also seek a pre-filing injunction, bond requitement, and a declaration that\nPlaintiff is a vexatious litigant. Plaintiff opposes.\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARDS?\n\nA. Rule 12(b)(1)\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for dismissal for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction. Under the Rule 12(b)(1) standard, a claim fails to invoke the District Court's\njurisdiction if it is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d\u201d Coulter v. Paul Laurence Dunbar Cmty. Ctr,\n685 F, App\u2019x 161, 165 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Lunderstadt v. Colafella, 885 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cit. 1989),\n\nA facial 12(b)(1) challenge, which attacks the complaint on its face\nwithout contesting its alleged facts, is like a 12(b)(6) motion in\nrequiting the court to consider the allegations of the complaint as\ntrue. But a factual 12(b)(1) challenge attacks allegations underlying\nthe assertion of jurisdiction in the complaint, and it allows the\n\ndefendant to present competing facts. When considering a factual\nchallenge, the plaintiff has the burden of proof that jurisdiction does\n\n3 Because dismissal is wattanted on several other grounds, the Court does not address dismissal\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 or 12()(4) or (5) for improper service, insufficient process, ot\ninsufficient service of process.\n\n4\nin fact exist, the court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself\nas to the existence of its power to hear the case, and no presumptive\ntruthfulness attaches to the plaintiffs allegations. And, when\nreviewing a factual challenge, a court may weigh and consider\nevidence outside the pleadings. Therefore, a 12(b)(1) factual\nchallenge strips the plaintiff of the protections and factual deference\nptovided under 12(b)(6) review.\nHartig Drag Co. Inc. v. Senju Pharm. Co., 836 F.3d 261, 268 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal citations and\nquotation marks omitted).\n\nB. Rule 12(b)(2)\n\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), the court may dismiss a suit for lack of\njurisdiction over the person. When a defendant challenges a court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction\nunder Rule 12(b)(2), \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction by a\npreponderance of the evidence and must do so by \u2018establishing with reasonable particularity\nsufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\u201d Turner v. Prince Georges Cty. Pub. Sch.,\n694 F. App\u2019x 64, 66 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Mellon Bank (East) PSFS, Nat'l Ass\u2019 v. Farino, 960 F.2d\n1217, 1223 (3d Cit. 1992)). Upon a defendant\u2019s challenge to the Coutt\u2019s exercise of personal\njutisdiction, a plaintiff may satisfy this burden \u201cthrough sworn affidavits or other competent\nevidence;\u201d reliance on pleadings and allegations alone is insufficient. Patterson v. Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, 893 F.2d 595, 603-04 (3d Cir. 1990). Whete the Coutt has not held an evidentiary\nhearing, \u201cthe plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction and. . . is\nentitled to have its factual allegations taken as true and all factual disputes drawn in its favor.\u201d Miller\nYacht Sales, Ine. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 3d Cir. 2004).\n\nThere are two types of personal jurisdiction: \u201cgeneral jutisdiction\u201d and \u201cspecific\n\njurisdiction.\u201d Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915. 923-24 (2011) Gnternal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cGeneral jurisdiction\u201d encompasses complaints arising\n\n5\nfrom dealings that may be distinct from the defendant\u2019s activities in the state. See Goodyear, 564 U.S.\nat 923-24 (citing International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318); see also Daimler AG \u00bb. Bauman, 571 USS. 117, 126\n\ncee,\n\n(2014). By contrast, \u201cspecific jutisdiction\u201d encompasses only causes of action that \u201c\u2018aris[e] out of ot\nrelate[ ] to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d Id. (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,\nS.A. \u00bb. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 0.8 (1984)).\n\nTo establish personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff must produce facts sufficient to satisfy two\nrequirements by a preponderance of the evidence, one statutory and one constitutional. See Time\nShare, 735 E.2d at 66; Reach \u00a2 Assocs. P.C. v. Dencer, 269 F. Supp. 2d 497, 502 (D. Del. 2003). With\nrespect to the statutory requirement, the court must determine whether there is a statutory basis for\njurisdiction under the forum state\u2019s long-arm statute. See IMO Indus. Inc. v. Kiekert AG, 155 F.3d\n254, 259 (3d Cir. 1998); Reach & Assocs., 269 F, Supp. 2d at 502. With respect to the Constitution,\nthe court must determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction compotrts with the defendant\u2019s right to\ndue process. See id.; International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).\n\nUnder Delawate\u2019s long-arm statute, 10 Del. C. \u00a7 3104(c)(1)-(4), a court may exercise personal\n\njurisdiction over a defendant when the defendant or its agent:\n\n(1) Transacts any business ot performs any character of work\not setvice in the State;\n\n(2) Contracts to supply services ot things in this State;\n\n(3) Causes tortious injury in the State by an act or omission in\nthis State; or\n\n(4) Causes tortious injury in the State or outside of the State\nby an act or omission outside the State if the person regularly does or\nsolicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct in\nthe State or detives substantial revenue from services, or things used\not consumed in the State.\n\u201cA single transaction is sufficient to confer jurisdiction where the claim is based on that\ntransaction.\u201d Virtus Capital L.P. \u00bb. Eastman Chem. Co., 2015 WL 580553, at *11 (Del. Ch. Feb. 11,\n2015). The act of filing a Certificate of Incorporation within Delawate does not establish personal\njutisdiction. See In re General Motors (Hughes) S\u2019bolder Litig., 2005 WL 1089021, at *22 (Del. Ch. May 4,\n2005), aff'd, 897 A.2d 162 (Del. 2006). Pro hac vice admission in a Delaware Court can subject a\nlawyet to petsonal jurisdiction in Delaware for the case in which the attorney was admitted. See\nRiawh Co. Ltd. \u00bb. Oko Data Corp., 2011 WL 3563142, at *3 (D. Del. Aug. 15, 2011). ,\n\nSubsections (c)(1), ()(2), and (c)(3) of Delaware\u2019s long-arm statute confer specific\njurisdiction. Subsection ()(4) of Delaware\u2019s long-atm statute confers general jurisdiction, which\nrequires a greater extent of contacts with Delaware than does specific jurisdiction. General\njurisdiction allows the exetcise of personal jurisdiction even when the claim is unrelated to the\nforum contacts. See Applied Biosystems, Inc. v. Cruachem, Ltd. 772 F. Supp. 1458, 1466 (D. Del. 1991).\n\nIfa defendant is found to be within the reach of the long-arm statute, the Court must then\nanalyze whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process by determining\nwhether the plaintiff has demonstrated that the defendant \u201cpurposefully availed] itself of the\nptivilege of conducting activities within the forum State,\u201d such that it should \u201creasonably anticipate\nbeing haled into court thete.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen Cop. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980)\n(citations omitted). In undertaking this constitutional analysis, a federal court may exercise general\njurisdiction over a foreign corporation only when the corporation\u2019s \u201caffiliations with the State [in\nwhich suit is bought] are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render [it] essentially at home in the\nforum State.\u201d Daimler, 571 U.S. at 126 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919). With respect to specific\npersonal jurisdiction, federal courts have jurisdiction over nontesident defendants only in cases in\n\nwhich the defendants have purposefully directed activities at and established \u201cminimum contacts\n7\nwith [the forum] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair\nplay and substantial justice.\u201d International Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at 316 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). The litigation must \u201carise out of or relate to\u2019 those activities.\u201d Barger King Corp. v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985) (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, 466 U.S. at 414).\nRandom, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts are not sufficient to support jurisdiction. See World-Wide\nVolkswagen, 444 U.S, at 295; see Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475. \u201cWhether the requisite minimum\ncontacts exist is determined by examining the relationship between the defendant, the forum and the\nlitigation.\u201d Sternberg v. O'Neil, 550 A2d 1105, 1118 (Del. 1988) (citing International Shoe., 326 U.S. at\n316).\n\nCc. Rules 8 and 12(b)(6)\n\nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) requires the\nCourt to accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223\n(3d Cir. 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant\nis entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. 114 F.3d\n1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court may grant such a\nmotion to dismiss only if, after \u201caccepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and\nviewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiff is not entitled to relief\u201d Mao \u00bb. Aetna,\nIne. 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWhile Fedetal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \u201ca short and plain statement of\nthe claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u201d the complaint must also \u201cgive the defendant\nfait notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d\u201d Philips v. County of\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly \u00bb, Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. 544, 555 Gd\n\nCir. 2007). Although \u201cthis standard does not require \u2018detailed factual allegations,\u201d Rule 8 \u201cdemands\n8\ntore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d Id. (quoting Twombly,\n550 U.S. at 555); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\n\nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions. See Igbal,\n556 U.S. at 678; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim\nhas substantive plausibility. See Jobnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 (2014). A complaint may not\ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See\nid. at 10. \u201cIn evaluating a motion to dismiss,\u201d the court \u201cmay consider documents that ate attached\nto ot submitted with the complaint . . . \u2018matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim,\nitems subject to judicial notice, matters of public record, orders, [and] items appearing in the record\nof the case.\u201d Buck v. Hampton Twp. Sch. Dist., 452 F.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that \u2018taise a right to relief\nabove the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true (even if\ndoubtful in fact)\u201d Vistaulic Co. v. Tieman, 499 F.3d 227, 234 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550\nUSS. at 555). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\ncoutt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d\nIqbal, 556 US. at 678. At bottom, \u201c[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element\u201d of a plaintiff's claim.\nWilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc. 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n\u2018The Court is not obligated to accept as true \u201cbald assertions,\u201d Morse \u00bb. Lower Merion Sch.

Pennsylvania Power \u00a2\u00bb Light Co., 113 F.3d 405,\n417 (3d Cir. 1997), or allegations that are \u201cself-evidently false,\u201d Nav v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 69 (3d\nCir, 1996).\n\nBecause Plaintiff proceeds prv se, her pleading is liberally construed and her Amended\nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal\npleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Erickson \u00bb. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Personal and Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\nThe Court turns first to the issue of jurisdiction. \u201c\u2018[A] federal court generally may not rule\non the merits of a case without first determining that it has jurisdiction over the category of claim in\nsuit (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the parties (personal jutisdiction).\u201d\u201d Ev\u00e9son v. American Board of\nOrthopedic Surgery, 11 F.4% 200, 204-205 (3d Cir. 2021) (quoting Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malay. Int'l Shipping\nCorp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-31 (2007).\n\nDefendants Yates and Barr move for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction on the\ngrounds that they represented their client from a Texas office and sufficient minimum contacts do\nnot exist to vest this Court with personal jurisdiction. (D.I. 179, 180) Defendant Winn moves for\ndismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction on the grounds that he does not live or work in Delaware.\n(D.L. 189, 190) Defendant Rao* moves for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction on the grounds\nthat she resides in California, not Delaware, and the Amended Complaint is devoid of factual\n\nsupport and is incorrect when it alleges she transacts business in Delaware. (D.L 206, 209)\n\n* Rao, Culligan, Parker, and Abate all served as outside counsel for IBM. Culligan, Parker, and\nAbate do not move for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction, although neither do they concede\nthat personal jutisdiction exists over them. (See D.I. 208 at n.2)\n\n10\nDefendants Isbester and Decaite move for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction on the grounds\nthat neither of them live or work in Delaware and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (D.L. 215,\n216) Defendants Judge Albright, Judge Schroeder, Judge Craven, Judge Holte, Davis, Bolden, and\nCormier move for dismissal for lack of petsonal jurisdiction, as they ate located in Texas, California,\nand Washington, D.C. (D.I. 234)\n\n\u2018The Amended Complaint alleges that this Court \u201cpossesses proper subject matter\njurisdiction over the parties\u201d and that each of the Defendants numbered from 1 to 46 is an\nindividual or Corporation that maintains his/her/its principal place of business as listed (seemingly)\nin patagraphs 1-47 of the Amended Complaint. (D.I. 170 at {ff 51, 53) Specifically, the Amended\nComplaint alleges that Cormier, Rao, Isbester, and Sacksteder are in California; Decaire and Al-\nSalam are in Washington; Winn is in Oregon; Judge Albright, Davis, Judge Schroeder, Judge Craven,\nYates, and Batt are in Texas; and Judge Holte and Bolden are in Washington, D.C. (Id. at {{] 19, 26,\n30, 31-37, 42-44, 47) The Amended Comphint further alleges: \u201cDefendants do business in\nDelaware, Washington, D.C., New York, Texas, Washington, Oregon, California, Pennsylvania,\n\nWisconsin, Alabama, and Massachusetts, and all over the United States and at the United States\n\nSupteme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and in District Coutts in DE\n\nTX.\u201d (Id. at 458) It alleges that Rao, Al-Salam, Decaire, Winn, Sackstedet, Isbester, Yates, and Barr\nate officers of the court (ie., attorneys), transacted business in the State of Delaware, and that the\nforegoing Defendants worked for their respective clients, all of whom are corporations. (Id. at {{]\n62, 63) It specifically alleges that Barr and Yates remained silent while Judge Albright ridiculed\nPlaintiff. (Id. at 7175) It alleges that Cormier and Bolden worked, ot are working, as U.S. Attorneys\nfor the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and that DOJ resides in this District and transacts\n\nbusiness throughout the State and District of Delaware. (Id. at 64) The Amended Complaint also\n11\nalleges that Judge Albright, Judge Craven, Judge Schroeder, Judge Holte, as well as Davis, work for\nthe U.S. Judiciaty, have worked collusively with the District of Delaware, and have utilized void\notders from the Delaware District Court. (Id. at | 65) While the Amended Complaint contains\nallegations directed to the Defendants just discussed it does not specifically state where or when the\nalleged actions took place. (See zd. at J] 70, 94, 99-100, 102, 107, 114, 148, 155, 174, 175, 216, 227,\n232, 235, 240, 243, 248, 267, 272, 291, 296)\n\nWinn, Rao, Isbester, Decaire, Sacksteder, and Al-Salam filed declarations in support of their\nmotions. (D.I. 112-1, 112-2, 120, 167, 168, 209, 219, 220) Their declarations reveal that they do not\nhave sufficient minimum contacts with Delawate to satisfy the tequitements of due process\nnecessaty for this Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over them.\n\nYates and Bart ate Texas attorneys who represented Exxon as a defendant in a case filed\nagainst it by Plaintiff. They state that they have previously defended other clients (ie., not Exxon) in\nDelaware pm hac vice and that they lack sufficient minimum contacts for the purpose of personal\njurisdiction. (D.I. 180 at 5-6; D.I. 181 at 12-13) In attempting to assert a claim against Yates and\nBatt, Plaintiff appears to rely on Arunachalam v. Exxon Mobile Corp., 2019 WL 10303695 (W.D. Tx.\nJune 26, 2019). The Court takes judicial notice that the attorneys in that case were Yates and Barr\nand also that the case was filed in Texas, not in this District.\n\nJudges Albright, Schroeder, Craven, and Holte, as well as Davis, Bolden, and Cormier, argue\nthat the allegations fall short of alleging establishing this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over them.\n\nEach of these Defendants notes he or she is sued in an individual capacity\u2019 and contends Plaintiff\n\n5 Because the claims ate filed against these defendants in theit individual, rather than official,\ncapacities, personal jurisdiction over each defendant is necessary. See Z\u00e9eper v. Reno, 111 F. Supp. 2d\n484, 491 (D.N,J. 2000).\n\n12\ncannot show that any of them, in their individual capacities, transacted, conducted, or performed\nwork ot setvice in the District of Delawate, or regularly conducted or solicited business, engaged in\na course of conduct, or derived revenue from services ot things used in Delaware. These\nDefendants also obsetve the Amended Complaint contains no allegations that any of them have set\nfoot in Delaware.\n\nWith respect to those motions seeking dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\nPlaintiff opposes on the grounds that there is jurisdiction by reason of diversity of the parties. (D.I.\n235 at 5) There is not. (See supran.1) Furthermore, as discussed below, the Amended Complaint\nfails to state claims under federal law. Therefore, dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is\nappropriate.\n\nPlaintiff also opposes those motions that seek dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. She\natgues that Defendants\u2019 wrongful acts stated in the District of Delaware and then \u201cpropagated\u201d to\nmultiple courts. (D.I. 235 at 5-6) It seems she is referencing orders entered in this Court by U.S.\nDistrict Judge Richard G. Andrews in 2019 in Arunachalam v. International Business Machines Corp.,\n2019 WL 1388625 (D. Del. Mar. 27, 2019), aff'd, 989 F.3d 988 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Judge Andrews is\nnot a defendant in this action. In addition, Plaintiff provides no legal support for her novel theory.\nShe atgues that Defendants have certain minimum contacts within the forum in which this Court\nsits but provides no facts to support this claim. She asserts this Court has universal jurisdiction over\nthe alleged acts committed by Defendants \u201canywhere in the world, reserved for exceptionally setious\ncrime[s], as here, such as a concerted war on the Constitution, as here, ina concerted insurrection by\nDefendants, and crimes against humanity, hate ctime and human rights violations.\u201d (D.L. 235 at 6)\n\u201cUniversal jutisdiction is an international law doctrine\u201d that recognizes a \u201cnarrow and unique\n\nexception\u201d to the general requirement that nations have a \u201cjurisdictional nexus before punishing\n13\nextraterritorial conduct committed by non-nationals.\u201d United States v. Shibin, 722. F.3d 233, 239 (4th\nCir. 2013). It is plainly inapplicable here.\n\nEven taking Plaintiff's averments as true, the Amended Complaint does not suffice to vest\nthis Court with personal jurisdiction over the moving Defendants. As discussed above, when a\ndefendant raises a personal jutisdiction defense, the plaintiff has the burden to establish with\n\u201creasonable particularity\u201d sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum state to suppott\njurisdiction. See Provident Nat'l Bank v. California Fed. Sav, & Loan Ass\u2019n, 819 F.2d 434, 437 (3d Cir.\n1987). In response to Defendants\u2019 motions, Plaintiff did not present any competent evidence to\nmeet her burden of showing that this Court has personal jurisdiction. Her arguments ate not\nsupported by facts in the Amended Complaint or by the law she relies upon, and her allegations ate\nconclusory. Because Plaintiff has not demonstrated a basis for personal jurisdiction over the moving\nDefendants, the Court will grant their motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nB. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8\n\nThe Court now addresses other bases offered by Defendants for dismissal (including those\nDefendants who will be dismissed for lack of subject matter and/or personal jurisdiction).\n\nDismissal is appropriate as the Amended Complaint fails to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P.\n8(a)(2), which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.\u201d \u2018To avoid dismissal, allegations must not be \u201cso undeveloped that [they fail] provide a\ndefendant the type of notice of claim which is contemplated by Rule 8.\u201d Phillips, 515 F.3d at 232.\nHere, the Amended Complaint is neither short nor plain and is fat too disorganized to provide\nnotice to, and facilitate a meaningful response from, the defendants. See Boldrini v. Giovannini, 778 F.\nApp\u2019x 86, 87-88 (3d Cir. 2019). Moreover, the 102-page Amended Complaint contains conclusory\n\nallegations, allegations against individuals who are not named defendants, is confusing, and contains\n14\nlegal terminology without facts showing that Plaintiff is entitled to telief. Accordingly, dismissal\nwith respect to all Defendants is appropriate under Rule 8.\n\nCc. Rule 12(b)(6)\n\n\u2018The Amended Complaint is also subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\nclaim. Collectively, Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint does not allege enough factual\ncontent to state plausible claims, the claims are frivolous, Plaintiff is not entitled to relief, and she is\na vexatious litigant.\n\nPlaintiffs claims ate deficiently pled. While lengthy, Plaintiff's claims are not supported by\nthe facts and they ate conclusory. See Weigher \u00bb. Prison Health Services, 402 F. App\u2019x 668, 671 Gd Cir.\n2010) (stating bare allegations without sufficient facts to support them do not suffice). Merely\nreciting an element of a cause of action or making a bare conclusory statement is insufficient to state\naclaim. See Igbal, 556 U.S. at 677. In addition, it is impossible to discern which Defendants\nallegedly did what, where, ot when. Also, in many instances the Amended Complaint fails to link\nclaims to specific defendants, and constitutes impermissible group pleading. See, \u00a2.g., Sheeran v. Bhth\nShipholding S.A., 2015 WL 9048979, at *3 (D.N,J. Dec. 16, 2015) (dismissing complaint because it\n\u201cfails to sepatate out the liability for each defendant\u201d); Shaw v. Housing Auth. of Camden, 2012 WL\n3283402, at *2 (D.NJ. Aug. 10, 2012) (\u201c[E]ven under the most liberal notice pleading requirements\nof Rule 8(), a plaintiff must differentiate between defendants.\u201d).\n\nWhile the Amended Complaint fails to specify the dates for its claims, it appears from\n\nPlaintiff's pleading that some claims are time-barred, while others have been or could have been\n\n15\nraised by Plaintiff in her numerous other cases and, thus, are barred by reason of claim preclusion.\u2018\nPlaintiff has filed a staggering number of lawsuits \u2014 and, as is evident from her numerous cases, she\nis aware that the legal path available to her when a ruling is made against her in district court is to\nappeal to an appellate court.\n\nPlaintiffs claims do not meet the pleading requirements of Igba/ and Twombly and, therefore,\nit is appropriate to dismiss the Amended Complaint. She has failed to state any claim on which\nrelief may be granted. Therefore, her Amended Complaint is subject to dismissal putsuant to Rule\n12(b)(6).\n\nD. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983/ Bivens Claims\n\nDespite having dismissed all claims in the Amended Complaint due to Plaintiff's failure to\ncomply with Rules 8 and 12(b)(6) \u2014 in addition to dismissal based on lack of personal and subject\nmatter jurisdiction, as noted above \u2014 various Defendants identify multiple other deficiencies in the\nAmended Complaint. The Coutt will address these additional grounds for dismissal as well.\n\nCounts 1 through 5, 9, and 11 through 14 allege violations of numerous constitutional\namendments (First, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Fourteenth) and clauses (Right to Petition\nGovernment for a Redress of Grievances, Due Process, Security Clause, Unreasonable Seizures\nClause, Takings). In the original complaint, Plaintiff raised the constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1983. The Amended Complaint omits reference to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and, in several counts, raises\n\nthe constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. It appears that Plaintiff chose to taise the claims\n\n6 The doctrine of claim preclusion, also known as tes judicata, gives dispositive effect to a prior\njudgment if a particular issue, although not litigated, could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\nSee Blunt v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d 247, 276 3d Cir. 2014).\n\n16\nunder \u00a7 1981 after Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the original complaint atgued that Plaintiff failed\nto state claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\n\nSection 1983 is the remedial statute designed to redress deprivations of rights secuted by the\nConstitution and federal laws. See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 145 0.3 (1979); Kancher v. County of\nBucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006). \u201c{IJn 1971, the Supreme Court located an implied right of\naction for damages in the Constitution, available against officials acting under the color of federal\nlaw,\u201d commonly called a Bivens claim. Mammana v. Barben, 856 F. App\u2019x 411, 413 Gd Cir. 2021)\n(citing Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Burean of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971). Since\nthen, the Supreme Court has \u201cadopted a far more cautious coutse before finding implied causes of\naction;\u201d when asked \u201cwho should decide whether to provide for a damages remedy, Congtess or the\nCoutts[,] [t]he answer most often will be Congress.\u201d Mammana, 856 F. App\u2019x at 413 (citing Ziglar \u00bb.\nAbbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1855, 1857 (2017) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). The\nSupreme Court has recognized Bivens claims undet three scenarios: (1) Fourth Amendment search-\nand-seizute; (2) Fifth Amendment sex-disctimination; and (3) a federal prisoner\u2019s Eighth\nAmendment claim for failure to provide adequate medical treatment. See id at 414. \u201c[E]xpanding\nthe Bivens remedy is now a \u2018disfavored\u2019 judicial activity.\u201d Id. at 413 (quoting Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at\n1857).\n\nThe Amended Complaint names seven federal defendants, four of whom ate judges.\u2019 To\nstate a claim under Bivens, a claimant must show: (1) a deprivation of a right secured by the\nConstitution and laws of the United States; and (2) that the deprivation of the right was caused by an\n\nofficial acting under color of federal law. See Mahoney v. National Org. for Women, 681 F. Supp. 129,\n\n7 Judicial immunity is discussed in a later section below.\n\n17\n132 (D. Conn. 1987) (citing Flagg Brothers, Inc. \u00bb. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 155-56 (1978)). Count 11 is a\nclaim for unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment based on the alleged seizure\nof Plaintiff's patent properties without probable cause. (D.I. 170 at 95) Count 12 invokes the Fifth\nAmendment and alleges violation of the Due Process Clause and Takings Clause, claiming that\nPlaintiff's cases were dismissed because of her gender. (Id. at 96) While these two claims fall within\nthe thtee categories of recognized Bivens claims, the claims ate conclusory and do not state plausible\nclaims against any of the federal defendants. Plaintiff's patents were the subject of civil litigation \u2014\nhet dissatisfaction with the outcome of that litigation does not constitute a claim for relief.\nTherefore, the Bivens claims are not cognizable and will be dismissed.\n\nAs to the \u00a7 1983 claims, none of the named Defendants are State actors. Several are\ncotporations, many ate private attorneys, some are cutrent ot former federal attorneys or fedetal\nemployees and four are federal judges. To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege \u201cthe\nviolation of a tight secured by the Constitution ot laws of the United States and must show that the\nalleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d West \u00bb. Atkins, 487\nUSS. 42, 48 (1988). To act under \u201ccolor of state law\u201d a defendant must be \u201cclothed with the\nauthority of state law.\u201d Id. at 49.\n\nAs alleged, none of the Defendants are State actors. Defendants ate not State actors ot\n\u201cclothed with the authority of state law,\u201d which is fatal to Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims. See Redchley \u00bb.\nPennsylvania Dep't of Agric, 427 F.3d 236, 244-45 (3d Cir. 2005); Biener \u00bb. Calo, 361 F.3d 206, 216-17\n(3d Cir. 2004).\n\nPlaintiff attempts to overcome this deficiency by arguing, in her briefs, that Defendants ate\nState actors because they solicited and conspired \u201cwith the government to commit actions which\n\nviolate the due process clause[] of the Constitution.\u201d (D.1. 235 at 1) \u201c[A] private party who willfully\n18\npatticipates in a joint conspiracy with state officials to deprive a person of a constitutional sight acts\n\u2018under color of state law\u2019 for purposes of [section] 1983.\u201d Commonwealth of Pa. ex rel. Zimmerman v.\nPepsiCo, Inc. 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988). The Amended Complaint, however, does not allege\nthat any defendant willfully acted with a state official. Plaintiff may not amend the Amended\nComplaint through argument in her responsive brief and any new facts provided in her briefing may\nnot be considered by the Court in connection with the motions to dismiss. See generally Abbott v.\nLatshaw, 164 F.3d 141, 147-48 Gd Cir. 1998). Moreover, the allegations of conspiracy are\nconclusory and lack supporting facts. \u201cA \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim is viable only if there has been an\nactual deprivation of a constitutional right,\u201d Sweetman v. Borough of Norristown, Pa. 554 F. App\u2019x 86, 90\n(3d Cir. 2014), and Plaintiff has failed to state any plausible constitutional claim on which relief may\nbe granted. See also Monrea\u2019l v. Lamb, 2016 WL 278313, *8 (E.D. Pa. 2016) (\u201cWhen no constitutional\nviolation has been pleaded, no conspitacy claim can be maintained under \u00a7 1983.\u201d).\n\nPlaintiff argues that two federal criminal statutes support her position that Defendants are\nState actors: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, conspiracy against rights, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, deprivation of rights\nunder colot of law.\u2019 In Count 9 of the Amended Complaint, she attempts to plead a claim for\nconspiracy against rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241. Plaintiff also references 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512, a statute\nrelating to tampering with witnesses. To the extent Plaintiff relies upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 and \u00a7 242\nto establish a \u00a7 1983 or Bivens conspiracy, the claims ate not plausible. These statutes establish\ncriminal liability for certain deprivations of civil rights and conspiracy to deprive one of civil rights.\nSee Shabin v. Darling, 606 F. Supp. 2d 525, 538 (D. Del. 2009). Criminal charges cannot be brought\n\nunder these statutes through a private lawsuit; the statutes on which Plaintiff relies do not give rise\n\n5 The Amended Complaint makes no reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242.\n19\nto a civil cause of action. See id. Therefore, the conspiracy claim in Count 9, as well as all claims\ntaised under federal criminal statutes, will be dismissed.\n\nAdditionally, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 requires personal involvement. See, \u00a2.g., Rode v. Dellarciprete,\n845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988) (\u201cA defendant in a civil rights action must have personal\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs.\u201d); see a/so Evancho v. Fischer, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2006)\n(holding that plaintiff must show that each and every defendant was \u201cpersonally involved in\ndepriving him of his tights\u201d) (internal alterations omitted). The Amended Complaint does not\nadequately allege the personal involvement of each Defendant. Finally, the corporate defendants are\nnot \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of the statute and, therefore, they are not appropriate defendants.\nSee Brisbane v. Foodline, LLC, 2017 WL 4065973 (D. Md. May 5, 2017); see also Monroe v, Pape, 365 USS.\n167 (1961) (municipal corporation is not person subject to suit within meaning of Civil Rights Act).\n\n\u2018Thus, the Coutt will grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the claims that allege violations of\nthe United States Constitution. Amendment is futile as to these claims.\n\nE. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n\nThe Amended Complaint invokes the Civil Rights of 1866 which has been revised since its\nenactment and is codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 789 n.12 (1966).\nCounts 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 allege discrimination; retaliation; violations of the Security Clause and\nUnreasonable Seizure Clause of the Fourth Amendment; violations of tights secured by the Due\nProcess Clause and Takings Clause without just compensation of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments; violations of tights secured by the Trial by Jury Clause of the Seventh Amendment;\nand tights secured by the Excessive Fines and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the\n\nEighth Amendment.\n\n20\nThe statutory provisions of \u00a7 1981 are triggered by an attempt to contract. See Domino's\nPizza, Ine, v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 476 (2006). To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, a plaintiff\nmust allege (1) membership in a racial minority; (2) the defendant's intent to discriminate on the\nbasis of race; and (3) the discrimination concerned one or mote of the activities enumerated in\n\u00a7 1981(b). See Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001). These activities include\nmaking, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits,\nprivileges, tetms, and conditions of the contractual relationship. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(b). In\naddition, \u201c[t]o prevail [on a \u00a7 1981 claim], a plaintiff must initially plead and ultimately prove that,\nbut for tace, [she] would not have suffered the loss of a legally protected right.\u201d Comcast Corp. \u00bb.\nNational Ass\u2019 of African Am.-Owned Media, __U.S.__, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1019 (2020).\n\nThe \u00a7 1981 claims fail for a number of reasons. First, the Amended Complaint does not\nallege that Plaintiff attempted to enter into a contract with any Defendant or that Plaintiff had a\ncontractual relationship with any Defendant. Rather, Plaintiff repeatedly refers to government\nissued patent contract grants. (D.I. 170 at {J 114, 141, 152, 155, 159, 165, 174-76, 178, 182, 189,\n272, 318, 366, 380, 395, 400, 404, 410) In Arunachalam v. International Business Machines, Corp., No.\n2020-1493, Docket Entry 55 at 3 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 30, 2020), the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit stated that, in prior appeals, judges rejected Plaintiff's contention that the Patent Office was\nbarred from invalidating her patents based on the Contracts Clause and Fletcher \u00bb. Peck, 10 U.S. (6\nCranch) 87 (1810). Additionally, the \u00a7 1981 claims do not plausibly allege that race was a but-for\ncause of Plaintiff's injuries. See Comcast Corp., 140 S. Ct. at 1014-15. Rather, Plaintiff repeatedly\nalleges that disctimination occurted due to race, color, Indian accent, disability, age, gender, and\nreligion. Even as alleged, Plaintiff's race was, at most, one of several factors that led to the alleged\n\ndiscrimination.\n21\nThe Amended Complaint fails to state claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Therefore, the\nmotions to dismiss the \u00a7 1981 claims will be granted.\n\nF. Administtative Procedure Act\n\nCount 6 alleges that Defendants committed an unlawful agency action in violation of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706. The Amended Complaint fails to state a claim\nunder the APA.\n\nThe APA authorizes judicial teview of federal agency action. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (authorizing\njudicial review of \u201cagency action\u201d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1) (defining \u201cagency\u201d as \u201ceach authority of the\nGovernment of the United States\u201d); see also Karst Envtl. Educ. \u00a2> Prot., Inc. v. EPA, 475 F.3d 1291,\n1989 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201c[NJothing in the APA authorizes claims against nonfederal entities.\u201d).\n\nThete are no allegations that any defendant is a federal agency. Defendants are either\nindividuals or corporation. Moreover, Plaintiffs claims revolve around judicial proceedings and\nrulings, not administrative actions. The APA claims will be dismissed.\n\nG. Disctimination Statutes\n\nL RFRA\n\nCount 7 alleges that all Defendants violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n(\u201cRFRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb, ef seq. Plaintiff contends she was \u201cpressured and harassed... to\ncondone... FALSE OFFICIAL STATEMENTS?\u201d and that her refusal to do so \u201cwas compelled by\nMormon tenets of \u2018Thou shall not lie\u2019 and \u2018Thou shall not steal.\u201d (D.I. 170 at 4 152)\n\nRFRA prohibits the government from \u201csubstantially burden|ing] a person\u2019s exercise of\nreligion.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a). A plaintiff makes a prima facie claim under RFRA by\nestablishing the following elements: \u201c(1) a substantial burden imposed by the federal government on\n\na (2) sincete (3) exercise of religion.\u201d Mack \u00bb. Warden Loretto FCI, 839 F.3d 286, 304 (3d Cir. 2016).\n22\n\u201c{A] substantial burden exists where: (1) a follower is forced to choose between following the\nptecepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits otherwise generally available . . . versus abandoning\none of the precepts of his religion in order to receive a benefit; or (2) the government puts\nsubstantial pressure on an adherent to substantially modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\u201d\nReal Alternatives, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. Servs. 867 F.3d 338, 356 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\nUnder RFRA, \u201cgovernment\u201d means \u201ca branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and\nofficial (ot other person acting under color of law) of the United States, or of a covered entity.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 20000bb-2(1). RFRA does not apply to any of the Defendants other than the seven federal\ndefendants. The RFRA claims against the non-governmental Defendants all fail as a matter of law.\n\nAs to the federal defendants, the RFRA claims fail because the Amended Complaint does\nnot allege a substantial burden. The Amended Complaint contains no allegations that identify the\nnatute of the religious pressure and harassment or by whom it was committed. Not does it allege\nhow Plaintiffs religious exercise was substantially burdened. A thorough teading of the facts in the\nAmended Complaint does not support Plaintiff's claim of a substantial burden on her religious\nexercise. (See D.L 170 at ff] 240, 248, 272) The RFRA claims will be dismissed.\n\n2. Americans With Disability Act, Rehabilitation Act,\nAge Discrimination Act, And Title VII\n\nThe Amended Complaint raises several disctimination claims, all of which fail to state a\nclaim. Plaintiff alleges disctimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and for\nsegtegation; discrimination based on tace, teligion, color, national origin, or sex in public places and\nin public facilities and federally funded programs; and violations of anti-discrimination laws that\n\ncovet obtaining goods and services and accessing public places and facilities.\n\n23\nin particular, Count 8 is raised against Judge Albright, Davis, Exxon, Yates, and Barr for\nviolations of the Americans with Disability Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213. Plaintiff does not\nindicate under which Title of the Americans with Disability Act she proceeds (Title I, Title II, or\nTitle ITD. In Count 9, Plaintiff invokes the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355,\namended and codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 ef seq., and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\nUS.C. \u00a7 2000e.\n\nIndividual liability is not available for discrimination claims brought under Title I ot Title IT\nof the Americans with Disability Act. See Koslow v. Commonwealth of Pa., 302 F.3d 161, 178 3d Cit.\n2002) (\u201c{I}here appears to be no individual liability for damages under Title I of the ADA.\u201d);\nEmerson v. Thiel Coll. 296 F.3d 184, 189 (3d Cir. 2002) (suggesting in dicta that \u201cindividuals are not\nliable under Titles I and II of the ADA\u201d). Individual liability is possible under Title III of the\nAmericans with Disability Act but only with respect to an individual who owns, leases, or operates a\nplace of public accommodation. See Emerson, 296 F.3d at 189. None of the Defendants is alleged to\nbe such a petson.\n\nAs to claims under the Rehabilitation Act, because none of the defendants teceive federal\naid, the Amended Complaint does not state a claim against them under the Rehabilitation Act. See\nEmerson, 296 F.3d at 190;.A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 804 (3d Cir. 2007) (\u201cSuits may\nbe brought pursuant to [the Rehabilitation Act] against recipients of federal financial assistance, but\nnot against individuals.\u201d).\n\nPlaintiff also invokes Title VII and the Age Disctimination Act. These claims also fail as a\nmatter of law. Title VIL imposes liability only on employers. See Williams v. Pennsylvania Hum. Reds.\nComm\u2019n, 870 F.3d 294, 299 (3d Cir. 2017). Thete are no allegations that Plaintiff was employed by\n\nany named Defendant. In addition, neither Title VII nor the Age Discrimination Act provide for\n24\nindividual liability. See Parikh \u00bb. UPS, 491 F. App\u2019x 303, 308 (3d Cir. 2012); Sheridan v. EI. DuPont de\nNemours \u00a2 Co., 100 F.3d 1061, 1078 (3d Cir. 1996) (\u201c[W]e are persuaded that Congress did not\nintend to hold individual employees liable under Title VIL\u201d); Tyrrell \u00bb. City of Scranton, 134 F. Supp.\n2d 373, 383 (M.D. Pa. 2001) (holding Age Discrimination Act cannot suppott action for damages).\n\nIn addition, there ate no allegations that Defendants receive federal funding. The Age\nDiscrimination Act provides that \u201c\u2018no petson in the United State shall, on the basis of age, be\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under,\nany ptogram ot activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d Sindram v. Fox, 374 F. App\u2019x 302,\n305 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6102).\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the claims taised under the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, Title VIL, and the Age Discrimination Act.\n\n3. Other Claims\n\nIn Count 9, Plaintiff alleges a violation of 34 C.F.R. Part 110. This section of the Code of\nFederal Regulations applies only to entitles that receive financial assistance from the U.S.\nDepattment of Education. Thete are no allegations that any Defendants receives such financial\nassistance.\n\nCount 9 lists numerous other claims including violations of a patent statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282;\npatent prosecution history estoppel; Plaintiff's right to a neutral judge; Due Process (notice of\nhearing and opportunity to be heard); and Plaintiffs right to sue and right to use evidence in a\nlawsuit. (D.I. 170 at 81) These claims are alleged in a conclusory manner, it is far from clear against\nwhom these claims ate made, and, as discussed above, fail to meet the pleading standards of Twombly\nand Igbal.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss these claims.\n25\nH. Judicial And Quasi-Judicial Immunity\n\nJudge Albright, Judge Schroeder, Judge Craven, Judge Holte, and Davis, a clerk to Judge\nAlbright, all of whom ate sued in their individual capacities, seek dismissal on the grounds of judicial\nand quasi-judicial immunity. The Amended Complaint alleges in a conclusory mannet that Judge\nHolte lost jutisdiction and that the entire judiciary lacked jurisdiction and/or had conflicts. (D.I. 170\nat Jf 107, 186, 272, 360) In several instances, the Amended Complaint refers to judicial officers\nwho are not named defendants. (Id. at Jf 142, 152, 186, 304, 343, 359)\n\nPlaintiffs claims against Judges Albright, Schroeder, Craven, and Holte are barred by\nabsolute immunity. See Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 355-57 (1978) (explaining that judges ate\nnot civilly liable for judicial acts); Azubuko v. Royal, 443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (\u201cA\njudicial officer in the performance of his duties has absolute immunity from suit and will not be\nliable for his judicial acts.\u201d). Similarly, a clerk to a judicial officer who performs quasi-judicial\nfunctions is entitled to immunity. See Gallas v. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 211 F.3d 760, 772 (3d\nCit. 2000) (citing Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 225 (1988).\n\nWhile Plaintiff alleges that the foregoing Defendants were judges \u201cwith no jurisdiction\u201d she\ndoes so in a conclusoty manner and with no supporting facts. Other allegations indicate that the\njudges were, in fact, acting in their judicial capacities. For example, the Amended Complaint alleges\nthat during a telephone hearing Judge Albright purportedly ridiculed Plaintiff's \u201cspeech disability,\u201d\nand that he and his clerk, Davis, would not release audio transcripts and/or altered transcripts, and\nthat he enteted void orders. (D.I. 170 at ] 240) Plaintiff alleges that Judges Schroeder, Craven, and\nHolte denied her access to public facilities such as CM/ECF (the case management electronic filing\n\nsystem used by the federal judiciary), did not abide by legal precedent, made false official statements,\n\n26\nand defamed her by calling her a frivolous, malicious, or vexatious litigant (presumably in Court\norders). (Id. at {fj 248, 272)\n\nPlaintiff disagrees with numerous actions of these federal judges. Howevet, a \u201cSudge will not\nbe deprived of immunity because the action he took is in error, was done maliciously, ot was in\nexcess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear\nabsence of all jurisdiction.\u201d Figueroa v. Blackburn, 208 F.3d 435, 443-44 (3d Cir. 2000). Hence, even\nassuming the judges erred in any of their rulings, the judges remain absolutely immune. Plaintiff's\nallegations that they acted \u201cwith no jurisdiction\u201d are wholly conclusory and implausible. See alsa\ngenerally Selig v. N. Whitehall Tup. Zoning Hearing Bd., 653 F. App\u2019x 155, 158 (3d Cir. 2016) (\u201c[A]\ncuttently recused judge is not \u2018act[ing] in the clear absence of all jurisdiction\u2019 when he entets an\norder [and remains entitled to judicial immunity].\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThere is no question that Judges Albright, Schroeder, Craven, and Holte acted within thei\njurisdiction and, therefore, they ate immune from suit. In addition, Davis has quasi-judicial\nimmunity. \u2018Thetefore, all claims against them will be dismissed based upon their judicial immunity.\n\nI. Federal Tort Claims Act\n\nThe Amended Complaint alleges: \u201c[t]he tort which is the basis of this lawsuit was committed\nin Delaware; Washington, D.C.; New York; Texas; Washington; Oregon; California; Pennsylvania;\nWisconsin; Alabama, and Massachusetts, in addition to all over the world and the entire nation.\u201d\n(D.L. 170 at { 57) Plaintiff specifically alleges defamation. All seven of the federal Defendants move\nto dismiss the defamation claim and any other additional causes of action as barred by the Federal\nTort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d).\n\nThe FTCA authorizes federal district courts to heat \u201ccivil actions on claims against the\n\nUnited States, for money damages\u201d atising out of injuties \u201ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act\n27\not omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or\nemployment,\u201d if a private person in like circumstances would face liability under state law. 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1346(b)(1). The Westfall Act \u201caccords fedetal employees absolute immunity from common-law\ntort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties.\u201d Osborn \u00bb. Haky,\n549 U.S, 225, 228-29 (2007). The exceptions to this immunity ate not applicable here.\n\nAccordingly, all tort claims against the federal Defendants will be dismissed as the FTCA\nprovides them with immunity from suit.\n\nJ. Supplemental Jurisdiction\n\nCount 10 alleges defamation and libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nBecause the Complaint fails to state a federal claim and amendment is futile as to all federal claims,\nthe Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs state law claims. See 28\nUS.C. \u00a7 1367; De Asencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 342 F.3d 301, 309 (3d Cir. 2003); Shahin v. Darling, 350\n\nF. App\u2019x 605, 607 n.2 (3d Cir. 2009).\u2019\n\n9 Even were the Coutt to exetcise supplemental jurisdiction, the Amended Complaint fails to state\nany state law claims upon which telief can be granted. The claims for defamation are barred by the\nabsolute litigation privilege. See Trice v. Chapman, 2012 WL, 3762872, at *6 (D. Del. Aug. 28, 2012)\n(\u201cDelaware adhetes to the common law rule of \u2018absolute privilege\u2019 that \u2018protects from actions fort\ndefamation statements of judges, parties, witnesses and attorneys offered in the course of judicial\nproceedings so long as the party claiming the privilege shows that the statements issued as part of a\njudicial proceeding were relevant to a mattet at issue in the case.\u201d) (quoting Barker v. Huang, 610\nA.2d 1341, 1349 (Del. 1992)); see also Koch v. Pechota, 744 F. App\u2019x 105, 114 (3d Cir. 2018) (stating\nNew Jetsey\u2019s and New York\u2019s absolute litigation privilege extends immunity to defamatory\nstatements as long as they have relation to proceedings); Pack v. Middlebury Cmty. Sch., 990 F.3d 1013,\n1022 (7th Cir. 2021) (\u201cIndiana law has long recognized an absolute privilege that protects all\ntelevant statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding, regardless of the truth or motive\nbehind the statements.\u201d) (quoting Hartman v. Keri, 883 N.E.2d 774, 777 (Ind. 2008)); Woff'v. Menh,\n810 F. App\u2019x 10, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (alleged defamatory statements were protected by absolute\nlitigation privilege under Connecticut law); Saith v. Haynes \u00a2\u00bb Haynes P.C., 940 F.3d 635, 641 (11th\nCit. 2019) (slander claim barred by the absolute litigation privilege); Living Designs, Inc. \u00bb. E.I. Dupont\nde Nemours & Co., 431 F.3d 353, 372 (9th Cir. 2005) (Hawaii courts have applied absolute litigation\nprivilege in defamation actions); Secress . Ullman, 147 F. App\u2019x 636, 638 Gd 2005) (actions as private\n28\nVv. PREFILING INJUNCTION/SHOW CAUSE\n\nDefendants further move the Court for a pre-filing injunction and bond requirement for any\nfarther filings by Plaintiff. In the alternative, Defendants ask the Court to exetcise its discretion and\nenter an otder that any Defendant who Plaintiff serves with a subsequent motion or pleading is not\ntequited to respond unless directed to do so by the Coutt.\n\nPlaintiff has engaged in filing numerous lawsuits that contain frivolous legal arguments and\nthat are vexatious and abusive of the judicial process. Because of Plaintiff's vexatious actions, this\nCoutt has the power to enjoin her from filing meritless pleadings whete the pleadings raise issues\nidentical or similar to those that have already been adjudicated. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651; see also Matter of\nPacker Ave. Assoc. 884 F.2d 745, 747 (3d Cir. 1989); Yadav v. Surtees, 87 F. App\u2019x 271 (3d Cir. 2004).\nPlaintiff has previously been sanctioned in this District for het vexatious and wanton litigation\nconduct, and those sanctions were upheld on appeal. See Arunachalam v. International Business Machines\nCorp., 989 F.3d 988 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (affirming imposition of monetary sanctions and noting record\nthat amply demonstrated vexatious and wanton litigation conduct).\n\nNotwithstanding these sanctions, Plaintiff has continued her course of conduct, as evidenced\nby the instant case, in which Defendants include corporations Plaintiff has previously sued,\nattotneys who tepresented those corporations, judges who presided over the cases, judges\u2019 staff, and\nattorneys who tepresented the federal government. As explained throughout this opinion, Plaintiff's\n\nfilings and pleadings raise a gamut of specious, implausible, frivolous, and vexatious claims.\n\nmediator fall within California\u2019s absolute litigation privilege). In addition, the claim for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress is alleged in a conclusory manner without supporting facts.\n\n29\nA pre-suit injunction may well be justified. At this point, however, the Court will order the\nalternative relief suggested by Defendants: it will enter an order that any Defendant in this case upon\nwhom Plaintiff serves a motion ot pleading is not requited to respond unless directed to do so by\nthe Court. The Court will also order Plaintiff to show cause why she should not be enjoined from\nfiling any complaint, lawsuit, or petition for writ of mandamus, related to: (i) the patents she held ot\nholds, (ii) the more than 100 patent lawsuits she has filed, (iii) patent infringement, and/or (iv) any\nand all actions taken by individuals and corporations duting the course of patent litigation involving\nPlaintiff. After reviewing Plaintiff's submission and any response from any Defendant, the Court\nwill determine whether to provide Defendants any further relief.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss (D.I. 179,\n186, 189, 191, 193-96, 198-99, 202-06, 210-12, 215-17, 221, 223, 226, 234); (2) decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction; (3) order that Defendants need not respond to any further filings from\nPlaintiff unless directed to do so by the Court; and (4) order Plaintiff to show cause why she should\nnot be enjoined from future filings. Amendment is futile as to all claims.\n\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n30\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nLAKSHMI ARUNACHALAM,\nPlaintiff,\nv. Civ.
