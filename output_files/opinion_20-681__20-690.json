The Court carefully reviewed all submissions \nin connection with the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the disputed claim terms, heard oral argument (see D.I.  229) and applied the following legal standards in reaching its decision. \nI. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Claim Construction  \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \naltho ugh subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n135 S. Ct. 831, 837- 38 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill \nin the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation m arks omitted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial \nguidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim also must be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 3 of 18 PageID #: 59504 The patent specification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, \nInc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in evidence.\u201d  Markman v. We stview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d , 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic evidence, \n. . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Patent and Trademark Office] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1317. \u201c[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the i nventor limited the \ninvention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id.  \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to unde rstand, for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d  Teva , 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 4 of 18 PageID #: 59515 including expe rt and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical \naspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a particular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generate d at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer \nfrom bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id.   Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay \nbe useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201cis unlikely to result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof the patented invention, reli ance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nB. Indefiniteness  \n\u201cThe primary purpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that the claims are \nwritten in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, e.g. competitors of the patent owner, can \ndetermine whether or not they infringe.\u201d  All Dental Prodx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779- 80 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing Warner -Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton- Davis Chem. Co., \n520 U.S. 17, 28- 29 (1997)).  Put another way, \u201c[a] patent holder should know what he owns, and \nthe public should know what he does not.\u201d  Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., Ltd., 535 U.S. 722, 731 (2002).  \nA patent claim is indefinite if,  \u201cviewed in light of the specification and prosecution history, \n[it fails to] inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 5 of 18 PageID #: 59526 certainty.\u201d  Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2120, 2129 (2014).  A claim m ay \nbe indefinite if the patent does not convey with reasonable certainty how to measure a claimed \nfeature.  See Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  But \u201c[i]f such an understanding of how to measure the claimed [feature] was within the scope of knowledge possessed by one of ordinary skill in the art, there is no requirement for the specification to identify a particular measurement technique.\u201d  Ethicon Endo\u2013Surgery, Inc. v. Covidien, Inc., 796 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed. C ir. 2015). \nLike claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, but the Court must sometimes \nrender factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the ultimate issue of definiteness.  See, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int\u2019l, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also \nTeva , 135 S. Ct. at 842- 43.  \u201cAny fact critical to a holding on indefiniteness . . . must be proven \nby the challenger by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d  Intel Corp. v. VIA Techs., Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (F ed. Cir. 2003); see also Tech.  Licensing Corp. v. Videotek, Inc. , 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 \n(Fed. Cir. 2008).  \nII. THE COURT\u2019S RULING  \nThe Court\u2019s ruling regarding the disputed claim terms of the \u2019961 patent were announced \nfrom the bench at the conclusion of the heari ng as follows : \nAt issue we have nine terms from one patent, U.S. Patent No. \n6,465,961, that are the subject of dispute.  \nI am prepared to rule on all but one of the disputes.  I will not be issuing a written opinion, but I will issue an order stating my rulings.  I want to emphasize before I announce my decisions that although I am not issuing a written opinion, we have foll owed a full and \nthorough process before making the decisions I am about to state.  I have reviewed the patent in dispute.  I have also reviewed the portions of the prosecution history, the expert declarations and the other references submitted.  There was full briefing on each of the \ndisputed terms and each party submitted a technology tutorial.  We Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 6 of 18 PageID #: 59537 have also had argument here today.  All of that has been carefully \nconsidered.  \nAs to my rulings, I am not going to read into the record my understanding of cla im construction law.  I have a legal standard \nsection that I have included in earlier opinions, including somewhat recently in Roche Diabetes Care, Inc. v. Insulet Corp., C.A. No. 20-825.  I incorporate that law and adopt it into my ruling today and will a lso set it out in the order that I issue.  \nNow the disputed terms.  \nThe first term is \u201csaid enclosure being fabricated from a material substantially transparent to white light.\u201d  Plaintiff proposes that this term have its plain and ordinary meaning, which i t suggests is \u201c[t]he \nenclosure is fabricated from a material that is substantially transparent to white light.\u201d\n[2]  Defendants\u2019 proposed construction is \nthat \u201c[t]he entirety of the enclosure is fabricated from a material that is substantially transparent to white light.\u201d\n[3] \nThe crux of the dispute is whether to include Defendants\u2019 proposed \nnarrowing limitation that the entirety of the enclosure be fabricated \nfrom a material that is substantially transparent to white light.  I am not persuaded by the evide nce before me that this claim should be \nconstrued in this way.  The claim language itself does not specify that the entirety of the enclosure be fabricated from the claimed material.  And nothing in the specification requires that the entirety of the enclo sure be fabricated from a material that is substantially \ntransparent to white light.    \nI also credit the opinions of Plaintiff\u2019s expert that reading the claims \nas Defendants urge makes little sense to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  The patent\u2019s central invention is a light source, not an enclosure.  Accordingly, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the LED lights contemplated by the patent would use the same structure and implementation as then -existing non-\nLED lights.\n[4]     \nAccordingly, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s construction.  The claim does not require that the entirety of the enclosure be substantially transparent to white light.  Ultimately, whether a given enclosure is \n \n2  (D.I. 197 at 6) . \n3  (Id.). \n4  (See D.I. 199, JX00057 \u00b6 17) . Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 7 of 18 PageID #: 59548 \u201csubstantially transparent to white light\u201d shall be a fact question for \nthe jury.   \nNow, to terms two and three.  Both parties briefed these terms \ntogether and we addressed both terns together in the arguments today.  So I will address these terms together now.  \nTerm two is \u201can interior volume within said enclosure .\u201d  Plaintiff \nproposes that this term have its plain and ordinary meaning, which it proposes is \u201c[a]n interior volume is within the enclosure but does not need to be entirely within the enclosure.\u201d\n[5]  Defendants propose \nthat this term be construed as \u201c[t]he interior volume is contained inside the enclosure that is fabricated from a material that is substantially transparent to white light.\u201d\n[6]   \nTerm three is \u201ca heat sink located in said interior volume.\u201d  Plaintiff \nwould give this term its plain and ordinary meaning, which it \ncontends is \u201c[a] heat sink is a substance or device that absorbs or draws heat from another object and is in the interior volume of the enclosure, but does not need to be entire ly within the interior \nvolume.\u201d\n[7]  Defendants urge the Court to construe this term as \u201c[a] \nheat sink that is contained inside the interior volume of the enclosure.\u201d\n[8] \nThe dispute for these terms is similar:  whether the \u201cinterior volume\u201d and \u201cheat sink \u201d must be entirely within the \u201cenclosure\u201d and \u201cinterior \nvolume,\u201d respectively.  Plaintiff\u2019s construction would permit the \u201cinterior volume\u201d and \u201cheat sink\u201d to be only partially, not entirely, in the \u201cenclosure\u201d and \u201cinterior volume.\u201d   \nFor term two, I adopt Defendants\u2019 construction.  The claim language itself supports this construction.  \u201cInterior volume\u201d refers to \u201cvolume\u201d that is inside something.  I agree with Defendants that \u201cif the relevant \u2018volume\u2019 could be both inside and extend outside of \u2018the enclo sure,\u2019 then it would not be an \u2018interior volume.\u2019\u201d\n[9] \nDefendants\u2019 construction also finds support in the specification.  At column 3, lines 9 through 12, it states \u201c[t]he enclosure 101 encloses an interior volume 102 which may be a vacuum, or may contain a gas such as ordinary air, an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen, or \n \n5  (Id. at 14 ). \n6  (Id.). \n7  (Id. at 16 ). \n8  (Id.). \n9  (Id. at 19 ). Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 8 of 18 PageID #: 59559 any other desired gas.\u201d  If the \u201cinterior volume\u201d extends outside of \nthe enclosure, it would extend into space \u2013 and there\u2019d be no \npossibility of creating such a vacuum or container for  gas, as the \nspecification envisions.   \nPlaintiff argues that the Federal Circuit recognizes that \u201cwithin\u201d has a plain and ordinary meaning that does not require that an object \u201cwithin\u201d another thing be entirely within that thing.\n[10]   Of course, \nhow a wo rd is construed in one patent does not bind that word\u2019s \nconstruction in separate patents, and this dispute is a good example \nof why.  This dispute does not rest on my construction of a single \nword \u2013 \u201cwithin \u2013 but instead on what it means for \u201can interior \nvolume\u201d to be \u201cwithin said enclosure.\u201d  And I find that to be an \n\u201cinterior volume within\u201d an enclosure demands that that interior volume be entirely within that enclosure.   \nSo I construe term two according to Defendants\u2019 proposed construction, with a slight modification.  I don\u2019t see any reason to construe \u201cenclosure\u201d in this term, as I think my construction for term one is clear.  So the term will be construed as \u201cthe interior volume is contained inside the enclosure.\u201d  \nFor term three, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s c onstruction.  I first note that the \nplain and ordinary meaning of \u201cin\u201d is not \u201centirely within.\u201d  I note further that the specification, at column 4, line one through three, permits the base to act as a heat sink, eliminating the need for a separate heat s ink.  Figures 1 and 2 depict the invention with the \nbase not entirely within the interior volume, which supports Plaintiff\u2019s construction.  I don\u2019t agree with Defendants\u2019 argument that the just- referred to lines of the specification are describing an \nuncla imed embodiment.   \nAccordingly, my construction would permit the heat sink to be partially within the interior volume, which is a space entirely within \nthe enclosure.  \n \nNow, term four \u2013 \u201csaid panels on said heat sink being oriented to \nfacilitate emission of  light \u2026 in desired directions around the \nsemiconductor source light source.\u201d  \nThe parties\u2019 dispute for this term is two -fold.  First, Defendants \ncontend that this term is indefinite as to \u201cdesired directions.\u201d\n[11]  And \n \n10  (Id. at 14 (citing Cannon Rubber Ltd. v. The First Years, Inc., 163 Fed. Appx. 870 (Fed. \nCir. 2005) )). \n11  (Id. at 28 \u201330).  Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 9 of 18 PageID #: 595610 then Defendants propose that if I disagree about indefiniteness, the \nconstruction should be \u201ceach of the panels on the heat sink is oriented angularly with respect to each other in more than one direction in order to cause light from the LEDs to be dispersed around the semiconductor source  light source.\u201d\n[12]  Plaintiff \nproposes that this term be construed as \u201cThe panels on the heat sink \nare oriented to facilitate the emission of light in any desired \n(intended or predetermined) direction including the same \ndirection.\u201d[13]  \nDefendants contend  that \u201cdesired directions\u201d is indefinite because \nthe specification \u201cfails to provide any standard to determine if an accused product infringes.\u201d\n[14]  Defendants argue that a POSA \ncannot possibly determine whether a product is infringing because the specifi cation provides no external standard related to \u201cdesired \ndirections.\u201d  I disagree.   \nThe patent explains that \u201cthe invention relates to semiconductor light sources and illumination devices useful for providing visible light in order to partially or fully illuminate a space occupied by or viewed by humans, such as residential space, commercial space, outdoor space, the interior or exterior of a vehicle, etc.\u201d\n[15]   The \npatent points out that \u201c[p]rior art semiconductor light sources have \nnot been succe ssfully \u2026 used to illuminate physical spaces.\u201d[16]   \nThus, read in the context of the invention, a person of skill in the art \nwould recognize that the \u201cdesired direction\u201d would be the space \n\u201coccupied or viewed by humans.\u201d  The claimed term is not \n\u201csubjecti ve in the sense that it turns on a person's tastes or \nopinion.\u201d[17]   \u201cDesired directions\u201d provides an objective standard \nthat persons of skill of the art would understand when viewing the \nclaims in the context of the patent as a whole, and therefore the claim is not indefinite.  \u201cDesired,\u201d in the context of these claims, means \n\u201cintended\u201d or \u201cpredetermined.\u201d  \nIt also deserves noting that the claim has been challenged in Request for Inter Partes Reexamination and Request for Ex Parte \n \n12  (Id. at 31 \u201332). \n13  (Id. at 26 ). \n14  (Id. at 28 ). \n15  (\u2019961 Patent, 1:7\u201312) .  \n16  (Id. at 1:20\u201322) .  \n17  Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int'l, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 10 of 18 PageID #: 595711 Reexamination.[18]  There, parties were comfortable considering \nprior art references, and did not seem to have any trouble \nunderstanding the metes and bounds of \u201cdesired directions.\u201d  So that \nis further evidence in favor of not finding this term indefinite. \nNow as to the construction of the term.  The parties agree that there \nmust be more than one panel.  Defendants contend that these panels \nmust be oriented angularly and must emit light in more than one direction.  Plaintiff\u2019s construction would not impose these narrowing limitations.  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff\u2019s construction adds nothing t o the \nprior limitation, which reads \u201csaid heat sink having a plurality of panels on it suitable for mounting semiconductor devices thereon.\u201d\n[19]   Defendants contend that the term in question \u201cmust be \noriented in some way such that orientation of each pane l will \nnecessarily facilitate the emission of light in desired directions (i.e, more than one direction) around the semiconductor light source.\u201d   I disagree.  Plaintiff\u2019s construction does add a limitation that makes this term meaningful, as it makes clea r that the panels ought to be \noriented to facilitate illumination, something that the prior limitation does not require.   \nDefendants further contend that their construction is compelled by four words in the claim term: the plural word \u201cpanels,\u201d \u201coriented,\u201d the plural word \u201cdesired directions,\u201d and \u201caround.\u201d  Defendants argue that these words indicate \u201cthat the claim contemplates multiple panels being arranged or designed to produce light in multiple directions around the light source.\u201d   Defendants also point out that an embodiment in the patent, Figure 2, is consistent with their interpretation.  \nPlaintiff does not dispute that there must be multiple panels and that they must be arranged or \u201coriented\u201d in a certain way.  That\u2019s what \nis claimed and how the in vention works.  So the question is whether \nthe claim requires the panels be \u201coriented angularly with respect to \neach other in more than one direction\u201d so that the illumination \noccurs in more than one direction. \nHere, the specification makes clear that heat  sink faces, where the \npanels reside, \u201ccan be oriented with respect to each other at any \ndesired angle.\u201d   The word \u201cany\u201d does not require \u201cmore than one direction,\u201d the limitation present in Defendants\u2019 construction.  Nor does it require that the panels be oriented angularly.  That the patent \n \n18  (See D.I. 199, JX00026\u2013 31).  \n19  (\u2019961 Patent, 9:62\u201363) . Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 11 of 18 PageID #: 595812 contains an embodiment consistent with Defendants\u2019 construction is \nof little consequence, as courts do not import limitations on the basis that they are present in an embodiment.  I think the fact that the specificati on permits the panels to be \u201coriented with respect to each \nother at any desired angle\u201d strongly supports Plaintiff\u2019s position. \nAccordingly, I will construe the term to mean the panels on the heat \nsink are oriented to facilitate the emission of light in any  desired \n(intended or predetermined) direction including the same direction.\u201d  \nNow, terms five and seven:  \u201cLED module\u201d (term five) and \u201ca light emitting diode (LED) chip configured to output light at greater than about 40 milliwatts\u201d (term seven).  We dis cussed these together.  \nFirst, LED module .  Plaintiff proposes that it be given its plain and \nordinary  meaning, which it says is \u201cA package containing at least one LED chip or LED array.\u201d  Defendant s propose that it means \n\u201coperable self -contained device that includes at least one LED.\u201d  \nI have to s ay I am not at all clear why we are construing this term.   \nI\u2019ve been told it is not relevant to infringement and I don\u2019t really \nunderstand how it is relevant to any 112 issues.  But today during \nthe argument I asked Defendants\u2019 counsel about this term: \u201c[ w]hat\u2019s \nwrong with a \u2026 module just being a package that contains an LED, whether that is a chip or an array?\u201d  And Defendants \u2019 counsel said \n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, that\u2019s exactly what our proposal is.\u201d\n[20]  And that is \n \n20  (See D.I. 229 at  31:19\u201322   (\u201cI think if Your Honor were to go with a package that contains \nat least one LED I think that would get us where we generally \u2026 want to be .\u201d)  \nNotwithstanding agreeing to this construction multiple times , Defendants\u2019 counsel at one \npoint suggested a disagreement with the term \u201cpackage\u201d although he did not elaborate  \nfurther.  Id.  at 28:25\u201329:2.  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that \u201cpackage\u201d is appropriate.  \nAt column 1, lines 22 to 23, the specification says that \u201cin the prior art, LED\u2019s w ere \ntypically individually packaged in a module\u2026\u201d  This is the most on- point evidence in the \nspecification, and it supports Plaintiff\u2019s construction.  The specification\u2019s descriptions of \nfigures 2, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9 lend further support to Plaintiff\u2019s construction, as they either include or describe a \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201cpackage\u201d that is not necessarily self -contained or \noperable.  Further, Defendant s\u2019 expert provided some evidence that supports a \u201cmodule\u201d \nbeing a \u201cpackage.\u201d  (JX000406 \u00b6 73).  He stated that \u201c[t]he specification also references \u2018high power LED packages\u2019 and uses that phrase interchangeable with \u2018LED modules\u2019 having a certain power output.\u201d  Though the expert went on to state that \u201ca POSA would understand that the term \u2018LED modules\u2019 refers to operable, self -contained devices that \nincludes at least one LED,\u201d I think the most natural reading of the specification using \u201chigh power LED packages\u201d and \u201cLED modules having a certain power output\u201d interchangeably is that \u201cLED modules\u201d means \u201cLED packages\u201d and that \u201chigh- power\u201d refers to \u201ccertain \npower output.\u201d ).   Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 12 of 18 PageID #: 595913 essentially Plaintiff\u2019s proposal.  So given tha t agreement, I will \nconstrue \u201cLED module\u201d to mean a \u201c a package containing at least \none LED, whether that is an LED chip or LED array.\u201d  \nFor term seven, I need some more briefing.  I will talk about that in \na few minutes.  \nNext, term six \u2013 \u201ca first and second  reflective layers \u2026 serving to \nreflect light emitted by said active layer.\u201d   Plaintiff proposes that this term be construed as \u201cthe first and second reflective layers are distinct from each other and reflect light emitted by the active layer.\u201d  Defendant s\u2019 proposed construction is \u201cdistinct layers of material \nthat are intended to reflect more light emitted by said active layer than is absorbed by and transmitted through the layers of material.\u201d   \nThe fundamental disagreement concerns how to make sense of the \u201creflective\u201d term.  Defendants submitted an expert report explaining that all material reflects light, and so every material is \u201creflective\u201d in the literal sense.\n[21]  They contend that the only way to \ndifferentiate the \u201creflective layer\u201d limitation fr om the limitation with \n\u201ccladding layers\u201d is to demand that the term \u201cserving to reflect light\u201d be construed to demand that the layers reflect more light than they absorb and transmit.  Plaintiff submits that Defendants\u2019 construction is unduly narrow, not s upported by the intrinsic evidence, and \nignores other ways of differentiating the \u201ccladding\u201d limitation from the \u201creflective\u201d limitation.  \nI agree with Plaintiff.  The patent twice describes the reflective layers, but never defines the precise amount of light to be reflected in a way that supports Defendants\u2019 construction.\n[22]  Moreover, at \ncolumn 5, lines 32\u201354, the patent clearly differentiates between cladding and reflective layers, and so I don\u2019t find Defendants\u2019 claim differentiation argument persuasive.  I do, however, agree with Defendants\u2019 point that the reflective layers must reflect more than \nan insubstantial amount of light, and can\u2019t be negligible.  I think that \nPlaintiff agrees with that.   But I don\u2019t find enough support for the \nrequirement in Defendants\u2019 proposal.  \nI will construe the term to mean \u201cthe first and s econd reflective \nlayers are distinct from each other and reflect light emitted by the \nactive layer.\u201d And I think whether any accused products have or \nprior art has reflecting layers that reflect a non -negligible amount of \nlight  is a question of fact for t he jury.   \n \n21  (D.I. 199 at JX000394 \u00b6  40). \n22  (\u2019961 Patent, 7:44\u201347; 8:24- 31). Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 13 of 18 PageID #: 596014 The parties\u2019 next dispute is the ninth term briefed:  \u201cprimary heat \nsink.\u201d Defendants contend that this term is indefinite, or, if not indefinite, that it should be construed to be \u201ca heat sink which is in turn mounted to a secondary heat sink having a plurality of panels.\u201d  Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction is \u201cA first heat sink (a first \nsubstance or device that absorbs or draws heat from another object.\u201d  \nTurning first to definiteness, Defendants have not shown that the \nterm is indefinite by cle ar and convincing evidence.  Defendants\u2019 \nmain argument is that \u201c\u2018primary typically denotes particular attributes that make a structure \u2018primary\u2019 in relation to another structure,\u201d but the patent furnishes no way to determine whether a heat sink is \u201cprimary .\u201d\n[23]  As Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction \nindicates, it believes \u201cprimary\u201d means \u201cfirst\u201d and points to the claim language to make its argument.  It points out that claim 42 uses \u201cprimary heat sink\u201d but does not mention a secondary \u201cheat sink\u201d and theref ore, \u201cprimary heat sink\u201d can easily be understood as \u201cfirst \nheat sink.\u201d\n[24]   \nThe Court agrees.  A person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that \u201cprimary\u201d means \u201cfirst\u201d because the claim term does not have a second heat sink.  Therefore, searching for attributes that make the heat sink \u201cprimary\u201d would be silly, as there\u2019d be no second heat sink to compare the primary heat sink to.  Throughout the specification, embodiments contain only a single heat sink, which is consistent with \u201cprimary\u201d being  understood as \u201cfirst.\u201d\n[25] \nAnd much for those same reasons, I adopt Plaintiff\u2019s proposed \nconstruction.  A primary heat sink is \u201ca first heat sink (a first \nsubstance or device that absorbs or draws heat from another \nobject)\u201d.  As explained above, \u201cprimary heat sink\u201d is in claims without any requirement that there be a \u201csecondary heat sink,\u201d so Defendants\u2019 construction does not make sense and is rejected.  \nFinally, the tenth term that was the subject of supplemental briefing:  \u201cplurality of panels on [the hea t sink] suitable for mounting \nsemiconductor devices thereon.\u201d  The parties\u2019 proposed constructions are extremely similar.  Plaintiff proposes the plain and \nordinary meaning, which it contends is \u201ctwo or more panels on the \nheat sink, with each panel being s uitable for mounting \nsemiconductor devices thereon.\u201d  Defendants propose \u201c[t]wo or \n \n23  (D.I. 197 at 66) . \n24  (Id. at 64 ). \n25  (See \u2019961 Patent, Figs. 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9) . Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 14 of 18 PageID #: 596115 more panels on the heat sink, with each panel being suitable for \nhaving a semiconductor device mounted directly to its surface.\u201d[26]   \nThe only difference between these constructions is that Defendants\u2019 \nproposed construction imposes the limitation that the panels be suitable for having a semiconductor device mounted directly to its surface.  \nI will construe the term consistent with its plain and ordinary meaning, i.e., \u201ctw o or more panels on the heat sink, with each panel \nbeing suitable for mounting semiconductor devices thereon.\u201d  First, \nthe word \u201cdirectly\u201d appears nowhere in the claim at issue.  And nothing in the record has convinced me that there is a requirement that the panels be suitable for having a semiconductor device mounted directly to its surface.  For example, the notion that the panel be suitable for having a semiconductor device be mounted directly to its surface is contradicted by claim 42, which states in relevant part that \u201c\u2026said LED chip is surface mounted on a primary \nheat sink that is mounted on one of said panels of said heat sink.\u201d\n[27]   \nFurther, Defendants pointed me to column 4, lines 8 through 11, which states in relevant part that \u201c\u2018Surface mount\u2019 LED\u2019s mounted \ndirectly on a heat sink, or other surface.\u201d  This is a far cry from \nstating unequivocally that semiconductor devices must be mounted \ndirectly on heat sink panels.   \nAnother issue was raised during argument about what a panel is.  \nThat was not  briefed and I think that that is not a claim construction \nissue \u2013 it is an issue of fact for the jury whether what Plaintiff points \nto as a panel is one.  Defendants\u2019 counsel seemed to agree to that \ntoday. \nAs noted above, the Court deferred construing the  term \u201ca light emitting diode (LED) chip \nconfigured to output light at greater than about 40 milliwatts\u201d in claim 21, and the claims \ndepending therefrom, to permit the parties to submit additional briefs .  After further review of the \npapers submitted and t he transcript of the argument, it will construe this term  now. \nClaim 21 ultimately depends on claim 1.  Claim 1 includes the limitation \u201csaid \nsemiconductor chip being selected from the group consisting of light emitting diodes, light \n \n26  (See D.I. 210) . \n27  (\u2019961 Patent, Reexamination Certificate, 3:23 \u201325). Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 15 of 18 PageID #: 596216 emitting diode arrays, laser chips, LED modules, laser modules, and VCSEL chips.\u201d  Claim 21 \nthen adds that \u201csaid at least one semiconductor chip is a light emitting diode (LED) chip configured \nto output light at greater than about 40 milliwatts.\u201d  Plaintiff argues that the disp uted term should \nhave its plain and ordinary meaning, which it contends is \u201cat least one LED chip is capable of emitting light greater than about 40 milliwatts.\u201d  (D.I. 217 at 55; D.I. 220).  Defendants propose that the term be construed as \u201can LED that al one is capable of emitting light having power than \ngreater than about 40mW.\u201d  (D.I. 217 at 55; D.I. 219).  The parties\u2019 dispute centers on whether claim 21\u2019s \u201cLED chip\u201d encompasses both a light emitting diode and an LED array, and boils down to whether an \u201cLED chip\u201d may have more than a single light emitting diode. \nPlaintiff argues that its construction, which permits an LED chip to have multiple light \nemitting diodes, is supported by both the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence.  Claim 22, which is dependent on claim 21, states in relevant part \u201c[t]he semiconductor light source as recited in claim \n21 wherein: said LED chip is an LED array chip.\u201d  (\u2019961 Patent, Reexamination Certificate, 1:40\u2013\n42).  Plaintiff points out that if claim 21\u2019s\u201cLED chip\u201d did not include an LED array chip, claim 22 would not make sense.  Plaintiff also directs the Court to the specification\u2019s discussion of figure 4a, which uses \u201cLED\u201d to describe an LED array.  (\u2019961 Patent, 4:12\u201321).  Plaintiff contends that the presence of a Markush gr oup in claim 1 is not fatal to its construction, as claim 21 refers to an \n\u201cLED chip,\u201d not an \u201cLED,\u201d therefore encompassing both \u201cLED chips\u201d and \u201cLED array chips\u201d from the Markush group.  Moreover, Plaintiff argues that the elements within the Markush group overlap because \u201cLED array chips are a type of LED chip.\u201d  (D.I. 220 at 5). \nDefendants assert that its proposed construction, which permits an LED chip to have only \na single light emitting diode, is the only one supported by the intrinsic evidence.  Defendants \nsubmit that the patent uses \u201clight emitting diode\u201d and \u201clight emitting diode (LED) chip\u201d Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 16 of 18 PageID #: 596317 interchangeably, and therefore claim 21\u2019s \u201cLED chip\u201d should be construed to mean \u201clight emitting \ndiode,\u201d which is one of the members of claim 1\u2019s Markush group.  Defendants contend that because \nnothing in the claim language permits \u201cLED chip\u201d to encompass more than one member of that Markush group, it must refer to a \u201clight emitting diode\u201d alone and cannot refer to an \u201cLED array.\u201d  (D.I. 219 at 1\u20132).  Defendants c laim that this construction is supported by the specification\u2019s \nexamples of an \u201cLED chip,\u201d which consistently include only a single light emitting diode.  (See, e.g., \u2019961 Patent, 4:29\u20134:63).  Finally, Defendants point to the prosecution history, where Pla intiff \nsubmitted that \u201cthe single \u2018LED chip\u2019 of claim [31] produces roughly 3 times the light output as LEDs 4 of the LED lamps of Begemann,\u201d as evidence that, when viewed in light of the Begemann reference, claim 21 was referring to a chip with only a single light emitting diode.  (D.I. 199, JX000444). \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff and will adopt its construction.  As an initial matter, \u201c[c]ourt \ndecisions construe Markush clauses as meaning \u2018closed\u2019 unless other language or evidence alters \nthat meaning.\u201d  Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics Corp., 831 F.3d \n1350, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).  The presumption that Markush claims are closed to blends,  however, is not as strong as the presum ption that unlisted \nmembers of a Markush group are excluded.  See id.  For example, in Alcon Research, LTD. v. Watson Labs, Inc., the district court held that the Markush group was open to combinations of guar because \u201c\u2018guar\u2019 in this context encompasses bo th \u2018native guar\u2019 and \u2018hydroxypropyl guar,\u2019 as \nanything that is native guar or hydroxypropyl guar is also \u2018guar\u2019.\u201d  2018 WL 1805530, at *5 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2018).  As in Alcon Research LTD., the evidence here suggests that a member of \nMarkush group encompa sses another member of the group.  Specifically, the evidence shows that \n\u201cLED array\u201d chips are a subset of an LED chip, as claim 22 specifically refers to an \u201cLED array Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 17 of 18 PageID #: 596418 \nchip\u201d as the \u201cLED chip\u201d selected from claim 21.  Moreover, the specification describes an example \nof an LED array as \u201cthe LED,\u201d which is consistent with LED arrays being a subset of LED chips.  \nDefendants\u2019 evidence does not contradict Plaintiff\u2019s proposed construction, as the specification\u2019s describing chips with a single diode as \u201cthe LED\u201d or \u201cLED chip\u201d is consistent with Plaintiff\u2019s construction, which permits an \u201cLED chip\u201d to have one or more light emitting diodes.   \nBecause the evidence suggests that LED chips may encompass LED array chips, thereby \npermitting the LED chip of claim 21 to h ave multiple diodes, the Court will adopt Plaintiff\u2019s \nproposed construction.  The Court construes this term to mean \u201cat least one LED chip is capable of emitting light greater than about 40 milliwatts.\u201d  \n         \n              \n       The Honorable Maryellen Noreika  \n       United States District Judge  \n Case 1:20-cv-00681-MN   Document 230   Filed 05/10/22   Page 18 of 18 PageID #: 5965"}
