Kallenbach, \nMinneapolis, MN. \nAttorneys for Plaintiff. \nAntranig Garibian, GARIBIAN LAW OFFICES, P.C., Wilmington, DE. \nAttorney for Defendant. \nAugust 17, 2022 \n1 AND~~ TATES DIST \nBefore me is Defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) (D.I. 7) and \nPlaintiffs cross-motion for the court to set bond and compel Defendant to reissue shares pursuant \nto Plaintiff posting bond. (D.I. 17). I have reviewed the parties' briefing. (D.I. 8, 17, 20). For \nthe reasons set forth below, Defendant 's motion is GRANTED and Plaintiffs cross-motion is \nDENIED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Peter Mergenthaler filed suit against Defendant Enzolytics, Inc. (\"ENZC\") on \nAugust 11, 2021, asserting, \"[Defendant] should be ordered to reissue to [Plaintiff] 10,000,000 of \nits shares\" pursuant to 6 Del. C. \u00a7 8-405. (D.I. 1 at 1135-51, 51). \nPlaintiff states that he owns 10,000,000 shares of ENZC, but that James W. Zimbler \nengaged in a scheme to fraudulently convert Plaintiff's shares to his and others' ownership . (Id. \nat 119-26). Specifically, Plaintiff states that, beginning in 2015, Zimbler orchestrated the \nfraudulent transfer of Plaintiff's shares in ECOP, which is a predecessor corporation of ENCZ, to \nSage Market Advisors (2,500,000 shares), OMS Consulting, Inc. (1,500,000 shares), M. Lamar \nOutz (1,000,000 shares), and American Asset Management Services Corporation (5,000,000 \nshares). (Id. at 113, 22-26, 40). Zimbler owns American Asset Management Services Corporation, \nto which 5,000,000 of Plaintiff's shares were transferred. (Id. at 1126, 41 ). At the time of this \ntransfer, Zimbler was the vice president ofECOP. (Id. at 137). Zimbler resigned from his position \nat ECOP on July 6, 2015, after the conversion of Plaintiffs shares. (Id. at 38.) \nDefendant requests that this court dismiss Plaintiffs suit pursuant to Rule 12(b )( 6) for \nPlaintiff's failure to comply with 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405. (D.I. 8). In a cross-motion, Plaintiff requests \n2 that this court set a sufficient indemnity bond compliant with 6 Del. C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2) and order \nDefendant to reissue 10,000,000 ENCZ shares to Plaintiff. (D.I. 17 at 1, 7-8). \nII. LEGALSTANDARD \nRule 8 requires a complainant to provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.. .. \" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) allows the accused \nparty to bring a motion to dismiss the claim for failing to meet this standard. A Rule 12(b )( 6) \nmotion may be granted only if, accepting the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and \nviewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, a court concludes that those \nallegations \"could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.\" Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n544, 558 (2007). \n\"Though 'detailed factual allegations ' are not required, a complaint must do more than \nsimply provide 'labels and conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction.\"' Davis v. Abington Mem 'l Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 555). I am \"not required to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly \nalleged in the complaint.\" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F .3d 198, 216 (3d \nCir. 2002). A complaint may not be dismissed, however, \"for imperfect statement of the legal \ntheory supporting the claim asserted.\" See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014). \nA complainant must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has \"substantive \nplausibility.\" Id. at 12. That plausibility must be found on the face of the complaint. Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the [complainant] pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the [ accused] is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific \n3 task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" Id. \nat 679. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nI was concerned about whether I had subject matter jurisdiction (D.I. 21 ), which was \nalleged to be on the basis of diversity (D.I. 22, 23). Both sides argued that I did, but without \nciting any actual authority. The issue that I was concerned about was the relief sought\u00ad\nreissuing 10,000,000 shares of stock-did not appear to involve damages; it appeared to be \nanalogous to issuing an injunction. But it appears, not surprisingly, that similar issues have been \naddressed before, with the conclusion that the value of the shares is the measure of the amount in \ncontroversy. \"We have struggled before with the problem of determining the actual amount in \ncontroversy when plaintiffs request only declaratory or equitable relief. But here, it is clear that \nthe shares of stock themselves are at issue and that the amount in controversy therefore depends \non the value of those shares.\" Gouldv. Artisoft, Inc., 1 F.3d 544,547 (7th Cir. 1993) (citations \nomitted); see Madison Stock Transfer, Inc. v. Exlites Holdings International, Inc., 368 F. Supp. \n3d 460 (E.D. N.Y. 2019). At the time the suit was filed, it appears that ENZC stock was trading \nat about 16 cents per share, making the amount in controversy about $1,600,000. \nTo recap, the allegations are that in 2015, a third party converted Plaintiff's 10,000,000 \nshares of stock to various entities. Plaintiff learned of this in 2018. (D.I. 1at136). Plaintiff \nstarted to take some action to recover his converted stock in 2021. (Id. at 1 27). Later that year, \nhe filed this suit. Plaintiff requests that I compel ENZC to reissue the shares to him pursuant to 6 \nDel. C. \u00a7 8-405(a) \nUnder 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a), \"If an owner of a certificated security, whether in registered or \nbearer form, claims that the certificate has been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken, the issuer \n4 shall issue a new certificate if the owner: (1) so requests before the issuer has notice that the \ncertificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser; (2) files with the issuer a sufficient \nindemnity bond; and (3) satisfies other reasonable requirements imposed by the issuer.\" \nAs to the merits, the case is lightly briefed. Neither side cites a single case interpreting 6 \nDel. C. \u00a7 8-405(a) or any closely analogous statute from any other state. \nDefendant argues that this court should dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint because of Plaintiffs \n\"failing to comply with the requirements of 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405.\" (D.I. 8 at 4). Particularly, \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff failed to comply with 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2), because, \"Plaintiff \nhas not filed any indemnity bond,\" and Plaintiffs attempts to excuse himself from this failure are \nwithout support from any \"statutory provision or legal principle.\" (Id. at 5). \nIn response, Plaintiff argues that he did not need to file an indemnity bond for three reasons. \nFirst, Plaintiff argues that he did not need to file an indemnity bond because Defendant has not \nacted in good faith as is required by 6 Del C. \u00a7 1-304 and, instead, has \"refus[ed] to communicate\" \nwith Plaintiff. (D.I. 17 at 6-7). Plaintiff supports this contention based on allegations included in \nthe declaration of Mark J. Kallenbach, which Plaintiff filed with its opposition brief. (D.I. 17 at \n1-4, 6 (citing D.I. 18 (Kallenbach Declaration)); see also D.I. 1 at ,r,r27-30 (including factual \nallegations regarding the unresponsiveness of Plaintiff)). Second, Plaintiff argues that \"no \nindemnity bond should be required of [Plaintiff]\" because \"[Defendant] can seek indemnification \non [a] Kemark bond[,]\" thereby making any bond Plaintiff must file according to 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-\n405(a)(2) redundant. (D.I. 17 at 7; see also D.I. 1 at if39). Third, Plaintiff argues, \"If all of the \nprotected purchasers [including Sage Market Advisors, OMS Consulting, Inc., and M. Lamar \nOutz] have sold all of their shares, then no bond should be required.\" (D.I. 17 at 7). \n5 I find that Plaintiff failed to comply with 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2), and that this failure cannot \nbe excused for the reasons Plaintiff argues. \nAs to Plaintiffs first argument, I do not find that Plaintiff should be excused from filing an \nindemnity bond based on Defendant's alleged bad faith conduct. As a preliminary matter, I find \nthat Plaintiff did not plead sufficient factual content in his Complaint to support this argument. \n(See D.I. 20 at 2-4). Instead, in its opposition briefing, Plaintiff supports his argument by citing \nfacts included in the later-filed Kallenbach Declaration . (See D.I. 17 at 1-4, 7 ( citing D.I. 18); see \nalso Hartig Drug Co. Inc. v. Senju Pharm. Co., 836 F.3d 261,273 (3d Cir. 2016) (\"[F]or purposes \nof Rule 12(b)(6), a court must consider only the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, \nmatters of public record, as well as undisputedly authentic documents if the complaint's claims are \nbased upon these documents.\")). Moreover, the factual allegations included in Plaintiffs \nComplaint -though not cited in Plaintiffs opposition briefing -do not contain sufficient factual \nmatter to show that Plaintiff acted in bad faith in its communications with Defendant. (See D.I. 1 \nat ~~27-30; see also Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.\") (cleaned up)). \nEven considering the allegations presented in the Kallenbach Declaration as true and \nviewing them in the light most favorable to the complainant, I do not find that those allegations \nshow that Defendant acted in bad faith. Instead, in the Kallenbach Declaration, the last listed \ncommunication between the parties was sent by Defendant's counsel, where counsel indicates the \nintention to \"reconnect and have a conversation\" with Plaintiff after conferring with the client. \n(D.I. 18, Ex. G (including email sent by Defendant's counsel to the Plaintiffs counsel on July 16, \n2021)). On the current record, it is unclear whether conversations between the parties occurred \n6 after July 16, 2021. As I see it, Defendant was communicating with Plaintiff, and Plaintiff never \nraised his need to file a sufficient indemnity bond.1 For these reasons, even considering the \ndeclaration Plaintiff submitted after filing his Complaint, I find that Plaintiff failed to state a \nplausible claim that Defendant acted in bad faith in its communications with Plaintiff. \nI also note that the entire theory that good faith is relevant to the statutory requirements is \nnot based on anything in the statute. Rather, it is based on 6 Del. C. \u00a7 1-304, which states, \"Every \ncontract or duty within the Uniform Commercial Code imposes an obligation of good faith in its \nperformance and enforcement.\" Until Plaintiff meets his obligations under\u00a7 8-405(a)(2), I am not \nsure how Defendant's good faith or lack thereof is relevant. \nRegarding Plaintiffs second argument, I find no legal support that Plaintiff can avoid its \nrequirement to file a sufficient indemnity bond pursuant to 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2) based on \nDefendant's alleged ability to independently indemnify itself through a \"Kemark bond.\" (See also \nD.I. 20 at 5). For that matter, Plaintiff does not make clear what a \"Kemark bond\" is or provide \nany support for this argument beyond attorney conjecture . (See D.I. 17 at 7). Plaintiffs argument \nsimply ignores the statute. \nRegarding Plaintiffs third argument, I find that Plaintiff should not be excused from filing \nan indemnity bond because \"it is possible that all protected purchasers [sold their shares].\" (D.I. \n17 at 7; see also D.I. 20 at 5). In the Complaint, there are no allegations regarding whether the \nprotected purchasers sold their shares. But even if the protected purchases sold their shares, it \nwould not provide a legal basis for Plaintiff to fall within an exception to 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2) . \n1 While I have not done significant research, I do note that the Court of Chancery has at least \nimplied that an appropriate indemnity bond might be set at the market value of the stock. See \nCastro v. lTTCorp ., 598 A.2d 674, 682-83 (Del. Ch. 1991) (\"Assume a bond is fixed in an \namount equal to the present market value of the stock .... \"). \n7 For these reasons, I find that Plaintiff has not stated a plausible claim to relief that he \ncomplied with the requirement of 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2). \"In light of the official explanation that \nsection 8.405(b) incorporated into law the longstanding corporate practice of voluntarily reissuing \ncertificates where a shareholder had satisfied certain reasonable requirements, and the assurance \nof court-ordered relief only where reasonable requirements have been satisfied and a sufficient \nindemnity bond supplied, [I find] that a shareholder cannot compel an issuer to give him a new \ncertificate unless he has complied with all three requirements of section 8.405(b).\" Glaser v. Texon \nEnergy Corp., 702 F.2d 569, 572 (5th Cir. 1983) (cleaned up). Thus, Plaintiffs Complaint is \ndismissed without prejudice. \nIn the cross-motion, Plaintiff also argues that, if the court finds that the filing of a sufficient \nindemnity bond is required under 6 Del C. \u00a7 8-405(a)(2), \"the question becomes that of the \nappropriate bond amount, which amount is in the discretion of the Court.\" (D.I. 17 at 7-8). I \ndisagree and find no legal basis for the court to set a bond amount rather than to dismiss this \nComplaint. Presumably, Plaintiff can post an indemnity bond without a court order. \nBecause I am dismissing this Complaint for the above reasons, I need not address the other \narguments made in the parties' briefing. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED. Plaintiff's \ncross-motion is DENIED. \nAn appropriate order will issue. \n8 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPETER MERGENTHALER, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nENZOL YTICS, INC., A DELAWARE \nCORPORATION, SUCCESSOR IN \nINTEREST TO ECO PETROLEUM \nSOLUTIONS, INC., A DELAWARE \nCORPORATION, SUCCESSOR IN \nINTEREST TO STRUCTURAL \nENHANCEMENTS, INC.
