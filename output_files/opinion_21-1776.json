Pro Se Plaintiff \nEileen M. Ford, Esquire, Marks, O'Neill, O'Brien, Doherty & Kelly, P.C., Wilmington , \nDelaware . Counsel for Defendant. \nrv,ay 9, 2022 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION Case 1:21-cv-01776-VAC   Document 14   Filed 05/09/22   Page 1 of 5 PageID #: 185ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge: \nPlaintiff John Richard Rogowitz appears pro se and proceeds in forma pauperis. \nHe commenced this action on December 20, 2021. (D.I. 2). Before the Court had an \nopportunity to screen the case, Defendant filed motions to dismiss. (D.I. 10, 12). The \nCourt proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) . \nBACKGROUND \n'~\u00b7 The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes -of screening the Complaint. See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 \nF\u00b7.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). Plaintiff filed this matter as a complaint and request for \nfnjunction. (D.I. 2). He asserts this Court has jurisdiction by reason of a federal \nl:r6estion and diversity of citizenship . (Id. at 3). The civil cover sheet refers to this \nmatter as a foreclosure action. (D.I .2-2). The Complaint alleges that \"a cloud on all \ntitle activity exists due to no definitive claimant of ownership of the due notes due to \nd,lvergent paths taken by both the mortgage note and by the deed of trust.\" (D.I. 2 at 4). \nPlaintiff alleges the denial of his right to \"due process and constitutional rights per \nimproper mortgage company procedures , both servicing through an independent \n,. \nBrbker/realtor, and otherwise, and including , but not limited to, improper noticing for \nffiortgage note and deed activities .\" (Id. at 5). Plaintiff seeks compensatory and \npLnitive damages . (Id.). \nI' \\ I SCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \"the action is frivolous or malicious , fails to \n~ ate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \n1 \n> ' \n\\ . Case 1:21-cv-01776-VAC   Document 14   Filed 05/09/22   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 186defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ba// v. Famiglio, 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013). See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (in forma pauperis actions). The Court must \naccept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most \nfavorable to a prose plaintiff. Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d \nCir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). Because Plaintiff proceeds pro \nse, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint , \"however inartfully pleaded, \nfnust be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" \nbickson v:\u00b7Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94. \n/\u00b7 '. A complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nWooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366, 374 (3d Cir. 2020). \"Rather, a claim is frivolous only \nWhere it depends 'on an \"indisputably meritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless \" or \n\"fantastic or delusional \" factual scenario.\"' Id. \nJ\" The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \n\u2022\"1 \u00b7 o \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is identical to the legal standard used when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \n\u00b7motions. Tourscherv . McCullough , 184 F.3d 236,240 (3d Cir. 1999). However , before \nrsmissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \n( \nYranted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the Court must grant \nPlaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. \n\\ \nSee Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nt . . r \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions . \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 \n' .,-i' \n(2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S.10 (2014). A complaint may not \n2 Case 1:21-cv-01776-VAC   Document 14   Filed 05/09/22   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 187dismissed , however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim \nas~serted. See id. at 11 . \n,_ A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) take \n~\u00b7ote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions , are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \n\u20ac:letermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane \nConstr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \"show\" that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\"context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\" Id. \n\u20ac DISCUSSION \nThe Complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction . I have reviewed the \nt\u00b7omplaint and it does not raise a federal civil claim for violations of the United States \n6onstitution or federal statutes. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Plaintiff alleges violations of his \nright to due process and constitutional rights in a conclusory manner, yet the Complaint \n\u00a7tates no such claims. In addition, both parties are in domiciled in Delaware and, \ntherefore, there is no diversity of citizenship as required for diversity jurisdiction. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1332. \nThe Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter. Therefore, the case will be . \n~\u00b7ismissed. \n3 \nu \n{ ' ., Case 1:21-cv-01776-VAC   Document 14   Filed 05/09/22   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 188CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) dismiss as moot the pending motions \nto dismiss; and (2) dismiss the Complaint for want of jurisdiction. The Court finds \namendment futile. \nAn appropriate Order will be entered. \n4 Case 1:21-cv-01776-VAC   Document 14   Filed 05/09/22   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 189"}
