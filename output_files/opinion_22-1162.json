No. 22-1162-GBW \nCLAIRE DEMATT EIS, et al., \nDefendants. \nSean M. Gray, Sr., James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware, Pro \nSe Plaintiff. \nJanuary l 7 , 2023 \nWilmington, Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION WILLIAMS, United States District Judge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Sean M. Gray, Sr., an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional \nCenter (\"JTVCC\") in Smyrna, Delaware. (D.1. 2). Plaintiff appears prose and has \nbeen granted leave to proceed in Jonna pauperis. (D.I. 6). The Court proceeds to \nreview and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and \n\u00a7 1915A(a). \nIl. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes. See Shorter v. United States, 12 F.4th 366,374 (3d Cir. 2021). \nGray alleges the following. On July 26, 2020, there was a physical altercation in \nhis housing unit in JTVCC. Gray was not involved in the altercation. Defendant \nSgt. Keith Bums ordered all inmates to immediately return to their cells and secure \ntheir doors. However, Defendant Bums \"neglected to unlock/release the doors \nfrom the command module,\" and, as a result, the inmates \"were unable to fully \ncomply with the command.\" (D.I. 2 at 7). Gray stood next to his assigned cell, \nunable to enter. An unknown female corrections officer came into the unit and, \n\"with reckless disregard\" for all present, \"commenced to discharge a torrent of \npepper spray,\" which went directly into Gray's left eye. (Id. at 8). Approximately thirty minutes later, Gray had no \"central vision\" in his left \neye. He sought help from Defendant Burns, who told him he would be okay in \nthirty to forty minutes. Defendant Burns would not request immediate medical \nassistance. Gray submitted a sick call and was seen by a non-defendant nurse on \nJuly 28, 2020. \nGray's complaint details the treatment he received, and did not receive, over \nthe next year and a half, which he asserts constituted deliberate indifference. He \ndoes not identify anyone he interacted with regarding his eye injury during this \ntime period. Instead, he lists all named Defendants and states that they, \"by and \nthrough the various policies in their individual and collecti[ ve] efforts failed, \nrefused and neglected to get me timely medical treatment which resulted in \npermanent damage to my left eye violating the 8th Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.\" (Id. at 9). \nIII. SCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the \nscreening provisions of28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if\"the action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks \nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. \nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted); see also 28 \n2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (informa pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (civil actions \nfiled by prisoners seeking redress from governmental entities or government \nofficers and employees). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a \ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. \nSee Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224,229 (3d Cir. 2008). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \n\"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal \npleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366,374 (3d Cir. 2020). Rather, a claim is deemed \nfrivolous only where it relies on an \"'indisputably meritless legal theory' or a \n'clearly baseless' or 'fantastic or delusional' factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim \npursuant to\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l) is identical to the legal standard \nused when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d \n236,240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening \nprovisions of28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to \n3 amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See \nGrayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and \nconclusions. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that \na claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 514 U.S. 10 \n(2014) (per curiam). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 11. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) \ntake note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify \nallegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, \nassume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an \nentitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" \nthat the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that \nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" \nId. \n4 A defendant in a civil rights action \"cannot be held responsible for a \nconstitutional violation which he or she neither participated in nor approved\"; \npersonal involvement in the alleged wrong is required. Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 \nF.3d 187,210 (3d Cir. 2007); see also Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312,325 \n(1981) (holding that liability in a\u00a7 1983 action must be based on personal \ninvolvement, not respondeat superior). Such involvement may be \"shown through \nallegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge and acquiescence.\" \nEvancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347,353 (3d Cir. 2005). \"Allegations of participation \nand acquiescence ... must be made with appropriate particularity.\" Rode v. \nDellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988); see also Parkell v. Danberg, \n833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2016). \nWith the exception of Defendant Burns, the Complaint contains no \nallegations directed at any of the Defendants that are pleaded with particularity. \nGray's blanket statement about all of Defendants' alleged conduct is insufficient to \nconstitute allegations of personal involvement for purposes of a \u00a7 1983 claim. \nAccordingly, these Defendants will be dismissed from this action for failure to \nstate a claim, pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The \ndismissals will be without prejudice. See O'Dell v. United States Gov't, 256 F. \nApp'x 444, 445 (3d Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (leave to amend is proper where the \n5 plaintiffs claims do not appear \"patently meritless and beyond all hope of \nredemption\"). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: ( 1) dismiss Defendants DeMatteis, \nErskins, Records, Holsten-Jones, Akinbayo, Kaur, Ngwa, Kandash, and May, and \nthe claims against them, for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l); and (2) allow Gray to proceed against \nDefendant Burns. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n6 "}
