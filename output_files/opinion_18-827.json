{"case_name": "Deere & Company v. AGCO Corporation, et al.,", "case_number": "18-827", "judge": "Chief Judge Colm F. Connolly", "date": "05-19-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nDEERE & COMPANY,\nPlaintiff,\nVv.\nCivil Action No. 18-827-CFC\n\nAGCO CORPORATION and CONSOLIDATED\nPRECISION PLANTING LLC,\n\nDefendants.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n\nPending before me is Deere\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment of\nInfringement of Claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 8,813,663 (Motion No. 1). D.I. 329.\nIn Deere\u2019s Concise Statement of Undisputed Facts filed in support of its motion,\nDeere identifies the following fact as material to the motion and not in dispute:\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 interrogatory response admitted that SpeedTube\u2019s feeder wheels\n\u2018take seeds while held on the seed meter disc.\u201d\u201d D.I. 331 17. Deere relies on this\nasserted fact for its contention that the accused products \u201cremov[e the seed] by\ncapturing\u201d from the seed meter. See D.I. 330 at 21. In support of this statement of\nfact, Deere cites part of Defendants\u2019 interrogatory: \u201cPrecision Planting created\n\u2018feeder wheels\u2019 that take seeds while held on the seed meter disc[.]\u201d D.I. 332 at A-\n1311. Defendants dispute the conclusion to be drawn from the interrogatory\n\nresponse, explaining that the \u201cfact that the feeder wheels \u2018take seeds\u2019 from the\nmeter is irrelevant; the relevant question is how they do so, i.e., whether seeds are\nremoved by capturing\u201d and stating that \u201cSpeedTube\u2019s feeder wheels do not remove\nby capturing.\u201d D.I. 368 417. In support of this alternative conclusion, Defendants\ncite the full interrogatory answer: \u201cPrecision Planting created \u2018feeder wheels\u2019 that\ntake seeds while held on the seed meter disc and accelerate[ ] them toward the\nflights of the flighted belt.\u201d D.I. 368 \u00a7 17 (citing D.I. 332 at A-1311). Defendants\ncite additional record evidence from which a rational juror could plausibly\nconclude that a seed is removed by projection as opposed to by capture. See D.I.\n368 at 11 \u00a5 6 (citing D.I. 371, Ex. 3 at 157:16-22 (Deere\u2019s expert agreeing that the\n\u201cperiod of the seed\u2019s travel\u201d is \u201cthe time of flight of the seeds from the point of\nlosing contact with the feeder wheels to the time of making contact with the\nflighted belt\u2019\u201d)).\n\nBecause there is at least one disputed fact that Deere has said is material to: \u201c\nits motion for summary judgment, I will deny the motion. See Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (holding that summary judgment will not lie\nif there is a genuine dispute about a material fact).\n\nWHEREFORE, this Nineteenth day of May in 2022, Deere\u2019s Motion for\n\nCHI oi UDGE\n\nSummary Judgment (D.I. 329) is DENIED.\n\n"}
