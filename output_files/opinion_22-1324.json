No. 22-1324-GBW \nCENTURION LLC, \nDefendant. \nMark Franklin, James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, Smyrna, Delaware , Pro Se \nPlaintiff. \nJanuary l 7 , 2023 \nWilmington , Delaware MEMORANDUM OPINION WILLIAMS, United States District Judge: \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Mark Franklin, an inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center \n(\"JTVCC\") in Smyrna, Delaware, filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \n(D.1. 3). Plaintiff appears prose and has been granted leave to proceed informa \npauperis. (D.1. 5). In addition, Plaintiff has filed two motions to compel. (D.I. 7, \n8). The Court proceeds to review and screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) and\u00a7 1915A(a). \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \nscreening purposes. See Shorter v. United States, 12 F.4th 366,374 (3d Cir. 2021). \nFranklin broke his leg and foot while playing basketball at JTVCC. He alleges that \nhis injury was greatly exacerbated during delays in the administration of \ndiagnostics and care. \nID. SCREENING OF COMPLAINT \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the \nscreening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if\"the action is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks \nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" Ball v. \nFamiglio, 726 F.3d 448,452 (3d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (informa pauperis actions); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (civil actions \nfiled by prisoners seeking redress from governmental entities or government \nofficers and employees). The Court must accept all factual allegations in a \ncomplaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff. \nSee Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F .3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008). Because \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se, his pleading is liberally construed and his Complaint, \n\"however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal \npleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim. See \nDooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d. 366,374 (3d Cir. 2020). Rather, a claim is deemed \nfrivolous only where it relies on an \"'indisputably meritless legal theory' or a \n'clearly baseless' or 'fantastic or delusional' factual scenario.\"' Id. \nThe legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim \npursuant to\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l) is identical to the legal standard \nused when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d \n236,240 (3d Cir. 1999). However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening \nprovisions of28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 and 1915A, the Court must grant Plaintiff leave to \n2 amend his complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See \nGrayson v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA well-pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and \nconclusions. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that \na claim has substantive plausibility. See Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10 \n(2014) (per curiam). A complaint may not dismissed, however, for imperfect \nstatements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted. See id. at 11. \nA court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps: (1) \ntake note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify \nallegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \nassumption of truth; and (3) when there are well-pleaded factual allegations, \nassume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an \nentitlement to relief. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n2016). Elements are sufficiently alleged when the facts in the complaint \"show\" \nthat the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 ( quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2)). Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \"context-specific task that \nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\" \nId. \n3 Centurion is the only named defendant. When a plaintiff relies upon a \ntheory of respondeat superior to hold a corporation liable (rather than its \nemployees or agents themselves), he must allege a policy or custom that \ndemonstrates such deliberate indifference. See Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. \nFacility, 318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003) (because respondeat superior or \nvicarious liability cannot be a basis for liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a \ncorporation under contract with the state cannot be held liable for the acts of its \nemployees and agents under those theories). Ultimately, to establish that \nCenturion is directly liable for the alleged constitutional violations, Franklin \"must \nprovide evidence that there was a relevant [Centurion] policy or custom, and that \nthe policy caused the constitutional violation[s] [Franklin] allege[s].\" Natale, 318 \nF.3d at 583-84. The Complaint does not refer to any policy or custom of Centurion \nand does not set forth any constitutional violations allegedly caused thereby. \nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \n\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). However, since it appears plausible that Franklin may be able to \narticulate a claim against Centurion or other potential defendants, he will be given \nan opportunity to amend his pleading. See O'Dell v. United States Gov't, 256 F. \nApp'x 444, 445 (3d Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (leave to amend is proper where the \n4 plaintiffs claims do not appear \"patently meritless and beyond all hope of \nredemption\"). \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) deny as premature Franklin's \nmotions to compel (D.I. 7, 8); and (2) dismiss the Complaint pursuant 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Franklin will be given leave to file an \namended complaint. \nAn appropriate order will be entered. \n5 "}
