Williams", "date": "12-29-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nPFIZER INC., C.P. PHARMACEUTICALS \nINTERNATIONAL C.V., PF PRISM C.V., \nPBG PUERTO RICO LLC, and PF PRISM \nIMBB.V., \nPlaintiffs, \nV. \nSINOTHERAPEUTICS INC., \nDefendant. C.A. No. 21-1427-GBW \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nBefore the Court is Defendant Sinotherapeutics Inc.'s (\"Defendant\" or \"Sinotherapeutics\") \nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings (the \"Motion\") contending that Sinotherapeutics does not \ninfringe any claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,937,181 (\"the '181 patent\") either literally or under the \ndoctrine of equivalents. D.I. 15. The Motion has been fully briefed. D.I. 15, 22, 26. For the \nfollowing reasons, the Motion is denied. \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs Pfizer Inc., C.P. Pharmaceutical s International C.V., PF PRISM C.V., PBG \nPuerto Rico LLC, and PF PRISM 1MB B.V. (collectively \"Plaintiffs \" or \"Pfizer\") sued \nSinotherapeutics for infringement of the '181 patent based on Sinotherapeutics' filing of \nAbbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") No. 216001 seeking FDA approval to sell generic \ncopies of Pfizer's 11 mg Xeljanz\u00ae XR (tofacitinib citrate extended-release tablets) prior to the \n1 '181 patent's expiration. D.I. 1 1 1-2.1 Pfizer's 11 mg Xeljanz XR tablets are approved for the \ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Id. 1 19. \nThe active ingredient in Pfizer's Xeljanz\u00ae XR product is tofacitinib citrate. Id. 1 16. \nXeljanz\u00ae XR contains tofacitinib citrate in an amount equivalent to 11 mg of tofacitinib base in \nextended release tablets formulated for once-daily administration. Id. According to Pfizer, \nSinotherapeutics ' proposed ANDA product purportedl y contains \"extended release oral tablets \ncontaining 11 mg of tofacitinib citrate.\" Id. 1 29. However , Sinotherapeutics avers that its \n\"proposed ANDA product will not have 11 mg of tofacitinib in a core,\" which Sinotherapeutics \nexplains the '181 patent requires. D.I. 11 128, 56-57. \nAfter answering Pfizer's complaint and asserting counterclaims of non-infringement and \ninvalidity , D.I. 11, Sinotherapeutics filed the instant Motion, D.I. 15. Sinotherapeutics maintains \nthat it does not literally infringe the '181 patent because its ANDA product does not meet the \"a \ncore comprising 11 mg of tofacitinib , or an equivalent amount of [a tofacitinib salt]\" limitation \nthat is required for all claims of the '181 patent. Sinotherapeutics also argues that Pfizer cannot \nrely on the doctrine of equivalents to \"bridge the wide gap\" due to amendment-based prosecution \nhistory estoppel. D.I. 15 at 4. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nPursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , a party may move for \njudgment on the pleadings \"[a]fter pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial.\" FED. \nR. CIV. P. 12( c ). When evaluating a motion for judgment on the pleadings , the Court must \"view \n1 The instant case arises under the Hatch-Waxman Act, more formally known as the Drug \nPrice Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 \n(1984 ). The '181 patent is listed in the FDA publication , \"Approved Drug Products with \nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations \" (the \"Orange Book\") with respect to Xeljanz XR 11 mg. \nD.I. 1119-22. \n2 the facts presented in the pleadings and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party.\" Rosenau v. Unifund Corp., 539 F.3d 218, 221 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Jablonski v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 863 F.2d 289, 290-91 (3d Cir. 1988)). \n\"The purpose of judgment on the pleadings is to dispose of claims where the material facts \nare undisputed and judgment can be entered on the competing pleadings and exhibits thereto , and \ndocuments incorporated by reference .\" Venetec Int'/, Inc. v. Nexus Med., LLC, 541 F.Supp.2d 612, \n617 (D. Del. 2008); see also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d \nCir. 1997) (explaining that any documents integral to pleadings may be considered in connection \nwith Rule 12( c) motion). \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether \nthe claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" Burlington Coat Factory, 114 F.3d \nat 1420. Ultimately, a motion for judgment on the pleadings can be granted \"only if no relief could \nbe afforded under any set of facts that could be proved.\" Turbe v. Gov 't of Virgin Islands, 938 F.2d \n427, 428 (3d Cir. 1991). \nIII. DISCUSSION \nBecause Pfizer does not dispute that Sinotherapeutics ' ANDA product cannot literally \ninfringe the claims of the '181 patent, see generally D .I. 22, the Court turns to whether Pfizer may \nassert infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . Sinotherapeutics argues Pfizer is estopped \nfrom doing so based on amendment-based prosecution history estoppel. D.I. 15 at 4. \n\"[E]quivalents remain a firmly entrenched part of the settled rights protected by the patent.\" \nBio-Rad Lab'ys, Inc. v. JOXGenomics Inc., 967 F.3d 1353, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (quoting Festa \nCorp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722, 733 (2002) (\"Festa I\")). \"There \nare certain limitations , however, on a patentee's ability to obtain an infringement verdict under the \ndoctrine of equivalents . One such limitation is prosecution history estoppel.\" Bio-Rad, 967 F.3d at \n3 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (citing Festo I, 535 U.S. at 737-40). \"Prosecution history estoppel applies \nas part of an infringement analysis to prevent a patentee from using the doctrine of equivalents to \nrecapture subject matter surrendered from the literal scope of a claim during prosecution.\" Trading \nTechs. Int'!, Inc. v. Open E Cry, LLC, 728 F.3d 1309, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Prosecution history \nestoppel can occur in two ways: \"either (1) by making a narrowing amendment to the claim \n('amendment-based estoppel') or (2) by surrendering claim scope through argument to the patent \nexaminer ('argument-based estoppel').\" Amgen Inc. v. Coherus BioSciences Inc., 931 F.3d 1154, \n1159 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting Conoco, Inc. v. Energy & Envtl. Int'!, L.C., 460 F.3d 1349, 1363 \n(Fed. Cir. 2006)). \nAmendment-based prosecution history estoppel arises \"when a patent applicant narrows \nthe scope of his claims during prosecution for a reason 'substantial[ly] ... relating to \npatentability.\"' Bio-Rad, 967 F.3d at 1363 (citing Festa Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo \nKabushiki Co., 344 F.3d 1359, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (en bane) (\"Festa IF'). \"A narrowing \namendment is presumed to be a surrender of all equivalents within 'the territory between the \noriginal claim and the amended claim.\"' Id. at 1364 ( citing Festo I, 535 U.S. at 740). \"This \npresumption can be overcome if the patentee can [ satisfy an exception to prosecution history \nestoppel that] ... the rationale underlying the amendment bears no more than a tangential relation \nto the equivalent in question.\" Id. (citing Festo 1 at 74(\u00b51.1). \"The crux of the tangentiality inquiry \nremains 'the patentee's objectively apparent reason for the narrowing amendment ... [as] \ndiscernible from the prosecution history record.\"' Id. at 1365 ( quoting Festo II, 344 F .3d at 1369) \n\"[W]hether prosecution history estoppel applies, and hence whether the doctrine of \nequivalents may be available for a particular claim limitation, presents a question of law.\" Id. \n(quoting Festo II, 344 F.3d at 1367-68). In making this determination, the Court must '\"look to \n4 the specifics of the amendment and the rejection that provoked the amendment to determine \nwhether estoppel precludes the particular doctrine of equivalents argument being made.\"' Id. \n(quoting Intervet Inc. v. Merial Ltd., 617 F.3d 1282, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2010)). \nBased on the record before it, the Court does not find prosecution history estoppel \namenable to resolution in this litigation's early stage. \"Hatch-Waxman trials are almost always \nbench trials, so the Court may choose in any particular Hatch-Waxman case (and likely the vast \nmajority of them) to evaluate prosecution history estoppel at trial, as the Court will usually make \na better decision when it has a full evidentiary record and the opportunity to consider at length all \naspects of the parties' disputes.\" Almirall, LLC v. Torrent Pharms., Ltd., 548 F. Supp. 3d 443,451 \n(D. Del. 2021). \nA full record will improve the \"case-specific analysis\" required here. Bio-Rad, 967 F.3d \nat 1366. While Sinotherapeutics argues that Pfizer narrowed its claims to eventually contain the \n\"core comprising 11 mg tofacitinib\" element to overcome patentability rejections based on lack of \nwritten description, D.I. 15 at 12; D.I. 26 at 1, Pfizer maintains that its patentability arguments did \nnot concern \"the necessity of all 11 mg of tofacitinib being in the core\" but rather were \"related to \nthe PK and dissolution profiles and how there was an established correlation between the \nexcipients and structure of the osmotic formulation and the recited PK/dissolution profiles,\" D.I. \n22 at 13-15. Pfizer also maintains that, even if the Court were to find that Pfizer added the 11 mg \ndose to the claims for reasons related to patentability , Pfizer's rationale for its claim amendments \nbears no more than a tangential relation to Sinotherapeutics' Generic XR Tablets-an argument \nSinotherapeutics rejects as having \"no force.\" D.I. 22 at 15-16; D.I. 26 at 5-6. Sinotherapeutics \ndoes not dispute that expert testimony from those skilled in the art as to the interpretation of the \n5 prosecution history may help the Court understand the amendments and statements made during \nprosecution. 2 \nWhile Sinotherapeutics argues that \"prosecution history estoppel must apply\" \" to compel \na finding of noninfringement ,\" D.I. 26 at 5, it cannot be seriously disputed that \"the Court has \ndiscretion to deny a Rule 12(c) motion.\" Almirall, 548 F. Supp. 3d at 451 (citing Wright & Miller, \nSC Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1367 (3d ed. Apr. 2021) (noting that Court may postpone \ndetermination of Rule 12(c) motion until trial)). Indeed, other courts have denied Rule 12(c) \nmotions to defer resolving amendment-based prosecution history estoppel upon the development \nof a full record. 3 Sinotherapeutics cites to no authority compelling a different result. \n2 The Court has discretion to consider such testimony. Compare Festa II, 344 F.3d at 1370 \n(\"[W]hether the patentee has established a merely tangential reason for a narrowing amendment is \nfor the court to determine from the prosecution history record without the introduction of \nadditional evidence, except, when necessary , testimony from those skilled in the art as to the \ninterpretation of that record.\"); Silvergate Pharms., Inc. v. Bionpharma Inc., C.A. No. 18-1962-\nLPS, 2021 WL 1751148, at *14 (D. Del. Apr. 29, 2021), aff'd sub nom. Azurity Pharms., Inc. v. \nBionPharma Inc., C.A. No. 2021-1926 , 2022 WL 703903 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 9, 2022) (considering \nexpert testimony as whether amendment was narrowing and tangential when evaluating \namendment-based estoppel); Pfizer Inc. v. Teva Pharms. US.A., Inc., 882 F. Supp. 2d 643, 729 \n(D. Del. 2012), aff'd sub nom. Pfizer Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 555 F. App'x 961 (Fed. Cir. \n2014) (\"[E]vidence from the prosecution history coupled with testimony adduced at trial indicating \nthat 0.20% impurity in a compound would be viewed by organic chemists as insignificant and, \noften, undetectable, leads the court to conclude that the applicants did not surrender their \nequivalence argument and prosecution history estoppel does not apply in this case.\"), with Pioneer \nMagnetics , Inc. v. Micro Linear Corp., 330 F.3d 1352, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (declining to consider \nattorney declaration explaining reasoning for adding limitation when evaluating if amendment was \nrelated to patentability); Noven Pharms., Inc. v.

Dec. 22, 2017) (declining to rely upon in-house patent attorney \ntestimony to try to prove that reason for amendment was \"only tangential to the alleged \nequivalent\"). \n3 See, e.g., Amgen Inc. v. Alkem Lab ys Ltd., C.A. No. 17-815-GMS , 2017 WL 6493150, \nat *2 (D. Del. Dec. 19, 2017) (declining to consider amendment-based prosecution history estoppel \non Rule 12(c) motion); accord Lighthouse Consulting Grp., LLC v. BB&T Corp., 476 F. Supp. 3d \n532, 538 (W.D. Tex. 2020) (declining to bar infringement action under amendment-based \nprosecution history estoppel on Rule 12(c) motion); see also Noven Pharms., Inc. v. Amneal \nPharms. LLC, C.A.

Sept. 4, 2020) (deciding \namendment-based prosecution history estoppel and tangentiality requirement after trial); Noven \n6 Therefore, the Court declines to decide at this time whether amendment-based prosecution \nhistory estoppel applies and, if so, the extent of any such estoppel. Those questions may be \nresolved, if appropriate, at a later stage of the litigation , after the development of a full evidentiary \nrecord.4 \nIV.
