Young Correct ional Institution, W ilmington, Delaware .  Pro Se \nPlaintiff.  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nA\npril 7 , 2022 \nWilmington, Delaware1 ANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \nPlaintiff  Eric Jones, an inmate at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in \nWilmington , Delaware,  filed this action pursuant to  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 .  (D.I. 1).  Plaintiff  \nappears pro se and has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.   (D.I. 7).  The \nCourt proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 \n1915A(a).    \nBACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff alleges he was subjected to excessive force and\nassault and  battery by Defendant C/O Sweeney on April 29, 2019 and that Defendant \nHRYCI Warden Akinbayo Kolawole failed to discipline or take other action to curb the \nknown pattern of physical abuse by Sweeny.   Plaintiff was released from HRYCI seven \ndays after the i ncident and, at some point , again incarcerated  at HRYCI.  \nPlaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.   \nSCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \nA federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte  under the screening \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A(b) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, \n452 (3d Cir. 2013).  S ee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (actions in which prisoner seeks redress from a governmental defendant) .  The Court must accept all factual  allegations in a complaint as true and /s/ Richard G. Andrews2 \n take them in the light most favorable to a pro se  plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 \n(2007).  Because Plaintiff proceeds pro se , his pleading is liberally construed and his  \nComplaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than \nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94.    \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u2018 indisputably meritless legal theory \u2019 or a \u2018 clearly baseless \u2019 or \n\u2018fantastic or delusional \u2019 factual scenario.\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  To urscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. \n1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915 A, the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint unless \namendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S.10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.  See id. at 1 1.  3 \n  A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take thre e steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, \nbecause they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; and (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).  Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \n\u201ccontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff complains of an act that took place on April 29, 2019 .  He filed his \ncomplaint on July 27, 2021 as determined by the  prisoner mailbox rule.  See Houston \nv. Lack, 487 U.S. 266 (1988); Burns v. Morton , 134 F.3d 109, 112 (3d Cir. 1998);  Gibbs \nv. Decker , 234 F. Supp. 2d 458, 463 (D. Del. 2002) .    \nFor purposes of the statute of limitations, \u00a7 1983 claims are characterized as \npersonal injury actions.  Wilson v. Garcia , 471 U.S. 261, 275 (1985).  In Delaware,  \n\u00a7 1983 claims are subject to a two -year limitations period.  See  10 Del. Code \u00a7  8119; \nJohnson v. Cullen, 925 F.  Supp. 244, 248 (D. Del. 1996).  Section 1983 claims accrue \n\u201cwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which its action is \nbased. \u201d  Sameric Corp. v. City of Philadelphia , 142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir. 1998).  \nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that generally must be raised \nby the defendant, and it is waived if not properly raised.  See Benak ex rel. Alliance 4 \n Premier Growth Fund v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. L.P.,  435 F.3d 396, 400 n.14 (3d Cir. \n2006); Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon,  807 F.2d 1150, 1167 (3d Cir. 1986).  \u201c Although \nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, sua sponte dismissal is appropriate \nwhen \u2018the defense is obvi ous from the face of the complaint and no further factual \nrecord is required to be developed. \u2019\u201d  Davis v. Gauby , 408 F. App\u2019 x 524, 526 (3d Cir. \n2010)  (quoting Fogle v. Pierson , 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006)).  Hence,  a court \nmay dismiss a time -barre d complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \nPlaintiff  complains of an act that occurr ed on April 29, 2019.  Realizing that the \nComplaint was not timely filed,  Plaintiff asks the Court to excuse the late filing.  Plaintiff \nexplains that he w as released from HRYCI seven days after the incident ; that is May 5, \n2019.  Following his release, he \u201c went to many attorneys  to receive legal counsel\u201d and \nfound one who would take the case, but he did not have money at the time to pay the attorney.  He ex plains that when he had the money to pay an attorney, COVID -19 shut \ndown everything, he had  to use the money to pay a bill , and then had no money and no \nway to pay for an attorney.  He states that  upon his re -incarcerat ion the prison law \nlibrary was shut down and,  as of July 5, 2021, all things were open.   He filed his \ncomplaint about three weeks later.  \nPlaintiff provides no basis for the Court to toll the two- year limitation period. \nUnder federal law, equitable tolling is appropriate in three general  scenarios:  (1) where \na defendant actively misleads a plaintiff with respect to his cause of action; (2) where the plaintiff has been prevented from asserting his claim as a result of other extraordinary circumstances; or (3) where the plaintiff asserts his claims in a timely 5 \n manner but has done so in the wrong forum.  Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 370 n.9 (3d \nCir. 2000).   \nPlaintiff seems to assert  that he was prevented from timely filing his complaint  as \na result of extraordinary circumstances.  It is ap parent that Plaintiff was aware of the \nincident when it occurred on April 29, 2019 given that he sought an attorney to \nrepresent him upon his release from prison.  The fact that Plaintiff did not have the \nfunds to pay for an attorney does not excuse the late filing  and is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance .  Plaintiff could  have  timely filed a pro se complaint just as he eventually \ndid, albeit too late.  Plaintiff provides no basis to toll the limitation period.   \nPlaintiff did not  file his Complaint until July 27, 2021 , some three months after the \nexpiration of the limitation period.   It is evident from the face of the Complaint that  \nPlaintiff\u2019s claims  a re barred by the two year limitation period.   Therefore, the Complaint \nwill be  dismiss ed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) .  \nAmendment is futile.  \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will  dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1).   The Court finds amendment futile.  \n An ap propriate O rder will be entered.  "}
