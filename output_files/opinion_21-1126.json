(\u201cTwinstrand\u201d) and University of Washington\n(\u201cUW;;\u201d together, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d): (1) a partial motion to dismiss Counterclaims V to VIII for failure\nto state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and strike related affirmative\ndefenses under Rule 12(f), (D.I. 38);! and (2) a motion to sever and stay Counterclaims I to IV,\n(D.I. 75)? Briefing on the motions is complete, and the court held oral argument on October 27,\n2022. For the following reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART the motion to\n\ndismiss and strike, and DENY without prejudice the motion to sever and stay.\n\n! The briefing associated with the pending motion to dismiss is found at D.I. 39, D.I. 43, and DI.\n48.\n\n2 The briefing and related filings associated with the pending motion to sever and stay are found\nat D.I. 76, D.I. 82, D.I. 83, and D.I. 86.\nIL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Plaintiffs\u2019 Infringement Claims\n\nPlaintiffs filed this action on August 3, 2021, asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos.\n10,287, 631 (\u201cthe \u2019631 patent\u201d); 10,689,699 (\u201cthe \u2019699 patent\u201d); 10,752,951 (\u201cthe \u2019951 patent\u201d);\nand 10,760,127 (\u201cthe \u2019127 patent;\u201d collectively, the \u201cAsserted Patents\u201d). (D.I. 1) The Asserted\nPatents claim duplex sequencing methods that allow reliable, early, non-invasive cancer\ndetection and post-treatment cancer monitoring in patients by analyzing blood plasma. (/d. at J]\n13, 22) Jesse Salk, M.D., Ph.D, and his co-inventors conceived of these inventions through their\nwork at UW and subsequently founded TwinStrand, which exclusively licenses the Asserted\nPatents from UW to make the technology available to clinicians and researchers under the\nTwinStrand Duplex Sequencing\u2122 technology platform. (Jd. at {] 13-14, 25-26; D.I. 30 at {]\n122-23) The Asserted Patents issued between May 2019 and September 2020. (D.L. 1 at [J 9-\n12)\n\nThe complaint alleges that defendant Guardant Health, Inc. (\u201cGuardant\u201d) sells sequencing\nmethod products and services that infringe the Asserted Patents, including the Guardant360 lab\ndeveloped test, Guardant360 CDx, GuardantOMNI, Guardant Reveal, Guardant LUNAR-2,\nGuardant360 Response, and Guardant360 TissueNext (collectively, the \u201cGuardant Kits\u201d or\n\u201cAccused Products\u201d). (D.I. 1 at {[ 27-28) Guardant\u2019s customers use the Guardant Kits to collect\ntissue samples and return them to Guardant for sequencing using an allegedly infringing digital\nsequencing method. (/d. at J 28)\n\nB. Guardant\u2019s Counterclaims\n\nGuardant filed an answer to the complaint on October 1, 2021, (D.I. 10), and filed an\n\namended answer and counterclaims on January 12, 2022, (D.I. 30). Counterclaims I to IV allege\nthat TwinStrand\u2019s Duplex Sequencing\u2122 kits and methods infringe Guardant\u2019s U.S. Patent Nos.\n10,801,063 (\u201cthe \u2019063 patent\u201d), 10,889,858 (\u201cthe \u2019858 patent\u201d), 11,118,221 (\u201cthe \u2019221 patent\u201d),\nand 11,149,306 (\u201cthe *306 patent; collectively, the \u201cCounterclaim Patents\u201d). (D.I. 30 at <\u00a5 134-\n39, 149-225) The Counterclaim Patents are directed to methods and systems for detecting\ngenetic variants using liquid biopsy cancer assays, which are less painful, less expensive,\nquicker, and more comprehensive than traditional tumor-based genotyping assays. (Id. at {]\n116-20, 130-33) The 063, \u00b0221, and \u00b0306 patents name Helmy Eltoukhy, AmirAli Talasaz, and\nStefanie Ann Ward Mortimer as inventors, and the \u2019858 patent names Mr. Talasaz and Ms.\nMortimer as inventors. (D.I. 30, Exs. A-D) The Counterclaim Patents issued between October\n2020 and October 2021. (Jd. at ff 130-33) Guardant was assigned all rights, title, and interest to\nthe Counterclaim Patents. (/d., Exs. A-D)\n\nCounterclaims V and VI seek declarations of unpatentability of Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00b0699 and \u00b0951\npatents under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 115, and/or 135(b). (D.I. 30 at J] 226-43) According to\nGuardant, TwinStrand copied certain claims of the \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents from Guardant\u2019s U.S.\nPatent No. 9,834,822 (\u201cthe \u2019822 patent\u201d) and Application No. WO2015/100427 (\u201cthe \u00b0427\napplication\u201d), respectively. (/d. at J] 141, 145) Asa result, Guardant alleges that Plaintiffs\u2019\n699 and \u2019951 patents do not name the actual inventors of the claimed subject matter. (Jd. at\n228, 238)\n\nCounterclaim VII alleges that the \u2019699 patent is unenforceable due to TwinStrand\u2019s\ninequitable conduct during prosecution of the application leading to the patent\u2019s issuance. (/d. at\n41 143, 147, 245-47, 271-73) On May 13, 2019, TwinStrand filed Application No. 16/411,066\n(\u201cthe \u2019066 application\u201d), which later issued as the \u2019699 patent. (/d. at ] 248) The \u2019066\n\napplication names Jesse Salk, Lawrence Loeb, and Michael Schmitt as inventors and claims\npriority to Provisional Application No. 61/613,413, which was filed on March 20, 2012. (Jd.)\nThe counterclaims allege that claims 37-39 and 41-43 of the \u2019066 application were exact copies\nof claims 1-3, 6-7, and 10 of Guardant\u2019s \u2019822 patent, which issued on December 5, 2017. (Ud. at\n250) The named inventors of the \u2019066 application cited Guardant\u2019s \u2019822 patent in the\nInformation Disclosure Statement (\u201cIDS\u201d) they filed on June 18, 2019. (Ud. at \u00a7 252) However,\nthey did not notify the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) that certain claims\nof the \u00b0066 application were copied from the \u2019822 patent. (/d. at 257)\n\nSimilarly, Counterclaim VIII alleges that the \u00b0951 patent is unenforceable due to\nTwinStrand\u2019s inequitable conduct during prosecution of Application No. 16/514,931 (\u201cthe \u2019931\napplication\u201d), which was filed on July 17, 2019, and led to the issuance of the \u00b0951 patent. (D.L.\n30 at 274) The \u2019931 application also names Jesse Salk, Lawrence Loeb, and Michael Schmitt\nas inventors and claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61/613,413, which was filed on\nMarch 20, 2012. (/d.) The counterclaims allege that claims 1 to 2 of the 931 application are\nnear copies of claims 77 to 78 of Guardant\u2019s \u2019427 application, which was published on July 7,\n2015. Ud. at ]275) The named inventors of the \u2019931 application cited Guardant\u2019s \u2019427\napplication in a different application, WO2017/100441, confirming their awareness of the\nreference two years before they filed the \u2019931 application. (/d. at 277) Nonetheless,\nCounterclaim VIII alleges they did not notify the USPTO that claims 1 to 2 of the 931\napplication were effectively copied from the \u00b0427 application. (/d. at \u00a7 282)\n\nC. The Illumina Action\n\nTwo months after Guardant filed its answer and counterclaims, Illumina, Inc.\n(\u201cIllumina\u201d) sued Guardant, Eltoukhy, and Talasaz in this court for correction of inventorship,\n\ntrade secret misappropriation, and breach of contract (the \u201cIllumina Action\u201d). [lumina, Inc. v.\nGuardant Health, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 22-334-GBW-CJB, D.I. 1 (D. Del. Mar. 17, 2022). The\ncomplaint states that Eltoukhy and Talasaz co-founded Guardant while they were still employed\nby Illumina. (D.I. 76, Ex. 1 at 2-3, 20-26) Eltoukhy and Talasaz allegedly misappropriated\nIilumina\u2019s confidential information and trade secrets to develop Guardant\u2019s technology and\nprepare the patent applications that subsequently issued as a number of patents, including the\nCounterclaim Patents. (Jd. at {J 50, 54, 57, 62, 66, 91) Illumina seeks a declaratory judgment to\nname Ilumina as at least a co-owner of the Counterclaim Patents based on Eltoukhy\u2019s alleged\nassignments to Illumina. (/d. at { 100)\n\nA motion to dismiss Ilumina\u2019s complaint, which was filed on May 25, 2022, remains\npending. (C.A. No. 22-334-GBW-CJB, D.I. 29) A motion to transfer filed on the same date was\nsubsequently withdrawn. (/d., D.I. 26; D.I. 69) On August 17, 2022, the court entered a\nscheduling order in the Illumina Action setting a fact discovery deadline of October 13, 2023, an\nexpert discovery deadline of March 28, 2024, a dispositive motion deadline of April 10, 2024,\nand a trial date in September 2024. (/d., D.I. 55)\n\nD. The IPR Proceedings\n\nPlaintiffs and Guardant have each filed five petitions for inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d)\nbefore the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u2122\u201d) challenging the Counterclaim Patents and\nthe Asserted Patents, respectively. (D.I. 83 at \u00a7{ 9-10) Institution decisions on Plaintiffs\u2019 IPRs\nare expected between October 2022 and January 2023, and institution decisions on Guardant\u2019s\nIPR petitions are anticipated between August and December 2022. (/d.)\n\nE. The Foundation Medicine Actions\n\nOn November 9, 2017, Guardant sued its competitor, Foundation Medicine, Inc. (\u201cFMI\u201d),\n\nfor infringement of four of Guardant\u2019s patents (the \u201cFMI I Action\u201d). (C.A. No. 17-1616-LPS-\nCJB, D.I. 1) In response, FMI asserted counterclaims against Guardant for inequitable conduct\nby Eltoukhy and Talasaz, who allegedly made material misrepresentations to the USPTO\nregarding the inventorship of certain Guardant patents by omitting Eltoukhy as an inventor\nbecause he was still subject to an assignment agreement with Illumina. (/d., D.I. 168 at \u00a7\u00a5 57-75,\n82-84, 91-93, 100-02, 109-11) Shortly before the case was to proceed to trial in November of\n2020, a spoliation issue arose based on allegations that Eltoukhy deleted certain data. (/d., D.I.\n505) As a result of the spoliation issue, the court continued the trial indefinitely, and the parties\nsubsequently reached a settlement agreement. (/d., D.I. 513; D.I. 583)\n\nThree years later, shortly after the spoliation allegations came to light in the FMI I\nAction, Guardant brought another suit against FMI for infringement of another set of related\nGuardant patents (the \u201cFMI II Action\u201d), including the 063 patent at issue in Guardant\u2019s\ncounterclaims in the present action. (C.A. No. 20-1580-LPS, D.J. 1) FMI again brought\ninequitable conduct counterclaims for each of the patents-in-suit, alleging that Eltoukhy and\nTalasaz made material misrepresentations regarding the inventorship of the patents to the\nUSPTO during prosecution. (/d., D.I. 22 at Ff] 146-48, 155-57, 164-66, 173-75, 182-84, 191-93,\n200-02)\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims V to VIII\n\nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and view\nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780,\n\n790-91 (3d Cir. 2016). \u201cCourts use the same standard in ruling on a motion to dismiss a\ncounterclaim under Rule 12(b)(6) as they do in assessing a claim in a complaint.\u201d Goddard Sys.,\nInc. v. Gondal, C.A. No. 17-1003-CJB, 2018 WL 1513018, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 27, 2018).\n\nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint\nmust contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the\ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations\nallow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.\n\nThe court\u2019s determination is not whether the non-moving party \u201cwill ultimately prevail,\u201d\nbut whether that party is \u201centitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\u201d In re Burlington Coat\nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). This \u201cdoes not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,\u201d but instead\n\u201csimply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal\nevidence of [the necessary element].\u201d Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir.\n2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The court\u2019s analysis is a context-specific task\nrequiring the court \u201cto draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Jgbal, 556 U.S. at\n663-64.\n\n1. Inequitable conduct\n\nAn individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application engages\n\nin inequitable conduct when he or she makes an affirmative misrepresentation of a material fact,\n\nfails to disclose material information, or submits false material information to the USPTO, with a\nspecific intent to deceive the USPTO. See Star Sci., Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 537 F.3d\n1357, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Allegations for each of these requirements must be pled with\nparticularity pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). See Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc., 575 F.3d 1312, 1328-29 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\n[T]o plead the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of inequitable conduct with the requisite\n\n\u201cparticularity\u201d under Rule 9(b), the pleading must identify the specific who, what,\n\nwhen, where, and how of the material misrepresentation or omission committed\n\nbefore the PTO. Moreover, although \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cintent\u201d may be averred\n\ngenerally, a pleading of inequitable conduct under Rule 9(b) must include\n\nsufficient allegations of underlying facts from which a court may reasonably infer\n\nthat a specific individual (1) knew of the withheld material information or of the\n\nfalsity of the material misrepresentation, and (2) withheld or misrepresented this\n\ninformation with a specific intent to deceive the PTO.\nId. Although a party may plead facts upon \u201cinformation and belief,\u201d it must also set forth the\n\u201cspecific facts upon which the belief is reasonably based.\u201d Jd. at 1330.\n\na. Omissions\n\nThe parties do not meaningfully dispute that Guardant\u2019s inequitable conduct\ncounterclaims identify omissions with sufficient particularity. Specifically, Counts VII and VIII\nallege that named inventors Jesse Salk, Lawrence Loeb, Michael Schmitt, and patent attorney\nLara J. Dueppen did not notify the USPTO that claims 37 to 39 and 41 to 43 of the 066\napplication were copied from Guardant\u2019s \u2019822 patent (D.I. 30 at 257), and claims 1-2 of the\n\u00b0931 application were copied from Guardant\u2019s \u2019427 application (id. at | 282). These facts are\npled with sufficient particularity to identify the alleged omissions.\n\nb. Materiality\nGuardant\u2019s inequitable conduct counterclaims fail to satisfy the materiality requirement\n\nunder either a per se or but-for standard. Counterclaims VII and VIII assert a per se materiality\n\nstandard, alleging that the failure to notify the USPTO of copied patent claims amounts to\naffirmative egregious misconduct. (D.I. 30 at ff 260-61, 285-86) In support of this contention,\nthe counterclaims recite provisions pertaining to the inventors\u2019 duty to disclose under the Code\nof Federal Regulations and the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (\u201cMPEP\u201d). (/d. at J]\n254-59; 279-84) For instance, MPEP \u00a7 2001.06(d) requires an applicant to identify claims that\nare copied are substantially copied from a patent because the source of the copied claims is\nmaterial information under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56. MPEP \u00a7 2001.06(d). Section 1.56 requires\nindividuals associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application to disclose to the\nUSPTO \u201call information known to that individual to be material to patentability[.]\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7\n1.56(a).\n\nThese allegations are insufficient to establish the per se materiality of the alleged\nomissions for purposes of the inequitable conduct standard. The Federal Circuit has expressly\ndeclined to adopt the definition of materiality set forth in 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56 in analyzing claims\nfor inequitable conduct. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1293-94 (rejecting definition of materiality\nin 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56 for purposes of inequitable conduct because it sets a low bar for materiality\nand \u201cwould inevitably result in . . . patent litigators continuing to charge inequitable conduct in\nnearly every case as a litigation strategy.\u201d). Accordingly, a violation of the duty to disclose\nclaim copying under MPEP \u00a7 2001.06(d) cannot form the basis for materiality on a cause of\naction for inequitable conduct. See Flypsi, Inc. v. Dialpad, Inc., 2022 WL 3593132, at *5 (W.D.\nTex. Aug. 22, 2022) (rejecting application of materiality test under MPEP \u00a7 2001.06(c) to the\nmateriality inquiry on a claim for inequitable conduct).\n\nMoreover, well-pleaded allegations of per se materiality must be based on affirmative\nacts of egregious misconduct, such as the submission of a false affidavit or declaration to the\n\nUSPTO. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1292 (explaining that the per se materiality standard is an\nexception applied only in cases of affirmative egregious misconduct); Outside the Box\nInnovations, LLC v. Travel Caddy, Inc., 695 F.3d 1285, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Here, the parties\ndo not dispute that the foundation of Guardant\u2019s inequitable conduct counterclaims is the alleged\nomission of claim copying information. Guardant cites no authority to suggest that per se\nmateriality can be based on alleged omissions, as opposed to affirmative acts, in support of a\nclaim for inequitable conduct. To the extent that Counterclaims VII and VIII are based on\nallegations of per se materiality, those claims cannot survive Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss.\n\nGuardant\u2019s inequitable conduct counterclaims likewise fail to satisfy the but-for\nmateriality standard. To assess the materiality of a withheld reference under the but-for standard,\n\u201cthe court must determine whether the PTO would have allowed the claim if it had been aware of\nthe undisclosed reference.\u201d Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291. Plaintiffs argue that Counterclaims\nVII and VIII lack factual allegations leading to a plausible inference that an interference would\nhave been triggered or the USPTO would have rejected the claims if they had notified the\nexaminer of the claim copying. (D.1. 39 at 13-14) A review of the counterclaims supports\nPlaintiffs\u2019 position.\n\nIn the pleading, Guardant identifies the claims of the \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents that were\nallegedly copied from Guardant\u2019s \u2019822 patent and \u2019427 application, respectively, and states that\nthe \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents would not have issued if Plaintiffs disclosed this alleged claim copying\nto the USPTO. (D.I. 30 at ff] 257, 263, 282, 288) In support of this contention, Guardant\nexplains that the named inventors and patent attorney Lara Dueppen disclosed claim copying in\nanother instance, and no patent issued from U.S. Application No. 16/118,305 after the claim\ncopying was disclosed. (Jd. at J] 266-68, 291-93) The court takes judicial notice that this\n\nfactual allegation was subsequently rendered false. See Secured Mail Sols. LLC v. Universal\nWilde, Inc., 873 F.3d 905, 913 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\u201c[A] court need not accept as true allegations\nthat contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit, such as the claims and the\npatent specification.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). On February 8, 2022,\nabout a month after Guardant filed its inequitable conduct counterclaims, the claims of U.S.\nApplication No. 16/118,305 issued without amendment as U.S. Patent No. 11,242,562. (D.I. 39,\nEx. CC)\n\nCounterclaims VII and VIII also state that identifying the copied claims of the \u2019699 and\n\u00b0951 patents would have triggered an interference, leading to \u201ca much more thorough and in-\ndepth examination as to whether the claims\u201d should be issued. (D.I. 30 at [J 262, 287) Plaintiffs\nchallenge the likelihood that an interference would have been declared because the copied claims\nwere later amended, and the \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents claim priority to a pre-AIA provisional\napplication. (D.I. 39 at 14; D.I. 48 at 4-5) But the court need not delve into the significance of\npriority issues and claim amendments to determine that the interference allegations are\ninsufficient to establish the materiality of the alleged claim copying. Counterclaims VII and VIII\ndo not allege that Plaintiffs were likely to lose a potential interference, or that the claims of the\n*699 and \u2019951 patents would not have issued as a result of an interference. On this record,\nGuardant has failed to plead that a potential interference would have adversely impacted the\npatentability of the \u00b0699 and \u2019951 patent claims.\n\nAt oral argument on October 27, 2022, Guardant argued that Plaintiffs\u2019 undisclosed claim\ncopying was but-for material because it occurred more than one year after the \u00b0822 patent had\nissued, thus, falling outside of the timeframe for triggering an interference proceeding.\n(10/27/2022 Tr.) Counterclaim VII alleges that Plaintiffs \u201cdeliberately and improperly copied\n\nclaims from the \u2019822 Patent more than one year after issuance of the \u2019822 Patent in violation of\n\n11\n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b),\u201d and \u201c[b]y doing so outside of the one-year timeframe, [Plaintiffs] attempted\nto evade an interference proceeding.\u201d (D.I. 30 at [{ 246, 272) But the pleading does not allege\nthat the \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents would not have issued if the untimely claim copying had been\ndisclosed or otherwise explain how the alleged violation of \u00a7 135(b) would have adversely\nimpacted the issuance of the \u2019699 and \u00b0951 patent claims.\n\nGuardant\u2019s reliance on Diebold Nixdorf, Inc. v. Hyosung Tns, Inc. does not change the\ncourt\u2019s analysis. C.A. No. 19-1695-LPS, 2021 WL 861734, at *4 (D. Del. Mar. 4, 2021). In\nDiebold, the court found that the defendant adequately pleaded the but-for materiality of a prior\nart reference where \u201c[t]he pleadings contain[ed] specific allegations\u201d that the prior art reference\n\u201cdescribes numerous reasons and motivations that would lead a person having ordinary skill in\nthe art to the alleged inventions of the [asserted patent] with predictable results and expected\nsuccess.\u201d Jd. Unlike in Diebold, the inequitable conduct allegations here are not based on an\nalleged failure to disclose a prior art reference. Guardant fails to explain how the alleged fact of\nundisclosed copying is analogous to an undisclosed prior art reference in a but-for materiality\nanalysis. Unlike in Diebold, Guardant\u2019s factual allegations in Counterclaims VII and VIII stop at\nthe likelihood that an interference proceeding would have been triggered, without suggesting that\nthe ultimate outcome of any interference proceeding would negatively affect the issuance of the\n699 and \u2019951 patents. Absent allegations regarding the outcome of the interference proceeding,\nGuardant cannot show that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim copying would have adversely impacted the issuance\nof any claims in the 699 and \u00b0951 patents.\n\nBecause Guardant\u2019s inequitable conduct counterclaims do not adequately establish the\nmateriality of the alleged omissions, I recommend that the court grant Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to\n\ndismiss Counterclaims VII and VIII.\n\n12\nc. Specific intent\n\nPlaintiffs also challenge the sufficiency of Guardant\u2019s deceptive intent allegations in\nCounterclaims VII and VIII. (D.I. 39 at 10-12) At the pleading stage, Guardant \u201cneed only\nallege facts from which the Court could reasonably infer that the patent applicant made a\ndeliberate decision to deceive the PTO.\u201d Natera, Inc. v. Genosity Inc., C.A. No. 20-1352-LPS,\n2022 WL 767602, at *5 (D. Del. Mar. 14, 2022) (quoting Wyeth Holdings Corp. v. Sandoz, Inc.,\nC.A. No. 09-955-LPS-CJB, 2012 WL 600715, at *7 (D. Del. Feb. 3, 2012)). But the facts\nalleged in Guardant\u2019s counterclaims cannot sustain a reasonable inference that the named\ninventors and prosecution counsel made a deliberate decision to deceive the USPTO during the\nprosecution of the \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents by concealing their claim copying activities. See\nExergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 575 F.3d 1312, 1330-31 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (explaining\nthat specific intent allegations must identify a specific individual who owed a duty of disclosure,\nknew of the specific material information, and made a deliberate decision to withhold it).\n\nGuardant\u2019s inequitable conduct counterclaims allege that the named inventors and\nprosecution counsel engaged in a \u201cpractice of copying claims into their own applications without\ndisclosing that the claims are copied,\u201d citing five instances of alleged claim copying.\u2019 (D.I. 30 at\n{1 265, 290) This asserted pattern of conduct forms the basis for Guardant\u2019s position that the\n\ninventors engaged in a purposeful effort to copy claims without disclosing to the USPTO that\n\n3 Guardant also contends that the inventors\u2019 disclosure of claim copying in connection with the\n\u00b0305 application shows they \u201cengaged in a systemic practice of copying claims\u201d and had an\nincentive to withhold the information in subsequent prosecutions once the \u2019305 application did\nnot issue as a patent. (D.I. 43 at 7) As explained at \u00a7 II.A.1.b, supra, the \u2019305 application\nultimately issued as U.S. Patent No. 11, 242,562. (D.I. 39, Ex. CC) Because Plaintiffs suffered\nno adverse consequences from their disclosure of claim copying during prosecution of the \u2019305\napplication, there is no reason to infer that the claim copying disclosure in that prosecution\ndissuaded the inventors from disclosing claim copying in connection with prosecution of the\n699 and 951 patents.\n\n13\nthose claims were copied. (D.I. 43 at 6-7) However, Guardant\u2019s own pleaded allegations\nundercut the inference it seeks to draw. In four of the five claim copying examples cited by\nGuardant, the pleading confirms that the allegedly copied references were disclosed to the\nexaminer in an information disclosure statement (\u201cIDS\u201d). (D.L. 30 at ff 265, 290) Plaintiffs\u2019\npattern of disclosing the allegedly copied references in the IDS forecloses a reasonable inference\nthat Plaintiffs sought to conceal the copying of those references. See Allergan USA, Inc. v.\nProllenium US Inc., C.A. No. 19-126-CFC-SRF, 2019 WL 7298569, at *8 (D. Del. Dec. 30,\n2019) (concluding that the disclosure of a prior art reference in an IDS indicated a lack of\nspecific intent to deceive the USPTO).\n\nGuardant\u2019s allegations of the inventors\u2019 specific intent to conceal claim copying in the\n\u00b0699 patent are also implausible. Counterclaim VII states that Plaintiffs submitted exact copies\nof claims 1-3, 6-7, and 10 from Guardant\u2019s 822 patent in claims 37-39 and 41-43 of the \u2019066\napplication, which led to the issuance of the 699 patent. (D.I. 30 at \u00a2 250) In the briefing,\nGuardant concedes that the 699 patent claims are not exact copies of the \u2019822 patent claims and\noffers to amend the pleaded allegation to correct the inaccuracy. (D.I. 43 at 8n.1) Nonetheless,\nGuardant maintains that the claims are near-exact copies with immaterial differences, creating a\nstrong inference that the claims were copied. (Jd. at 8-10)\n\nAccepting as true the substantial similarity of the copied claims in the \u2019699 patent,\nGuardant\u2019s pleaded allegations still do not give rise to a reasonable inference that Plaintiffs\nintended to deceive the USPTO. Counterclaim VII expressly states that the \u00b0822 patent was\ndisclosed in an IDS during prosecution of the \u2019699 patent. (D.I. 30 at 252) The disclosure of\nthe 822 patent in the IDS \u201cpoints away from an intent to deceive,\u201d despite the fact that Plaintiffs\n\ndid not specifically identify the allegedly copied claims for the examiner. Pixion, Inc. v. Citrix\n\n14\nSys., Inc., 2012 WL 762005, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2012) (quoting Akron Polymer Container\nCorp. v. Exxel Container, Inc., 148 F.3d 1380, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).\n\nGuardant\u2019s claim copying allegations in Counterclaim VIII also fail to give rise to a\nreasonable inference that the named inventors and prosecuting attorney specifically intended to\nconceal their claim copying during prosecution of the \u00b0951 patent. There is no averment that the\nprosecuting attorney had knowledge of the \u2019427 application. The pleading alleges that the\ninventors were aware of Guardant\u2019s \u2019427 application because they cited it in their own patent\napplication filed two years before they submitted the application leading to the 951 patent. (D.I.\n30 at ]277) But \u201c[{a] reference may be many pages long, and its various teachings may be\nrelevant to different applications for different reasons. Thus, one cannot assume that an\nindividual, who generally knew that a reference existed, also knew of the specific material\ninformation contained in that reference.\u201d Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1330.\n\nSuch is the case here. Counterclaim VIII states that the inventors did not notify the\nUSPTO that claims 1 and 2 of the 951 patent were copied from the \u00b0427 application, but it fails\nto suggest that the inventors were specifically aware of claims 77 and 78 from the \u2019427\napplication or that they knew those claims were substantially similar to claims 1 and 2 of the\n\u00b0951 patent. (D.I. 30 at \u00a7{ 275, 282) As a result, these allegations lack sufficient underlying\nfacts to support a reasonable inference that the inventors of the \u2019951 patent withheld claim\ncopying information with a specific intent to deceive the USPTO. See Exergen, 575 F.3d at\n1330 (explaining that, although knowledge and intent may be averred generally, an inequitable\n\nconduct claim must still set forth specific facts on which the averments are based).\n\n15\nBecause Guardant has failed to adequately plead the materiality and intent prongs of their\ncounterclaims for inequitable conduct, I recommend that the court dismiss Counterclaims VII\nand VIII of Guardant\u2019s pleading without prejudice.\n\n2. Inventorship\n\nPlaintiffs also seek dismissal of Guardant\u2019s Counterclaims V and VI, which aver that the\n\u00b0699 and \u2019951 patents are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 115, and 135(b) for failure to\nname the actual inventors of the claimed subject matter. (D.I. 39 at 15-18) For the following\nreasons, I recommend that the court grant-in-part Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss Counterclaims V\nand VI. Specifically, I recommend that the court deny the motion to the extent that it seeks\ndismissal of Counterclaims V and VI under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 115, and grant the motion to\nthe extent that it seeks dismissal of Counterclaim V under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b).\n\na. Unpatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 115\n\nThe Federal Circuit has explained that \u201c[a] patent is invalid if more or less than the true\ninventors are named,\u201d Trovan, Ltd. v. Sokymat SA, Irori, 299 F.3d 1292, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002),\nand \u201c[c]onception is the touchstone of inventorship,\u201d CODA Dev. S.R.O. v. Goodyear Tire &\nRubber Co., 916 F.3d 1350, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting Acromed Corp. v. Sofamor Danek\nGrp., Inc., 253 F.3d 1371, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). The sufficiency of a cause of action for patent\ninvalidity pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 115 at the pleading stage is governed by Rule 8, as\nopposed to the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). See Belcher Pharms., LLC v.\nHospira, Inc., C.A. No. 17-775-LPS, 2019 WL 2503159, at *1 (D. Del. June 5, 2019). Here, the\nparties dispute whether Counterclaims V and VI should be dismissed for failure to allege facts\n\nregarding the conception of the 699 and 951 patents. (D.I. 39 at 16-17; D.I. 43 at 12-13)\n\n16\nCounterclaims V and VI plausibly allege improper inventorship of the \u2019699 and 951\npatents. See Belcher Pharms., LLC v. Hospira, Inc., C.A. No. 17-775-LPS, 2019 WL 2503159,\nat *1 n.1 (D. Del. June 5, 2019) (explaining that a patent may be invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\nand 115 if it names the wrong inventors). The pleading avers that the inventions of the 699 and\n\u2019951 patents were not made by the named inventors; instead, those claims were copied from\nGuardant\u2019s \u2019822 patent and \u2019427 application, respectively. (D.I. 30 at J] 141-42, 145-46, 233-\n34, 242) Guardant accuses TwinStrand of \u201cshamelessly attack[ing] Guardant\u2019s patent portfolio\nby copying Guardant\u2019s own patent claims into TwinStrand patent applications\u2014misrepresenting\nTwinStrand employees and founders as the true inventors of the claimed inventions[.]\u201d (/d. at J\n124) While Plaintiffs accurately report that the pleading does not expressly refer to the\n\u201cconception\u201d of the \u2019699 and \u2019951 patents, the pleaded allegations give rise to a plausible\ninference that the named inventors of those patents did not conceive of the claimed inventions,\nwhich were instead copied from other references. (Id. at {J 124, 141, 145, 233-34, 242)\nCounterclaims V and VI also give rise to a plausible inference that the named inventors of\nGuardant\u2019s \u2019822 patent and \u2019427 application conceived of the claimed inventions in the \u00b0699 and\n*951 patents because those references are identified as the source of the copied claims. (/d. at {J\n141-42, 145-46, 234, 242) Therefore, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to\ndismiss Counterclaims V and VI for unpatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 115.\n\nBecause portions of Counterclaims V and VI remain viable, I further recommend that the\ncourt deny Plaintiffs\u2019 request to dismiss UW as a counterclaim defendant. (D.I. 39 at 18)\n\nb. Unpatentability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b)\nFor purposes of the pending motion, the parties agree that the pre-America Invents Act\n\n(\u201cAIA\u201d) version of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b) applies to the analysis of whether the 699 patent is\n\n17\nunpatentable as alleged in Counterclaim V. (D.I. 39 at 17-18; D.I. 43 at 14) Pre-AIA \u00a7 135(b)\nprovides that \u201c[a] claim which is the same as, or for the same or substantially the same subject\nmatter as, a claim of an issued patent may not be made in any application unless such a claim is\nmade prior to one year from the date on which the patent was granted.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b). The\nparties dispute whether \u00a7 135(b) provides a cause of action for invalidity. (D.I. 39 at 18; D.I. 43\nat 15-16)\n\nPlaintiffs correctly argue that \u00a7 135(b) does not provide a cause of action for invalidity.\n(D.L. 39 at 18) The Federal Circuit has explained that \u201c[bJoth the plain language of that\nprovision and the relevant legislative history make clear that [\u00a7 135] was intended to be a statute\nof repose, limiting the time during which an interference may be declared \u2018so that the patentee\nmight be more secure in his property right.\u2019\u201d Berman v. Housey, 291 F.3d 1345, 1351 (Fed. Cir.\n2002) (quoting Corbett v. Chisholm, 568 F.2d 759, 765 (C.C.P.A. 1977)); see also Regents of\nUniv. of Cal. v. Univ. of Iowa Research Found., 455 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\u201c[I]n\norder to serve as a statute of repose, section 135(b)(1) operates in conjunction with the PTO\u2019s\nduty to declare interferences.\u201d). Consequently, \u201ca determination that the claims involved in an\ninterference are not barred by \u00a7 135(b) is a condition precedent . . . that should be resolved\nbefore issues of priority and patentability are addressed.\u201d Jd. at 1352; see Chiron Corp. v.\nGenentech, Inc., 268 F. Supp. 2d 1148, 1171 (E.D. Cal. 2002) (rejecting a claim that a patent was\ninvalid under \u00a7 135(b) because the statute \u201cis a procedural bar to interference proceedings, not a\nsubstantive basis upon which to declare the claims of a patent invalid.\u201d).\n\nGuardant cites the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in Quantum Corp. v. Rodime, PLC, 65 F.3d\n1577, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1995), for the proposition that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 should be read broadly to\n\ninclude invalidity defenses not expressly identified in the statute. According to Guardant, the\n\n18\nFederal Circuit\u2019s determination in Quantum that \u00a7 282 encompasses violations of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\n305 should be further extended to include violations of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 in this case. (D.I. 43 at\n15-16) Guardant\u2019s reasoning is inapplicable here because the cases are clear that \u00a7 135(b) is\nconcerned with time limitations for declaring an interference and not a substantive basis for\ninvalidity. See Berman, 291 F.3d at 1351; Regents of Univ. of Cal., 455 F.3d at 1376; Chiron\nCorp., 268 F. Supp. 2d at 1171. Therefore, I recommend that the court dismiss Counterclaim V\nfor unpatentability of the \u00b0699 patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b).\n\nB. Motion to Strike Guardant\u2019s Fourth, Eighth, and Twelfth Affirmative Defenses\n\nPlaintiffs also ask the court to strike Guardant\u2019s Fourth, Eighth, and Twelfth Affirmative\nDefenses. Rule 12(f) permits a court to \u201cstrike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any\nredundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). Motions under\nRule 12(f) are generally disfavored. Fesnak & Assocs., LLP v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 722 F.\nSupp. 2d 496, 502 (D. Del. 2010). On a motion to strike, the court should construe all facts in\nfavor of the nonmoving party and \u201cshould not grant a motion to strike a defense unless the\ninsufficiency of the defense is clearly apparent.\u201d Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Aruba Networks, Inc.,\n609 F. Supp. 2d 353, 356 (D. Del. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nHowever, \u201ca court is not required to accept affirmative defenses that are mere bare bones\nconclusory allegations, and may strike such inadequately pleaded defenses.\u201d Sun Microsystems,\nInc. v. Versata Enters., Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d 395, 408 (D. Del. 2009). Rule 12(f) \u201chas been used\nin this jurisdiction to strike affirmative defenses where a party has failed to state a corresponding\nclaim upon which relief can be granted\u201d under Rule 12(b)(6). Wyeth Holdings, 2012 WL\n600715, at *4 (citing Power Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int'l Inc., C.A. No.\n\n08-309-JJF-LPS, 2009 WL 4928024, at *8-10 (D. Del. Dec. 18, 2009)).\n\n19\n1. Fourth and Twelfth Affirmative Defenses\n\nGuardant\u2019s Fourth and Twelfth Affirmative Defenses are coextensive with Counterclaims\nV and VI. For the reasons previously stated at \u00a7 II.A.2.a, supra, I recommend that the court deny\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike Guardant\u2019s Fourth Affirmative Defense for failure to name the correct\ninventors and derivation. For the reasons previously stated at \u00a7 IJ.A.2.b, supra, I recommend\nthat the court grant Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike Guardant\u2019s Twelfth Affirmative Defense for\nfailure to comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135.\n\n2. Eighth Affirmative Defense\n\nIn a footnote, Plaintiffs state that Guardant\u2019s Eighth Affirmative Defense for unclean\nhands \u201cappears to cover (if not be co-extensive with) Guardant\u2019s inequitable-conduct\ncounterclaims[.]\u201d (D.I. 39 at 1 n.1) \u201c[A]rguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but\nnot squarely argued, are considered waived.\u201d John Wyeth & Brother Ltd. v. Cigna Int'l Corp.,\n119 F.3d 1070, 1076, n.6 (3d Cir. 1997). The defense of unclean hands is governed by a\ndifferent standard than inequitable conduct. See Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co.,\n649 F.3d 1276, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are directed to inequitable conduct.\nTherefore, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike Guardant\u2019s Eighth\nAffirmative Defense for unclean hands. See Samsung Elecs. Co. v. Netlist, Inc.,C.A. No. 21-\n1453-RGA, 2022 WL 3027312, at *5 (D. Del. Aug. 1, 2022) (finding argument to strike\naffirmative defense of unclean hands was waived where it was raised in a footnote and based on\narguments pertaining to inequitable conduct).\n\nC. Motion to Stay Counterclaims I to IV\n\nPlaintiffs move this court to stay litigation on Counterclaims I to IV. (D.I. 76 at 1) A\n\ncourt has discretionary authority to grant a motion to stay. See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S.\n\n20\n248, 254-55 (1936); Dentsply Int\u2019l Inc. v. Kerr Mfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990).\nCourts consider three factors in deciding how to exercise this discretion: (1) whether a stay will\nsimplify the issues for trial; (2) the status of the litigation, particularly whether discovery is\ncomplete and a trial date has been set; and (3) whether a stay would cause the non-movant to\nsuffer undue prejudice from any delay or allow the movant to gain a clear tactical advantage.\nSee Am. Axle & Manuf., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, C.A. No. 15-1168-LPS, 2021 WL\n616992, at *2 (D. Del. Feb. 17, 2021) (citing Ethicon LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., C.A. No.\n17-871-LPS, 2019 WL 1276029, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2019)). On balance, these factors weigh\nagainst a stay in this case at this time.\n\n1. Simplification of the issues for trial\n\nPlaintiffs identify two ways in which a stay of litigation on Counterclaims I to IV is likely\nto simplify the issues for trial in this matter. First, Plaintiffs argue that ownership challenges to\nthe Counterclaim Patents in the Illumina Action have the potential to impact Guardant\u2019s standing\nto assert the Counterclaim Patents in this action. (D.I. 76 at 8) Second, Plaintiffs suggest that a\nstay would allow the IPR proceedings on the Counterclaim Patents to proceed to institution\ndecisions and possible invalidity determinations, which would narrow the asserted claims of\nthose patents. (D.I. 76 at 11-12; D.I. 86 at 6)\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 first basis for simplification weighs somewhat in favor of granting a stay at this\nstage because a determination regarding the ownership of the Counterclaim Patents in the\nIllumina Action could be dispositive of Counterclaims I to IV in this action. But as Guardant\nexplains, this result is not the only possible outcome. (DJ. 82 at 10-11) A motion to dismiss\nremains pending in the Illumina Action which could nullify Illumina\u2019s ownership challenges to\n\nGuardant\u2019s patents if it is granted. (C.A. No. 22-334-GBW-CJB, D.I. 29) At this juncture, it is\n\n21\nalso speculative to assume that Illumina\u2019s claims will reach a judgment. For these reasons, the\nsimplification factor does not weigh strongly in favor of staying the case.\n\nPlaintiffs cite a number of cases for the proposition that a stay should be granted when\nchallenges to patent ownership are pending in another case. (D.I. 76 at 9) But as Guardant\nexplains, decisions on patent ownership were imminent in each of those cases, whereas the\nIllumina Action was filed well after this case and is not expected to go to trial until nearly a year\nafter the scheduled trial in this case. (See, e.g., D.I. 20; C.A. No. 22-334-GBW-CJB, D.I. 55);\nsee Optimal Golf Sols., Inc. v. Altex Corp., 2009 WL 10733424, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2009)\n(staying case where ownership of patent-in-suit was expected to be addressed by the bankruptcy\ncourt \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d); Innovative Patented Tech., LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 2008 WL\n2726914, at *1 (S.D. Fla. July 10, 2008) (finding a stay appropriate where an earlier-filed case in\nanother district makes a determination of patent ownership).\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 second basis for simplification does not weigh in favor of a stay at this stage\nbecause the PTAB has not yet decided whether to institute IPR proceedings on the Counterclaim\nPatents. See Invensas Corp. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., C.A. No. 17-1363-MN-SRF, 2018 WL\n4762957, at *3 (D. Del. Oct. 2, 2018) (concluding that the issue simplification factor weighs\nagainst a stay before the PTAB issues an institution decision).\n\n2. Status of the litigation\n\nThe stage of the litigation is a neutral factor in this case. \u201cStays are favored when the\n\u2018most burdensome stages of the case\u2014completing discovery, preparing expert reports, filing and\nresponding to pretrial motions, preparing for trial, going through the trial process, and engaging\nin post-trial motions practice\u2014all lie in the future.\u2019\u201d Bio-Rad Lab\u2019ys Inc. v. 10x Genomics, Inc.,\n\nC.A. No. 18-1679-RGA, 2020 WL 2849989, at *1 (D. Del. June 2, 2020). Although expert\n\n22\ndiscovery and pretrial preparations still lie in the future, fact discovery is well underway, experts\nhave been retained, and briefing on claim construction is complete. (D.I. 20 at J 8(H@);\n9/14/2022 Oral Order) Because the requested stay of this case is occasioned by the issues before\nthe court in the Illumina Action, the comparatively early stage of that case also weighs against a\nstay. See Dentsply Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Kerr Mfg. Co., 734 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Del. 1990) (explaining\nthat \u201c[t]he disposition of the earlier case should not be delayed by the later filed litigation.\u201d\n(quoting La Chemise Lacoste v. Alligator Co., Inc., 60 F.R.D. 164, 176 (D. Del. 1973)).\n3. Prejudice\n\nThe third and final factor weighs against a stay because courts generally recognize that\nstaying proceedings between two direct competitors can result in prejudice to the nonmoving\nparty, including the potential for lost market share and the erosion of goodwill. See FMC Corp.\nv. Summit Agro USA, LLC, C.A. No. 14-51-LPS-CJB, 2014 WL 3703629, at *5 (D. Del. July 21,\n2014) (quoting ImageVision.Net, Inc. v. Internet Payment Exch., Inc., C.A. No. 12-54-GMS-\nMPT, 2013 WL 663535, at *6 (D. Del. Feb. 25, 2013)); SenoRx, Inc. v. Hologic, Inc., C.A. No.\n12-173-LPS-CJB, 2013 WL 144255, at *9 (D. Del. Jan. 11, 2013). The fact that Plaintiffs and\nGuardant are not the only participants in the relevant market does not negate this prejudice.\n\u201c(E]ven in cases where there [are] some number of other competitors in the market, so long as\nplaintiff and defendant [are] joint market participants and engaged in some level of competition,\nour Court has tended to find that some amount of potential prejudice is at play.\u201d FMC, 2014 WL\n3703629, at *6.\n\nGuardant also persuasively argues that Plaintiffs will have a clear tactical advantage if\ntheir infringement claims on the Asserted Patents proceed to trial while Counterclaims I to IV\n\nremain paused. (D.I. 82 at 7) Ifthe Illumina Action terminates in a manner favorable to\n\n23\nGuardant, or if the claims in the Illumina Action proceed past the pleading stage, a lengthy stay\nwould prejudice Guardant due to the lost opportunity to enforce its patents and the delay in any\npotential recovery. See Align Tech., Inc. v. 3Shape A/S, C.A. no. 17-1646-LPS-CJB, 2018 WL\n4292675, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 7, 2018). Such prejudice outweighs the other factors for a stay.\n\nOn balance, the stay factors weigh against staying the proceedings with respect to\nCounterclaims I to IV. Therefore, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay,\nwithout prejudice to renew the request in the event that IPR proceedings are instituted or\ndeterminations of patent ownership are reached in the Illumina Action.\n\nD. Motion to Sever Counterclaims I to IV\n\nDuring the oral argument on October 27, 2022, counsel for Plaintiffs confirmed that the\nmotion to sever rises and falls with the outcome of the motion to stay. (10/27/2022 Tr.) Having\nrecommended that the court deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay for the reasons set forth at \u00a7 II.C,\nsupra, | further recommend denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to sever Counterclaims I to IV.\nIl. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT-IN-PART Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Counterclaims V to VIII. (D.I. 38) Specifically, I recommend that\nthe court DENY the motion to dismiss Counterclaims V and VI to the extent that those\ncounterclaims are based on a failure to name the correct inventors under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and\n115. I recommend that the court GRANT the motion to dismiss Counterclaim V to the extent\nthat it is based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135(b), and GRANT the motion to dismiss Counterclaims VII and\nVIII. I further recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike Guardant\u2019s Eighth\n\nand Twelfth Affirmative Defenses and DENY the motion to strike Guardant\u2019s Fourth\n\n24\nAffirmative Defense. Finally, I recommend that the court DENY Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to sever and\nstay Counterclaims I to IV without prejudice. (D.I. 75)\n\nGiven that the court has relied upon material that technically remains under seal, the\ncourt is releasing this Report and Recommendation under seal, pending review by the parties.
