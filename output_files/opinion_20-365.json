(\u201cEton\u201d or \u201cDefendant\u201d).  Eton has filed an \nAbbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(\u201cFDA\u201d) se eking approval to market a generic version (\u201cANDA product\u201d) of Exela\u2019s ELCYS\u00ae \nproduct before expiration of several patents owned by Exela.  Plaintiff alleges that Eton\u2019s ANDA \nproduct will infringe claim 27 of the 10,583,155 patent (\u201cthe \u2019155 patent\u201d), clai ms 8, 9,  and 10 of \nthe 10,905,713 patent (\u201cthe \u2019713 patent\u201d) and claims 1, 19, and 27 of the 10,912,795 patent (\u201cthe \n\u2019795 patent\u201d).  The parties stipulated to infringement of all asserted claims of the \u2019713 and \u2019795 \npatents (D.I. 199), leaving only infringement of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent disputed.  Eton asserts \nthat all asserted claims are invalid.  \nThe Court conducted a three -day bench trial from March 14, 2022 to March 16, 2022.  \n(See D.I. 205- 207 (\u201cTr.\u201d)).  The parties completed post -trial briefing on April 18, 2022.  (D.I. 209, \n212, 220, 222, 228, 229).  With their briefing, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact. (D.I.  210, 211, 221).\n1    \nPursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and after having considered \nthe entire record and the applicable law, the Court concludes that: (1) the ANDA product infringes claims 8, 9 , and 10 of the \u2019713 patent and claims 1, 19, and 27 of the \u2019795 patent; (2) Exela has \nproven that Defendant\u2019s ANDA product directly and contribut orily infringes  and induces \ninfringement of  claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent; ( 3) Eton has failed to prove that claim 27 of the \u2019155 \npatent is invalid as anticipated , and (4) Eton has failed to prove that claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent, \n \n1  Defendant did not submit findings of fact concerning its non- infringement position.  2 claims 8, 9 , and 10 of the \u2019713 patent or  claims 1, 19, and 27 of the \u2019795 patent  are invalid for \nobviousness.  This opinion constitutes the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT  \nA. Introduction \n1. Exela is a limited liability corporation existing under the law s of Delaware, having \nits principal place of business in North Carolina.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 2). \n2. Eton is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware, having its \nprincipal place of business in Illinois.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 4). \n3. Exela owns  the \u2019155, \u2019713, and \u2019795 patents, which are listed in the FDA \npublication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations\u201d ( \u201cthe Orange \nBook\u201d), as having at least one claim that covers Exela\u2019s ELCYS product.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 50). \n4. On December 9, 2019, Eton submitted ANDA No. 214082 to FDA under 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) seeking FDA approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of \nits ANDA product ( i.e., Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP, 500 mg/10 mL (50 mg/mL) Single \nDose Vials).  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 68, 69).  Defendant\u2019s ANDA contains certifications for each of the patents in this case .  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 71).\n2 \nB. Witnesses  \n1. Fact Witnesses  \n5.

The Asserted Patents  \n1. The \u2019155 Patent \n16. The \u2019155 patent  is titled \u201cStable, Highly Pure L -Cysteine Compositions for \nInjection and Methods of Use\u201d and issued on March 10, 2020, from U.S. Patent Application No. 16/665,702, which is a continuation of the \u2019460 Application, filed January 15, 2019, now U.S. Patent  No. 10,478,453.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 12).   The \u2019155 patent claims priority to the \u2019460 \nApplication .  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20). 6 17. The named inventors of the \u2019155 patent are John Maloney, Aruna Koganti, and \nPhanesh Koneru.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 13). \n18. Exela asserts claim 27 of the \u2019155 Patent, which claims:  \nA method of treating a subject having an adverse health condition \nthat is responsive to L -cysteine administration, said method \ncomprising:   parenterally  administering to said subject a parenteral composition \ncomprising a mixture comprising a stable L -cysteine composition, \nwherein said stable L -cysteine composition contribute s to said \nparenteral composition:   a therapeutically effective amount of L -cysteine or a \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and/or hydrate thereof;  \n per Liter of said stable L -cysteine composition, not more than 150 \nmcg of Aluminum;   cystine relative to L -cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt %; and,  \n pyruvic acid relative to L-cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt %.    \n(JTX -2 at 60:15\u201331). \n \n2. The \u2019795 Patent \n19. The \u2019795 patent is titled \u201cStable, highly pure L- cysteine compositions for injection \nand methods of use\u201d and issued on February 9, 2021, from U.S. Patent Application No. 16/850,726 \nfiled on April 16, 2020,  which ultimately (through a series of continuation applications) is a \ncontinuation of the \u2019460 Application.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6  28).  The \u2019795 patent claims priority to \nthe \u2019460 Application.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35).3 \n \n3  The \u2019795 patent erroneously states that A pplication No. 16/773,563 is a continuation- in-\npart of A pplication No. 16/773,641.  The Parent C ontinuity Data for Application \nNo. 16/850,726 available on https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair reflects that \nApplication No. 16/773,563 is a continuation of No. 16/773,641, which is consistent with \nthe domestic priority as claimed by Exela in the file  history.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 28 n.1). 7 20. The named inventors of the \u2019795 patent are listed as John Maloney, Aruna Koganti, \nand Phanesh Kone ru.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 29). \n21. Exela asserts claims 1, 19 , and 27 of the \u2019795 patent.  Claim 1 claims:  \nA solution of L -cysteine comprising,  \n \na pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and  \n about 50 mg/mL of L -cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, or  \n equivalent amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable L -cysteine or a \nsalt or hydrate thereof;  \n wherein the solution is stored in a single -use vial;  \n wherein for at least 12 months from the time of manufacture of the  \nsolution, the solution will remain:   substantially free of visually detectable particulate matter, at a pH from about 1.0 to 2.5, and   containing no more than 150 ppb of aluminum; and   wherein the solution is safe for use as an additive in a parenteral \nnutrition composition for intravenous administration to an individual for at least 12 months from the time of manufacture of the solution  \n \n(JTX -5 at 58:34\u201349).  \n22. Claim 19, which depends from claim 1, claims : \nThe solution of claim 1, wherein for at  least 24 months from the time \nof manufacture of the solution, the solution will remain:   substantially free of visually detectable particulate matter, at a pH from about 1.0 to 2.5, and   containing no more than 150 ppb of aluminum; and  wherein the solution is safe for use as an additive in a parenteral nutrition composition for intravenous administration to an individual for  at least 24 months from the time of manufacture of \nthe solution.  8 (JTX -5 at 60:11\u201324).  \n23. Claim 27 , which also depends from claim 1, c laims : \nThe solution of claim 1, wherein for at least 24 months from the time \nof manufacture of the solution, the solution will remain:   substantially free of visually detectable particulate matter, at a pH from about 1.0 to 2.5, and   containing no more than 150 ppb of aluminum; and  wherein the solution is safe for use as an additive in a parenteral nutrition composition for intravenous administration to an individual for at least 24 months from the time of manufacture of the solution. \n \n(JTX -5 at 60:38-48). \n \n3. The \u2019713 Patent \n24. The \u2019713 patent is titled \u201cStable, highly pure L- cysteine compositions for injection \nand methods of use\u201d and issued on February 2, 2021, from U.S. Patent Application No. 16/773,641 \nfiled January 27, 2020.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 21).  Like the \u2019155 and \u2019795 patents, the \u2019713 patent is \nultimately a continuation of the \u2019460 Application, and claims priority to that application.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27). \n25. The named inventors of the \u2019713 patent are listed as John Maloney, Aruna Koganti, \nand Phanesh Koneru.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 22). \n26. Exela asserts claims 8, 9 , and 10 of the \u2019713 patent.  These terms depend from \nunasserted claim 1, which recites:  \nA solution of L- cysteine comprising,  \n \na pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,  \n about 50 mg/mL of L -cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, or \nequivalent amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable L -cysteine or a \nsalt or hydrate thereof, 9 a pharmaceutically acceptable amount of cystine for at least about \n12 months from the time of manufacture of the solution,   less than about 150 ppb of aluminum for at least about 12 months from the time of manufacture of the solution,   a pH from about 1.0 to about 2.5, and   wherein the solution is enclosed in a single- use vial.  \n \n(JTX -4 at 60:52\u201364).  \n 27. Claims 8 through 10 add:  \n8. The solution of claim 1, further comprising lead in an amount \nfrom about 1 ppb to about 10 ppb.  9. The solution of claim 1, further comprising mercury in an amount from about 0.2 ppb to about 5.0 ppb.   10. The solution of claim 9, further comprising lead in an amount from about 1 ppb to about 10 ppb.  \n(JTX -4 at 61:9\u201314). \n \nD. ELCYS\u00ae \n28. Exela is the holder of N DA No. 210660, submitted on July 27, 2018, which sought \nFDA approval for the marketing and sale of ELCYS, an injectable L -cysteine hydrochloride \nproduct containing low aluminum levels.  The FDA approved the NDA for ELCYS  on \nApril  16, 2019.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 48, 49).   \n29. ELCYS is a stable solution of L -cysteine hydrochloride indicated for use as an \nadditive to amino acid solutions to meet the nutritional requirements for patients requiring TPN .  \n(D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 57). \n30. TPN is a method of providing, via an intravenous solution, nutrients such as amino \nacids, carbohydrates, electrolytes, pediatric multivitamins and fats  to patients who cannot feed 10 orally.  (Tr. 73:1\u20137, 78:11\u201379:22).  TPN provides all needed calories and manag es electrolytes and \nfluids .  (Tr. 75:14\u201322).  \n31. TPN is primarily used for neonates (children who are less than thirty days old), \nincluding premature infants and children who cannot use their gut to obtain the calories they need.  \nIn the United States, there are approximately 4,000 to 6,000 neonates receiving TPN on a given \nday.  (Tr. 75:14\u201376:15).   \n32. Neonat es cannot make certain amino acids, such as cysteine, which are necessary \nfor their growth and development.  Accordingly, formulations of amino acids that include cysteine need to be  added into their TPN solutions.  (Tr. 76:16\u201377:4, 79:15\u201322).  \n33. TPN solutions with toxins present a significant risk to neonat es because they are \nsmall and have undeveloped kidneys.  (Tr. 77:5\u201313).  \n34. Aluminum , a common impurity in TPN solutions , is toxi c to neonatal patients.  \n(Tr. 80:12\u201317).  Cysteine is known to contribute aluminum  levels in TPN solutions .  (Tr. 81:16\u2013\n22). \n35. Two other known impurities in cysteine products are cystine and pyruvic acid, \nwhich are both degradation products of cysteine.  (Tr. 164:14\u201317).   \n36. ELCYS contains 50 mg/mL of cysteine hydrochloride (equivalent to 34.5 mg/mL \nof cysteine) in water for injection.  The chemical name of cysteine hydrochloride is cysteine \nhydrochloride monohydrate.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 58). \n37. ELCYS contains no more than 120 mcg/L (or 120 ppb)\n4 of aluminum.  Stability \ntesting of ELCYS shows that its registration batches contained between 6 ppb and 9 ppb of \n \n4  The measurement units \u201cmcg\u201d (micrograms per liter) and \u201cppb\u201d (parts per billion) are \nequivalent and are used interchangeably throughout this opinion.  (Tr. 17:6\u20137, 138:4\u20137,  \n331:22\u201323).  11 aluminum throughout its 24- month shelf life when stored at 25\u00b0C and 60% relative humidity.  \n(D.I.  177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 59).  \n38. ELCYS contains no more than 1.0 wt %  of cystine.  Stability testing of ELCYS \nshows that its exhibit batches contained between 0.2% and 0.8% of cystine throughout its 24-\nmonth shelf life when stored at 25\u00b0C and 60% relative humidity and remained essentially free of visible particulate matter.  In approving ELCYS, the FDA concluded that it contains a \npharmaceutically acceptable amount of cystine.  The cystine present in ELC YS forms as a result \nof oxidation.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 60).  \n39. ELCYS contains pyruvic acid, in an amount of no more than 1.0 wt %  relative to \ncysteine, as set forth in the NDA\u2019s release and stability specifications for the product, which provide for no more t han 0.5% of two specified impurities attributable to pyruvic acid (RRT 0.56 \nand 0.76) throughout the 24- month shelf life of the product.  The pyruvic acid present in ELCYS \nforms as a result of, for example, oxidation of cysteine.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 61). \n40. ELCYS contains headspace oxygen between 1.9% and 2.3% at release and between \n0.9%  and 2.8% one month from manufacture when stored at room temperature, and dissolved \noxygen between 0.39 and 1.59 ppm at release, and between 0.51 and 1.04 ppm one month from manufacture when stored at room temperature.  (D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6 62).  \n41. ELCYS is a commercial embodiment of all asserted claims of the \u2019795 patent and \nthe \u2019713 patent.  (D.I. 201 \u00b6 6).  ELCYS is also a commercial embodiment of claim 27 of the \u2019155 \npatent.\n5 \n \n5  Eton contests that ELCYS is an embodiment of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent based on its \nproposed construction of \u201c pyruvic acid relative to L -cysteine not more than about 2.0 \nwt%. \u201d  The pretrial order\u2019s statement of undisputed facts , however, specifies that ELCYS \ncontains pyruvic acid in an amount of no more than 1.0 wt %  relative to cysteine.   (D.I. 177, \nEx. 1 \u00b6 61). Moreover, i n light of the Court\u2019s construction of the pyruvic acid limitation  12 E. Exela\u2019s Development of ELCYS \n42. The \u2019 155, \u2019713, and \u2019795 patents  arose from Exela\u2019s development of ELCYS.   \n(Tr. 196:6\u20138).  \n43. Exela\u2019s development of ELCYS reflects the complex nature of developing a low -\naluminum L -cysteine product with a safe impurity profile.  \n44. In October 2015, Exela first reached out to the FDA about pursuing a n NDA for a \ncysteine hydrochloride solution.  (Tr. 157:9\u201316, JTX -13.11181).   \n45. Prior to October 2015, Exela had periodically made cysteine solutions during drug \nshortages upon hospital reque sts.  (JTX -13.11230, Tr. 158:9\u2013159:4, 160:25\u2013161:2, 162:12\u2013163:1).  \nThe cysteine product that Exela manufactured during this period had a shelf life of only three \nmonths, underwent limited testing, and had high levels of impurities such as cystine and pyruvic acid.  (Tr. 161:21\u2013162:11, 163:25\u2013164:21). \n46. Exela believed that the aluminum levels in its prior product, which measured at \naround 400 ppb, were satisfactory, but that its impurity levels were too high.  (Tr. 163:13\u201324). Accordingly, Exela set out to reduce its product\u2019s impurity profile.  (Tr. 163:25\u2013164:5).  \n47. To th at end, Exela implemented strict oxygen controls throughout its \nmanufacturing process because it believed that impurities result from the degradation of cysteine due to oxidization.  (JTX -13.10000- 10001, Tr. 164:9\u201313, 164:22\u2013165:20, 385:3\u2013386:1).  \nSpecifically, Exela (1) used an argon overlay to limit the dissolved oxygen content to no more than 1 ppm throughout the mixing process, with dissolved oxygen measurements taken at four steps \nduring the mixing process, (2) removed oxygen at the holding stage, between mixing and vial \n \n(infra  at \u00a7 III.A ), ELCYS meets this limitation f or the same reasons that Eton\u2019s ANDA \nproduct does.  Thus, ELCYS is a commercial embodiment of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent. 13 filling, and (3) removed headspace oxygen by using a series of argon flushes and vacuum pulses.  \n(JTX -13.10000\u201310001).   \n48. Exela\u2019s strict oxygen controls resulted in total impurities of 0.4%, with cystine at \n0.3%.  (JTX -13.7914, Tr. 172:6\u201325).  \n49. After six months of storage, Exela\u2019s initial product contained aluminum levels \nranging from 550 to 750 ppb, and under accelerated conditions intending to simulate a two- year \nshelf life, the aluminum levels ranged from about 1,000 to 1,400 ppb.  (JTX -13.7911\u20137916, \nTr. 176:2\u2013176: 6).  \n50. The FDA informed Exela that its NDA was not approvable because t he aluminum \nlevels were unacceptable.  (Tr. 176:7\u201325).  The FDA later told Exela that an approvable product \nmust have an aluminum level less than or equal to 145 mcg.  (PTX -486; Tr. 183:21\u2013184:3). \n51. Exela thus committed to reducing the aluminum levels.  To do so, Exela maintained \nits oxygen controls but altered its process in two ways.  First, Exela bottled its formulation in \nplastic containers b ecause, as it explained to the FDA, \u201c[i]t is believed that the glass containers \ncontribute significantly to aluminum levels in the drug product.\u201d  (JTX -13.11962, Tr. 179:7\u2013\n181:18).  Second, Exela sourced its cysteine from a different vendor which provided product with \nlower aluminum levels.  (JTX -13.11336, Tr. 182:20\u2013183:1).  \n52. Exela\u2019s new ly sour ced cysteine and plastic vials resulted in significantly reduced \ninitial aluminum levels.  (JTX -13.11336, Tr. 181:4\u20136, 182:2\u2013183:1).  O ne month into stability \ntesting, however, the product contained visible particulate matter.  (JTX -13.11801, Tr. 184:15\u2013\n24).  Exela discovered that the particulates were L -cystine, a degradation product that results from \nthe oxidation of L -cysteine.  (JTX -13.11801).  14 53. Exela hypothesized that the particulates arose because of oxidation that occurred in \nthe plastic vials despite the use of strict oxygen controls.  (Tr. 186:5\u201310, 188:7\u201315).  As a result,  \nExela decided to use Schott Type I Plus glass vials  instead  while maintaining its manufacturing \nprocess. (JTX-13.11802\u201311803).6   \n54. Schott Type I Plus glass vials had been in use since the early 2000s.  (Tr. 498:2\u20137).  \nBut at the time  Exela decided to use them , there was no data on this vial\u2019s performance with a \nproduct having cysteine\u2019s low pH (1.0 to 2.5) or affinity for leaching.  (Tr. 189:3\u2013190:13, see JTX-\n13.11804\u201311811). \n55. After six months, the product in the Schott Type I Plus vials maintained aluminum \nlevels well below FDA\u2019s stated maximum of 145 mcg/L and did not generate particulate matter .  \n(JTX -13.1788\u20131789, Tr. 192:15\u2013194:10). \n56. Exela attributed its success in reducing particulate matter to the unexpected and \ncounterintuitive realization that aluminum protects cysteine, and so when aluminum is reduced too \nmuch it permits cysteine to degrade into cystine.  Put simply, aluminum has a stabilizing effect on \nan L-cysteine solution.  (Tr. 197:19\u2013198:15, 199:2\u2013200:13). \nF. Person of Skill in the Art  \n57. Plaintiff\u2019s experts defined a person of ordinary skill in the art (\u201cPOS A\u201d) as a person \nhaving: \nA Pharm. D., or M.S. or Ph.D. in chemistry, chemical engineering, \nor a related field; has three or more years of experience in developing aqueous drug formulations; and has access to other scientists to collaborate and consult with on, for example, characterizing the drug formulation, manufacture of the drug \n \n6  As Exela was  apparently  not confident that the Schott Type I Plus vials would work to both \nmaintain low aluminum levels for the tw o-year shelf life and avoid precipitates, it \nconsidered other options as well.  ( See, e.g., Tr. 190:14-191:9, 228.10-230:2, JTX-\n13.11803).  15 formulation, and clinical use and effect of the drug formulation. \nPractical experience, either in industry or academia, can compensate for less or different formal education, and additional formal \neducation can compensate for less practical experience.  \n \n(D.I. 179, Ex. 1 \u00b6 45, Tr. 242:8\u201320, 560:15\u201325). \n58. Defendant\u2019s expert defined the POSA as:  \nA person having \u201ca bachelor\u2019s degree in pharmacy or a related field, along with five years of practical experience in drug formation or a related field. In addition, a [POSA] may have a graduate degree in pharmacy or a related field and three years of practical experience in drug formulation or a related field.\u201d  \n(D.I. 179, Ex. 1 \u00b6 46, Tr. 407:18\u2013408:2). \n59. Plaintiff\u2019s experts, Drs. Schoneich and Jenke, and Defendant\u2019s expert, \nDr. Baertschi, agreed that their opinions would not change regardless of which definition of a \nPOSA were used.  (Tr. 242:22\u2013243:3, 408:4\u201316, 561:10\u201315). \n60. Drs. Schoneich, Jenke , and Baertschi all meet the minimum qualifications of a \nPOSA under both proposals.  ( Supra \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13, 15 ). \nG. Facts Relevant to Infringement  \n1. The \u2019713 and \u2019795 Patents \n61. The parties stipulated that Eton\u2019s ANDA product , as described in ANDA \nNo. 214082, meets all of the limitations of claims 1, 19 , and 27 of the \u2019795 patent and claims 8, 9, \nand 10 of the \u2019713 patent , and thus infringes those claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2).  (D.I. 199).   \n2. Claim 27 of the \u2019155 Patent \n62. The part ies agreed that Eton\u2019s ANDA product  described in ANDA No. 214082 \nmeets all  of the  limitations of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent except one: \u201cper Liter of said stable L -16 cysteine composition, . . . pyruvic acid relative to L -cysteine no more than about 2.0 wt %.\u201d (\u201cthe \npyruvic acid limitation\u201d) .  (D.I. 201) .7 \n63. The parties also agreed that , if the Court finds that the ANDA product  described in \nANDA No. 214082 meets the pyruvic acid limitation , then that product  together with Et on\u2019s \nproposed labeling described in ANDA No. 214082, infringes claim 27 of  the \u2019155 patent under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2).  ( Id.). \n64. The parties further agreed that, if the ANDA product described in ANDA \nNo. 214082 meets the pyruvic acid limitation, then the AN DA product induces infringement of \nclaim 27 under 35. U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b) and contributes to the  infringement of claim 27 under 35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 271(c) based on the act of direct  infringement found pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2).  ( Id.). \n65. The dispute about the pyruvic acid limitation is whether the claim covers a product \ncontaining no pyruvic acid . \n66. There is no real dispute that Eton\u2019s ANDA product meets the limitation if zero \npyruvic acid is included.  Eton asserts that its product has not been proven to include a ny pyruvic \nacid.  (D.I. 220 at 1\u20133, D.I. 212 at 28 (\u201cEton does not believe that any pyruvic acid exists in its \nproposed ANDA product\u201d)).  Exela points out that the acceptance criteria in the finished product \nstability specification for Eton\u2019s ANDA product requires that the ANDA product contain \u201ctotal \nimpurities\u201d of \u22642.0%.  (JTX -14.11951, Tr. 247:1\u20139).  Exela asserts that as pyruvic acid is an \n \n7  In its reply brief, Eton notes that it received FDA approval for its ANDA product on \nApril  8, 2022.  It then states \u201c[i]n the event that Eton launches its products at risk, Exela \ncannot meet its burden to show that Eton\u2019s proposed ANDA product infringes  the [asserted \nclaims]\u201d because it asserts that the ANDA product \u201cdoes not maintain 150 ppb aluminum \nfor 6 or 12 months  following manufacture.\u201d  (D.I. 220 at 1).  Eton, however, has not \nlaunched its product and there is no evidence in the  trial record supporting Eton\u2019s claim as \nto the aluminum content.  17 impurity, if the total amount of impurities cannot exceed 2.0%, then the amount of one impurity \n(pyruvic acid) can certainly not exceed 2.0%.  (Tr. 250:6\u201316). \n67. Based on the Court\u2019s construction of \u201cpyruvic acid relative to L -cysteine not more \nthan about 2.0 wt % \u201d (infra , \u00a7 III.A),  which includes  a composition having no pyruvic acid, Eton\u2019s \nANDA product contains no more than about 2.0 wt %  of pyruvic acid relative to L- cysteine. \n68. Eton\u2019s ANDA product, thus, meets all of the limitations of claim 27.  \nH. Facts Relevant to Invalidity \n1. The Prior Art  \na. The Sandoz Product  \n69. Allergy Lab s manufactured an L -cysteine product for Sandoz ( \u201cthe Sandoz \nproduct\u201d) on a contract basis from 2003 to 2016.  (Tr. 293:13\u201324).  Throughout that time, Allergy \nLabs followed the same manufacturing process and specification.  (Tr. 378:3\u20139).  \n70. The Sandoz product contained three ingredients: cysteine hydrochloride (the active \ningredient), water and a pH adjuster, such as hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide, if needed.  (DTX 54.19-20, Tr. 161:3\u20136, 161:17\u201320, 296:17\u201323).   \n71. The Sandoz product was sold from 2003 to 2016.  (Tr. 293:13\u201324, 378:3\u20139, 301:1\u2013\n3).   \n72. The Sandoz product was not FDA approved.  (PTX -191.6, Tr. 105:11\u201312, 296:3\u2013\n8).  It was nevertheless sold because the FDA permits the making and selling of  unapproved \nproducts that are in short supply.  (Tr. 159:1\u20134).  \n73. The label for the Sandoz product states that it contains no more than 5,000 mcg/L \nof aluminum and contains a warning that \u201c[t]his product contains aluminum that may be toxic.\u201d  (PTX -191.2, .5).   18 74. One of ordinary skill would understand that the Sandoz product could contain as \nmuch as 5,000 ppb of aluminum at product expiration, and that it would put patients at risk to \nassume a lower level of aluminum.  (Tr. 505:21\u2013506:2, see also Tr. 95:16- 96:13 (pharmacists use \nthe maximum concentration of aluminum at expiry because it is the only number they have) ).   \n75. A product containing 5,000 ppb of aluminum  would result in aluminum exposure \nof 14 m cg/kg per day, more than twice the limit set by the FDA .  (Tr. 106:6\u2013107:1). \n76. The aluminum levels in the Sandoz product, as demonstrated by certificat es of \nanalysis, increased over time.  For example, a certificate of analysis for a 50 mL vial showed a \nvalue of 48 ppb aluminum near the time of manufacture and values of 407 and 362 ppb about 24 months from manufacture.  (DTX -124.001\u2013003, Tr. 570:6\u2013571:20).  \n77. Moreover, the aluminum levels varied across lots of the Sandoz product.  (PTX -\n194 (summary of Allergy Labs certificates of analysis) , PTX -195 (summary of Sandoz Canada \ncertificates of analysis) , Tr. 148:22- 149:7, 506:10- 16).  For example , at seven months after the \ndate of manufacture, one lot shows aluminum levels of 580 ppb and another lot shows aluminum levels of 213 ppb.  (PTX -195.3). \n78. Aluminum levels also varied within the same lot.  For example, measurements from \ntwo vials in the same lot twenty -four months after manufacture (362 ppb and 407 ppb of aluminum) \nshow that \u201cthe aluminum content on a vial -to-vial basis is somewhat variable.\u201d  (DTX -124.2\u2013.3,  \nTr. 571:5\u201310).  \n79. Despite the fact that  the Sandoz product  contained high levels of alum inum , doctors \nused it because they had no other option.  (Tr. 107:22\u2013109:5). \n80. None of the Allergy Labs certificates of analysis for the Sandoz product reference \namounts of cystine, pyruvic acid, lead or mercury, but no certificate of analysis in the record 19 discloses total impurity levels greater than  2%.  (DTX- 123, DTX- 124, DTX- 125, PTX -194, PTX -\n195, Tr. 462:25\u2013463:3).   \n81. Allergy Labs\u2019 s manufacture of the Sandoz product is reflected in batch records, \nonly one of which was introduced at trial as part of DTX -54A (hereafter \u201cthe Sandoz Product \nBatch Record\u201d).   (Tr. 297:5\u2013298:8).8   \n82. Page 46 of DTX -54, entitled \u201cFilled Vial Labelling Record\u201d appears to depict the \nlabel included with the package.  That label states that it is a \u201cPharmacy Bulk Package\u201d \nconfiguration, a 50 mL size product.  (DTX -54.046). \n83. The Sandoz Product Batch Record does not identify the supplier of the cysteine \nhydrochloride  or the amount of aluminum in that cysteine hydrochloride .  (See DTX -54).   \n84. Allergy Labs\u2019 s process for making the Sandoz product  begins with Step 1 on DTX -\n54.022, and concludes with Step 19 on DTX -54.025.  (Tr. 318:18\u2013319:25).  \n85. Allergy Labs did not employ oxygen controls (such as nitrogen sparging, use of a \nnitrogen blanket during manufacturing and filling, or dissol ved or headspace oxygen \nmeasurements) in manufacturing the Sandoz product.  (Tr. 320:1\u201310).   \n86. Allergy Labs did not terminally sterilize the Sandoz product.  (Tr. 320:13\u201315, DTX-\n54.029\u2013.033). \n87. There is no indication which glass vial Allergy Labs used to cont ain the Sandoz \nproduct .  The Sandoz Product Batch Record does not identify the container used other than noting \nit wa s a 50 mL 20mm Clear Glass Vial.  (DTX -54.026). \n \n8  The Sandoz Product Batch Record includes dates between 2013 and 2016, but no \nexplanation of the various dates was provided at trial.  It is, however,  not disputed that any \nSandoz product sold was prior art  (though the parties dispute whether Eton has established \nthe characteristics of any Sandoz product that was actually sold) . 20 88. Around July 20, 2016, there was a recall of the Sandoz product ( manufactured by \nAllergy Lab s), resulting in Sandoz being unable to supply the market.  As a result of the recall, \nSandoz began importing product manufactured in Canada.  (Tr. 160:10\u201316, JTX-13.11224).  No \nevidence about the Canadian- made product\u2019s manufacturing process is in the rec ord. \n89. In 2016, Sandoz sought (but did not obtain) FDA approval for a cysteine product \nby filing an ANDA .  (PTX -308.1\u20132, Tr. 507:23\u201325).  \n90. In May 2019, Sandoz reached out to Exela and asked for, but did not receive, a \nlicense to market an L -cysteine product.  (Tr. 200:18\u2013202:11, 508:5\u201313, PTX -490).  \nb. The Abbo tt Product  \n91. Dr. Hoffstetter testified that when he worked at Abbott in the early 1990s, he \nworked on an L -cysteine injectable product .  (Tr. 290:7\u2013291:1).  He recalled that the product \ningredients were \u201cjust the L -cysteine drug, the API, and . . . water for injection\u201d and  it was \ncontained in a Type I U.S.D class vial .  (Tr. 292:2\u201311).  T here was, however, no meaningful detail \nprovided about the specific method of manufacturing the product, the amount of aluminum \ncontained at any given time, or the amounts of other impurities or precipitates.   \nc. Bohrer Papers (PTX -227, PTX-228, PTX-271) \n92. Dr. Denise Bohrer and colleagues published several papers addressing aluminum \nleaching in TPN products.  (PTX -227, PTX -228, PTX -271).  These papers illustrate that a number \nof different variables, including affinity for aluminum, time, temperature, pH , and oxygen affect \nthe amount of aluminum leaching. \n93. In Influence of the glass packing on the contamination of pharmaceutical products \nby aluminum.  Part II: Amino acids for parenteral nutrition, published in volume 15 of the Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology in 2001 (\u201cBohrer 2001\u201d), Dr. Bohrer measured the 21 amount of aluminum leache d from glass containers with solutions of amino acids typically found \nin parenteral products.  (PTX -227).  \n94. Bohrer 2001 found that cysteine had the highest affinity for aluminum of the amino \nacids tested.  (PTX -227.4 (Figure 2) ).  Cystine, a degradation product of cysteine, had the next \nhighest affinity for aluminum.  ( Id.).  Lysine, another amino acid not found in L -cysteine products, \nwas found to have the lowest affinity for aluminum.  ( Id.). \n95. Bohrer 2001 further demonstrated that the aluminum leaching conti nues to increase \nover time, and, even after almost a year, it continues to rise.  (PTX -227.4 (Figure 2 )).  Thus, the \ntime that amino acid solutions are in contact with glass affects how much aluminum is leached.  \n96. In Influence of the glass packing on the contamination of pharmaceutical products \nby aluminum. Part III: Interaction container -chemicals during the heating for sterilization,  \npublished in the Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology in 2003 (\u201cBohrer 2003\u201d), \nDr. Bohrer found that temperature  influences the amount of aluminum leaching. \n97. Bohrer 2003 found that sterilization by heat increases the ability of all amino acids \nto leach aluminum  \u201cdramatically.\u201d  (PTX -228.5, Tr. 590:4\u2013590:19) .  Of the amino acids tested, \nBohrer 2003 found that steriliz ation by heat most increases cysteine and cystine\u2019s capacity to leach .  \n(Id.). \n98. Another Bohrer paper, Ion- Exchange and potentiometric characterization of Al -\ncystine and Alcysteine complexes , discloses that aluminum leaching persists longer if it is exposed \nto oxygen than if it is not exposed to oxygen.  (PTX -271).  Specifically , Bohrer looked at two \nformulations of cysteine that differed only in the amount of oxygen present and found that \naluminum leaching behavior persisted longer when oxygen was present than when it was not. \n(PTX -271.4; Tr. 593:2\u201320) .  The record does not indicate when this paper was published. 22 d. Hernandez- Sanchez (PTX -152/DTX-409) \n99. In Aluminum in parenteral nutrition: a system atic review , published in the \nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2013 (\u201cHernandez -Sanchez\u201d) , Dr. Hernandez -Sanchez \nand co -authors gathered and reported information related to aluminum in parenteral nutrition \nproducts.  (PTX-152). \n100. Hernandez- Sanchez r eports in the abstract that the \u201c Alumin ium (Al) toxicity \nproblem in parenteral nutrition solutions (PNS) is decades old and is still unresolved.\u201d  (PTX -\n152.1). \n101. Hernandez- Sanchez identified cysteine hydrochloride as one of the three largest \ncontributors of aluminum to TPN solutions.  (PTX -152.2, Tr. 101:25\u2013102:9).    \n102. Hernandez- Sanchez recommended that, to reduce aluminum in TPN solutions, \nmanufacturers should improve manufacturing techniques, and healthcare providers should do their \nbest to try minimizing al uminum exposure in TPN solutions by selecting products with the least \namount of aluminum contamination.  (PTX -152.8, Tr. 102:24\u2013103:12).  Hernandez -Sanchez did \nnot, however, recommend how manufacturers should improve their manufacturing techniques to provide low aluminum products.  (PTX -152.8, Tr. 103:13\u201316).   \n103. Hernandez- Sanchez explains, as Bohrer 2001 did, that one source of aluminum is \nglass  and instructs that parenteral pr oducts \u201cshould be stored in containers that do not interact \nphysically or chemically with the preparations.\u201d  (PTX -152.2). \n104. Hernandez- Sanchez teach es away from using glass vials, reporting that \n\u201crepackaging CaGluc from glass containers to polyethylene vials  reduces the mean Al \nconcentration from 5000 to 195 mg/l (a 96% decrease).\u201d  ( Id.). 23 105. Hernandez- Sanchez also discloses \u201chigh lot -to-lot variation\u201d in aluminum content \nin TPN products.  (PTX-152.1). \ne. U.S. Patent No. 8,415,337 (\u201cthe \u2019337 patent\u201d) (DTX -523) \n106. The \u2019337 patent , entitled \u201cIbuprofen Compositions and Methods Of Making Same ,\u201d \nissued April 9, 2013.  (DTX -523).  The \u2019337 patent relates to pharmaceutical compositions of \nalkylammonium salts of ibuprofen, such as ibuprofen lysinate and processes for making them.  \n107. The \u2019337 patent addresses the problem of aluminum and lysine combining to form \na precipitate.  ( Tr. 608:16 \u201321).  To deal with this problem, the \u2019337 patent recommends the use of \nvials like the Schott Type I Plus vial, which it specifically names.  (DTX -523 at  5:15\u201320). \n108. Precipitation of aluminum is not an issue with cysteine solutions.  (Tr. 609:1\u20133).  \n109. Lysine also differs from cysteine  in terms of aluminum affinity .  As discussed supra \n\u00b6 94, Bohrer 2001 found that of the eight amino acids tested, cysteine has the most affinity for \naluminum and lysine has the least affinity for aluminum.  (PTX-227.4).   \n110. The pH of the lysine mixture in the \u2019337 patent is about 7.0.  (DTX -523 at 3:36\u2013\n37, 5:61\u201362).  This is markedly different than the pH of the cysteine formulation  of the asserted \nclaims, which is 1\u20132.5.  (Tr. 590:20\u2013592:22).  \nf. Schott Type I Plus Brochure (JTX -13.11804\u201311811) \n111. The Schott Type I Plus vial, described in its brochure at JTX -13N at JTX -\n13.11804\u201311811 (\u201cthe Schott brochure\u201d), has been on the market since the early 2000s.  \n(Tr. 498:2\u20137, 190:11\u201313). \n112. The Schott brochure advertises the Schott Type I Plus coated glass vial for the \npurposes of reducing aluminum leaching.  (JTX -13N.11805 (\u201cBarrier layer prevents depletion of 24 glass container by drug formulation\u201d; \u201cThanks to our patented coating technology, a very high \nbarrier improvement factor against ion leaching is achieved\u201d)).   \n113. The brochure reports an \u201cimprovement factor\u201d of more than 45 in terms of \naluminum leaching.  ( JTX-13N.11804). \n114. The Schott brochure does not contain any information specific to cysteine products  \nand suggests individually testing a given product\u2019s fit for the  vial.  ( JTX-13N .11806 (\u201cThese \nindividual interactions have to be investigated typically during stability studies for the specific pharmaceutical products in the frame of the registration procedure.\u201d)). \n2. Anticipation of Claim 27 of the \u2019155 Patent Based on the Sandoz Product  \n115. Eton offers two reasons why the Sandoz product anticipates claim 27 of the \u2019155 \npatent.  First, Eton argues that the Sandoz product is the same as the Eton product and, therefore, \nanticipates claim 27 if Eton\u2019s product infringes  that cla im.  Second, Eton asserts that it has proven \non an element -by-element basis that the prior art Sandoz product met all limitation s of claim 27. \na. Differences Between the ANDA Product and Sandoz Product  \n116. Eton contends that its ANDA product is the same as the Sandoz product  \nmanufactured by Allergy Labs.  (D.I. 212 at 7\u201314).  \n117. When Sandoz opted not to continue selling a cysteine product, Allergy Labs, the \nmanufacturer of the Sandoz product, sought to market its own product.  (Tr. 3 77:10\u201316).  To that \nend, it created AL Pharma and filed an NDA for a cysteine product  (\u201cthe AL Pharma product\u201d) .  \n(Tr. 306:11\u201320).  When the NDA was not approved, AL Pharma converted the application to an \nANDA and filed in Eton\u2019s name , i.e., the ANDA that is the subject of this suit.  (Tr. 308:2\u2013309:12).  \n118. A cysteine \u201cproduct is the [] solution . . .  in a container, manufactured by a \nprocess[.]\u201d   (Tr. 583:12\u201315).   25 119. The ingredients, container , and manufacturing process differ between the Sandoz \nproduct and the ANDA product .  As is demonstrated below, altering the source of ingredients, \ncontainer of a solution, or certain steps in the manufacturing process can alter the cysteine product . \ni. Differences in the Manufacturing Process  \n120. The manufacturing process for the Sandoz product differs from the manufacturing \nprocess to make the AL Pharma product and the ANDA product.   \n121. The Sandoz product was manufactured by Allergy Labs.  (Tr. 293:21\u201324, 378:3\u2013\n6).  The ANDA product is manufactured by Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing (\u201cGRAM\u201d) .  \n(D.I. 177, Ex. 1 \u00b6\u00b6  73, 74, JTX -14.201). \n122. The process used to make Eton\u2019s ANDA product use s terminal sterilization.  (DTX -\n568.024\u2013025, 041\u201342, Tr. 304:8\u201324, 305:15\u201322, JTX-14.194\u201395, 212\u201313).  The process used to \nmake the Sandoz product did not use terminal sterilization.  (Tr. 320:13\u201315, DTX-54.029\u2013.033). \n123. Terminal sterilization uses heat to sterilize a product.  ( Tr. 304:25\u2013305:3).  As \ndescribed above in \u00b6\u00b6 96-97, heat increases the rate aluminum leaches from glass vials a s well as \ncysteine\u2019 s capacity for leaching aluminum.  (PTX -228.5, Tr. 590:4\u2013590:19).  T erminal \nsterilization also increase s degradation products like pyruvic acid.  (Tr. 493:17-19, 511:21\u2013512:9).   \n124. Additionally, Allergy Labs did not use oxygen controls in making the Sandoz \nproduct.  (Tr. 320:5\u20139).  The process used to make Eton\u2019s ANDA product, however, employs \nvarious manufacturing controls to limit the amount of oxygen exposed to the solution.  These \ninclude nitrogen sparging, us ing a nitrogen blanket during manufacturing and filling, and requir ing \nthat the dissolved oxygen in the water both not exceed 1 ppm before cysteine is added and be \nbelow 5 ppm at the conclusion of the mixing step, and requires headspace oxygen in the vial to be 26 not more than 5.0%.  (DTX -568.016, JTX-14.194, .10344, .10369, Tr. 328:2\u2013329:5, 334:23\u2013\n335:16).   \n125. Oxygen controls affect the formation of precipitates.  When aluminum is reduced \nto very low levels in a cysteine product, small amounts of oxygen in the container can increase \nprecipitation and lead to product failure.  (Tr. 197:5\u2013198:15, 199:7\u2013200:16, supra \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52).  \nMoreover, aluminum leaching will persist longer in the presence of oxygen.  (PTX-271).   \nii. Other Differences  \n126. The supplier of the active ingredient, cysteine hydrochloride, differs between the \nSandoz product and the ANDA product.  Allergy Labs used cysteine hydrochloride from Kyowa \nHakko Bio to make the Sandoz product.9  (PTX -653.605, Tr. 307:7\u201316).  The ANDA product \ncysteine hydrochloride is supplied by Nippon Protein.  (JTX -14.186). \n127. The active pharmaceutical ingredient can impact the end product because the raw \nmaterials used to make the product are a source of impurities.  (Tr. 354:18 \u2013355:2).  For e xample, \nto lower aluminum content during development of ELCYS, Exela switched suppliers of cysteine hydrochloride to a supplier that offered the product with lower aluminum content than its previous \nsource.  (Tr. 204:8\u201317).   \n128. There is scant  evidence in the record about the aluminum content of the cysteine \nsupplied by Kyowa compared to that of Nippon Protein, or whether any such differences matter in terms of whether claim limitations are met.  (Tr. 307:7\u2013308:1). \n \n9  At some point, Kyowa apparently failed an FDA inspection and AL Pharma switched to \nAjinomoto for the AL Pharma product.  (Tr. 307:7\u201316).  When that happened is not clear \nfrom the record.  But neither the Sandoz product nor the AL Pharma product used the cysteine supplied by Nippon Protein for the ANDA Product. 27 129. The glass vial used as a cont ainer also differs between the Sandoz product and the \nANDA product.  (DTX -166 (\u201cthe glass vial sources are different for Allergy Labs and GRAM\u201d) , \nJTX-14.197\u2013198, JTX -14.10387, Tr. 369:5\u2013370:21).  As evidenced by Exela\u2019s development of \nELCYS, the vial can i mpact how much aluminum is leached and thus the aluminum content of the \nproduct .  (Tr. 146:23\u2013147:6, 358:1\u20139, 584:24\u2013585:5; PTX -1.1656\u2013.1663, supra, \u00b6  52).   \n130. Finally, there is a differen ce between the Sandoz product and the ANDA product \nin terms of the aluminum content over time.  There was no evidence that any Sandoz product met \nthe claimed l imitation requiring less than 150 ppb (mcg) over a 12 month or more time period.  \n(Tr. 472:14\u201318, 506:7\u201321, 577:9\u201314).   Eton has stipulated that its product meets that limitation. \n(D.I.  199).  \n*     *     * \n131. The ANDA product and the Sandoz product are made by different manufacturing \ntechniques, use different vials , and source their active pharmaceutical ingredients from different \nsuppliers. \n132. Not only are the individual differences between the Sandoz product and the ANDA \nsignificant, but they also have the capacity to interact and affect the product in unpredictable ways.  \nAs Dr. Jenke explained, \u201cthe impact or the mechanism by which time and temperature influe nces \nleaching is different than the mechanism by which the solution impacts leaching, but the combined effect, the effect that dictates how much aluminum is actually in the product is caused by the interacting phenomenon of both the solution and time and t emperature.\u201d  (Tr. 586:7\u201321).   \n133. The ANDA product is not the same as the Sandoz product . 28 b. Eton Has No t Proven that Any Prior Art Sandoz Product Had \nAluminum Below 150 ppb at Three Months   \n134. The parties agreed that the Sandoz product met all but the following l imitations  of \nclaim 27 of the \u2019155 patent : (1) stable L -cysteine composition, (2) per liter of L -cysteine \ncomposition, not more than 150 mcg of aluminum, (3) cystine not more than about 2.0 wt % , and \n(4) pyruvic acid not more than about 2.0 wt % .  (Tr. 452:13\u201318, 456:20\u2013457:7, 467:1\u201317). \n135. The \u201cstable\u201d limitation requires that the product \u201ccontain the specified levels of all \ncomponents for sufficient period of time to enable the composition to be commercially \nmanufactured, stored, shipped, and administered in a clinical setting.\u201d  The \u201cspecified levels\u201d are \ndescribed in the claim limitations ( e.g., not more than 150 ppb of aluminum) and the \u201csufficient \nperiod of time\u201d is  three months.  ( See infra \u00a7 III.A (Claim Construction) ). \n136. Of the certificates of analysis i n evidence  (DTX- 123, DTX -124, DTX -125, DTX-\n486, PTX -194 (summary), PTX -195 ( summary )), only one, DTX -486 (\u201cthe Sandoz Canada \ncertificate\u201d), suggests a product that contained less than 150 ppb aluminum at the three -month \nmark.10  The Sandoz Canada certificate shows a level of 150 ppb aluminum at seven months from \nthe manufacturing date and reports that Sandoz Canada Inc. manufactured the tested product. \n137. The Sandoz Canada certificate is not itself prior art.  (D.I. 212 at 3 (Eton explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he documents describing the Sandoz product, such as the Certificates of Analyses and \n \n10  In its papers, Eton expressed uncertainty about whether claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent requires \naluminum at or below 150 ppb for a full three months from the date of manufacture, and Eton offered three certificates of analysis (DTX -123, 124, 125) that show aluminum below \n150 ppb at one month from the date of manufacture.  ( See D.I. 212 at 16).  The Court\u2019s \nconstruction, however, requires that the composition maintain the specified levels for at least three months.  Eton does not argue that the aluminum levels at one month from the date of manufacture are indicative of the alumin um levels in those products two months \nlater.  29 Sandoz New Drug Application [] filing, are not themselves the prior art reference, but merely \ndescribe the product itself that was publicly sold from 2003 through 2016.\u201d)). \n138. Eton offered no evidence that the lot tested in the Sandoz Canada certificate was \never sold, offered for sale, imported, in public use or otherwise available to the public  in the United \nStates (or elsewhere) .11  No testimonial or documentary evidence supports that the lot tested in the \nSandoz Canada certificate was ever in the prior art.  \n3. Obviousness of All Claims Based on the Prior Art Sandoz Product in \nView of the Knowledge of a P OSA   \n139. Eton asserts that each of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent, claims 8, 9, and 10 of the \u2019713 \npatent , and claims 1, 19, and 27 of the \u2019795 patent are obvious  in light of the combination of the \nSandoz product with the knowledge of one of skill in the art  regarding leaching of aluminum and \ncoated vials .   \n140. Each of the asserted claims requires an L -cysteine solution or composition in which \nthe amount of aluminum is not more than 150 ppb12 for a period of time ( e.g., 3 months, 12 months, \n24 months). \n \n11  Although Dr. Hofstetter testified that Allergy Labs only prepared commercial batches for Sandoz (Tr. 300:22\u2013301:3), the Sandoz Canada certificate was for a batch not \nmanufactured by Allergy Labs.  Moreover, the Court cannot extrapolate from one \nCertificate of Analysis that there must have been at least one commercial batch that met \nthe limitation.  As Dr.  Baertschi agreed, the aluminum levels in the Sandoz p roduct \u201cvaried \nquite a bit.\u201d (Tr. 506:10\u201313).  And, as already noted, of the c ertificates of analysis marked \nas exhibits or summarized only one met the claim limitation.  In general, the Sandoz Canada certificates of analysis showed that \u201cthere was variability in the assay results\u201d for aluminum.  ( Tr. 677:6\u2013678:1). \n \n12  The asserted claims of the \u2019713 and \u2019795 patents refer to the solution having \u201cno more than\u201d or \u201cless than\u201d 150 ppb of aluminum.  (JTX -4 at cl. 8, 9, 10; JTX -5 at cl. 1, 19, 27).  \nClaim 27 of the \u2019155 patent includes a composition containing \u201cnot more than 150 mcg of Aluminum\u201d  in a liter.   (JTX -2 at cl. 27). 30 141. Each of the asserted claims requires an L -cysteine solution or composition with a \nlimited amount of impurities or precipitates.13 \na. The Sandoz Product  \n142. As discussed in section I.H.2.a , supra, the Sandoz product is not the same as the \nANDA product.  The  differences in the source of the ingredients, manufacturing process and \ncontainer  render  it inappropriate to use the ANDA product to determine the amounts of aluminum \nand other impurities (such as cystine and pyruvic acid) in the Sandoz product over time.  \n143. The evidence about the properties of the Sandoz product  consists of three Allergy \nLabs certificates of analysis .  (DTX -123, DTX-124, DTX- 125).  Dr. Hofstetter testified that \nAllergy Labs only prepared commercial batches for Sandoz .  (Tr. 300:22\u2013301:3).  The certificates \nof analysis for three of those batches indicate that the Sandoz product had less than 150 ppb \naluminum afte r 1 month but exceeded 150 ppb at the 24 -month mark.  The certificates indicate \nthat the product contained less than 2% impurities at both the 1- month and 24- month mark, but do \nnot indicate whether the product contained any mercury or lead.  (Tr. 573:9\u201314). \n144. The Sandoz product was stored in a 50 mL 20mm Clear Glass Vial, but the record \ndoes not identify anything else about the vial, including its supplier.  (DTX-54.026).   \n \n13  Claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent claims a method of administering a composition that has \n\u201ccystine relative to L -cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt %; and, pyruvic acid relative to \nL-cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt %.\u201d  (JTX -2 at cl. 27).  The asserted claims of the \n\u2019795 patent require that the solution be \u201csubstantially free of visually d etectable particulate \nmatter, at a pH from about 1.0 to 2.5\u201d for either 12 months (claim 1) or 24 months (claims 19 and 27) .  (JTX -5 at cl. 1, 19, 27).  The asserted claims of the \u2019713 patent all require \u201ca \npharmaceutically acceptable amount of cystine for  at least about 12 months from the time \nof manufacture of the solution,\u201d asserted claim 8  requires \u201clead in an amount from about \n1 ppb to about 10 ppb,\u201d asserted claim 9 requires \u201cmercury in an amount from about 0.2 ppb to about 5.0 ppb,\u201d and claim 10 requires both \u201clead in an amount from about 1 ppb to about 10 ppb\u201d and \u201cmercury in an amount from about 0.2 ppb to about 5.0 ppb.\u201d  (JTX -\n4 at cl. 8, 9, 10). 31 b. The Complex Nature of Aluminum Leaching  \n145. The asserted claims  cover a low -aluminum product with a limited amount of \nimpurities such as cystine and pyruvic acid.  The evidence shows that the levels of aluminum are \nnot independent of the amounts of impuri ties in  a cysteine product.   \n146. For example, when Exela reduced the aluminum levels in its cysteine product to \nvery low levels, its product failed .  One month into stability testing, the plastic -vial batches \nunexpectedly failed because the product contained visible particulate matter.  (JTX -13.11801, \nTr. 184:15\u201324).  \u201cExela analyzed the particulates and found that it [was]  L-Cystine, a [degradant \nand] result of oxidation of L- Cysteine.\u201d  (JTX -13.11801). \n147. Similarly, the experience of non- party Avadel Legacy Pharmaceuticals, LLC \n(\u201cAvadel\u201d) illustrates the relationship between aluminum le vels and impurities in a cysteine \nproduct. \n148. Avadel prepared six batches of its cysteine formulation that were identical except \nfor the vial used.  (Tr. 594:11\u2013595:5).  Half of the batches were contained in Schott Type I Plus \nvials, which are lined, and the other half were contained in normal Type I vials, which are unlined.  \n(Tr. 597:6\u2013598:5). \n149. Avadel manufactured these batches using certain oxygen controls (nitrogen overlay \nand headspace flush) but omitting other oxygen control steps (nitrogen sparging).  (Tr. 601:7\u201324, 602:13\u201315).  Avadel did not employ nitrogen sparging because it believed \u201cthe difference in \ncystine levels between bench -scale batches made using sparged vs. non- sparged WFI were \ninsignificant.\u201d  (PTX-1.1657, Tr. 601:7\u2013602:7). \n150. The use of different vials affected the aluminum levels in each vial.  The lined \nSchott Type I Plus vials showed aluminum at less than 5 ppb through 24 months, and aluminum 32 levels in the unlined Type I vials measured from about 45 ppb at  manufacture and 102 ppb at 3 \nmonths, up to 221 ppb at 12 months.  (PTX-1.1505-07, 1661, 1640). \n151. The lined vials (with extremely low levels of aluminum) unexpectedly generated \nprecipitates that Avadel later determined to be cystine precipitates, resulting i n product failure.  \n(PTX -1.1664, 1683).   \n152. That the same formulation was stored in two different containers, with only the \nlow-aluminum solution experiencing notable precipitation, is evidence that aluminum acts as a \nstabilizing force on cysteine in the presence of oxygen. \n153. Avadel responded to this observation by adding two nitrogen sparging steps that it \nhad believed were unnecessary.  (PTX -1.1640, 1675).  This step improved the stability of the \nproduct.  (PTX-1.1675, 1657, Tr. 600:8\u2013602:22). \n154. Avadel\u2019s experi ence led it to comment that \u201cthe apparent kinetics and equilibrium \nchemistry of the various cysteine and cystine species is complicated and not always predictable in \na practical setting.\u201d  (PTX -1.1674\u20131675). \nc. The Prior Art Did Not Teach How To Reduce Alumin um in a \nCysteine Product   \n155. The prior art did not provide a pathway to lowering the amount of aluminum in the \nSandoz product. \n156. Eton asserts that Hernandez- Sanchez\u2019s teaching that parenteral products \u201cshould be \nstored in containers that do not interact physically or chemically with the preparations\u201d would lead one of skill in the art to the Schott Type I Plus vial.  (D.I. 212 at 25 (citing PTX -152.2)).  \nHernandez- Sanchez, however, merely identifies the problem and does not offer a solution.  Indeed, \nthe 2013 re view paper states that \u201cAluminium (Al) toxicity problem in parenteral nutrition \nsolutions (PNS) is decades old and is still unresolved.\u201d  (PTX-152.1). 33 157. Hernandez- Sanchez teaches away from storing TPN products in glass vials , \nexplaining that \u201crepackaging CaG luc from glass containers to polyethylene vials reduces the mean \nAl concentration from 5000 to 195 mg/l (a 96% decrease).\u201d  (PTX-152.2). \n158. Eton suggests the Hernandez -Sanchez paper would lead a POSA to coated glass \nvials disclosed by the \u2019337 patent.  As des cribed  supra in  \u00b6\u00b6 106 to  110, the problem addressed in \nthe \u2019337 patent is materially different than the problem facing one trying to make a low -aluminum \ncysteine product that is low in particulate matter because lysine has a low affinity for aluminum \nand a markedly different pH value than cysteine.  Therefore, an artisan would not have a reasonable expectation of success in  developing a low -aluminum L -cysteine product based on what the \n\u2019337 patent discloses.  \n159. Although the Schott Type I Plus vial brochure advertises itself as being ideal for \nlimiting aluminum leaching, it contains no information specific to cysteine formulations.  (See JTX -13.11804\u201311811).  \n160. The Schott Type I Plus vial was on the market for more than a decade before Exela\u2019s \ninvention, during which time practitioners and the FDA were focusing on the aluminum problem in TPN products.  ( Supra \u00b6 54, infra \u00b6\u00b6 168\u2013174).  \n161. Aluminum leaching was a persistent problem in TPN products and the prior art did \nnot provide a roadmap to Exela\u2019s invention. \n4. Objective Indicia of Non -Obviousness  \n162. Aluminum toxicity ha d been known to be a problem with TPN compositions since \nthe 1980s.  (Tr. 82:10\u201314).  Side effects of aluminum toxicity include neurotoxicity, changes in \nneurodevelopment over time, or weakening of bones.  (Tr. 80:18\u201381:15). 34 163. In 1985, Sedman and co- authors published Evidence of Aluminum Loading in \nInfants Receiving Intravenous Therapy  in the New England Journal of Medicine, addressing \naluminum exposure in infants receiving parenteral therapy  and demonstrating that aluminum \nloading in neonatal TPM patients was occurring.  (PTX -190).   \n164. Sedman\u2019s article led the FDA to hold a workshop on aluminum in TPN products in \n1986.  (PTX -171, Tr. 84:23\u201385:7).  The workshop recognized the need to solve the aluminum \nproblem in TPN products and, in the interim, to disclose aluminum content on labels.  (Tr. 85:24\u2013\n86:11). \n165. In 1989, Klein and co -authors publi shed Hypocalcemia Complicating \nDeferoxamine Therapy in an Infant with Pare nteral Nutrition -Associated Aluminum Overload: \nEvidence for a Role of Aluminum in the Bone Disease of Infants in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.  (PTX -162).  Klein reported on an eight -month old infant \nreceiving TPN who had demonstrated osteopenic bone disease ( i.e., poor formation of the bone) \nand reported unsuccessful attempts to treat the patient.  (PTX -162.1, Tr. 87:6\u201388:5).\n14  Klein taught \nthat once aluminum deposition occurred, there was not much that could be done about it, so the focus on the field should be prevention.  ( Tr. 88:10\u201314) .   \n166. In 1997, Bishop an d others  published their study of the effects of high -aluminum \nTPN solutions on mental development  in premature infants  in the article Aluminum Neurotoxicity \nin Pret erm Infants Receiving Intravenous -Feeding Solutions  appearing in the New England \nJournal of Medicine.  (PTX -181.1, Tr. 89:4\u201390:2).  Bishop compared infants with a daily \naluminum exposure of 45 m cg/kg per day ( the standard, high- aluminum TPN solution)  with those \n \n14  The osteopenia observed by Klein was consistent with the bone disorder Dr. Kuhn \nobserved in his own neonatal unit at a UK Hospital.  (Tr. 88:6- 9).   35 exposed to 4 to 5 mcg/kg per day  using an aluminum -depleted TPN solution.  (PTX -181.2,  \nTr. 90:15\u201322).  Bishop observed that patients receiving the standard, high- aluminum TPN solution \nscored ten points lower on the Bayley Score of Infa nt Development (a 100 point scale that is often \nused to assess how well a child is moving along with milestones of neurological function) than \nthose receiving the aluminum -depleted TPN solutions.  (PTX -181.3, Tr. 89:4\u201390:14, 90:23\u2013\n91:13) .  In addition, Bis hop observed a two- fold difference in the percentage of patients scoring \nbelow an 85 on the Bayley Score (a score associated with significant mental delay) between those receiving the standard, high- aluminum TPN solution and those receiving the aluminum -depleted \nTPN solution (38% v. 17%).  (PTX -181.3, Tr. 90:23\u201391:13) .   \n167. Bishop concluded that the Bayley Score of the children receiving the standard, \nhigh- aluminum TPN solution went down one point for every day of exposure.  (PTX -181.5,  \nTr. 91:14\u201392:12) .   \n168. In 2000, the FDA promulgated a rule titled \u201cAluminum in Large and Small Volume \nParenterals Used in Total Parenteral Nutrition ,\u201d\n15 which required the maximum aluminum level at \nthe expiration or end of shelf life to be stated on the container for small volume parenterals.  (PTX -\n243, Tr. 93:12\u201320, 94:9 \u201395:5).  This FDA rule also required labels for small and large volume \nparenterals to include warning language that the product contains aluminum that can be toxic, and \nthat a daily aluminum exposure of 4 to 5 mcg/kg  per day can lead to aluminum accumulation \nassociated with neurotoxicity and bone toxicity.  (PTX -243.2- 3, Tr. 95:6\u201315, 96:25\u201397:8).  Th e \nFDA rule was implemented in July 2004.  (Tr. 96:14\u201317).   \n \n15  Cysteine products for TPN are small volume parenterals.  (Tr. 93:22\u201394:5). 36 169. Dr. Kuhn testified that, at the time of the FDA rul e\u2019s implementation, he was unable \nto meet the daily exposure targe t because the aluminum content of all of the ingredients added \ntogether was much higher than 5 m cg/kg.  ( Tr. 96:25\u201397:8). \n170. In 2005, Driscoll et. al.  published commentary in the American Journ al of Health -\nSystem Pharmacy , titled Calculating aluminum content in total parenteral nutrition admixtures , \nwhich calculat ed aluminum exposure from a number of simulated TPN solutions for an adult and \nfor an infant based on the labeling requirements from the FDA regulation.  (PTX -189.1, Tr. 97:10\u2013\n98:7) .  Driscoll identified cysteine hydrochloride as one of the three biggest sour ces of aluminum \nin TPN solutions.  (PTX -189.1, Tr. 98:8\u201317) .  Driscoll concluded that limiting the aluminum \nexposure for TPN patients to less than 5 m cg/kg per  day would not be possible for most patient s.  \n(PTX -189.3- .4, Tr. 98:18 \u201399:5).   \n171. In 2008, Poole e t al. published Aluminum Exposure From Pediatric Parenteral \nNutrition: Meeting the New FDA Regulation in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.  \n(PTX -156).  Poole calculated the aluminum exposure from one hundred TPN solutions \nadministered to the ir pediatric patients based on the labeled aluminum levels.  (PTX -156.2, \nTr. 99:6\u2013100:8).  Poole found that, for babies, every TPN solution exceeded the 4\u20135 m cg/kg per \nday target set by the FDA.  (PTX -156.3; Tr. 100:9\u201325).  \n172. As already noted, i n 2013, Hernandez -Sanchez (supra  \u00b6 100), stated that aluminum \ntoxicity in TPN solutions \u201chas been a problem for decades and is still unresolved\u201d (PTX -152.1)  \nand concluded that it was virtually impossible to comply with the FDA\u2019s g uidance of less than \n5 mcg/kg per day of aluminum exposure.  (PTX -152.7).  Hernandez -Sanchez identified cysteine \nhydrochloride as one of the major contributors of aluminum.  (PTX -152.1- 2, Tr. 102:10\u201319).  37 173. In 2016, Lima -Rogel published Aluminum Contamination in Parenteral Nutrition \nAdmixtures for Low -Birth -Weight Preterm Infants in Mexico in  the Journal of Parenteral and \nEnteral Nutrition.   (PTX -153).  Lima -Rogel stated that \u201c[a]luminum contamination from \nintravenous solutions still represents an unsolved cli nical and biochemical problem.\u201d  (PTX -\n153.1). \n174. The Sandoz product was sold from 2003 to 2016, during which time contemporary \npublications noted the still unresolved problem with aluminum levels in TPN compositions.  \n(Tr. 293:13\u201324, 378:3\u20139, 301:1\u20133, PTX -152). \n175. Moreover, a s noted above ( supra \u00b6\u00b6 89, 90), in 2016, Sandoz s ought (but did not \nobtain) FDA approval for a cysteine product by filing an ANDA  and then in May 2019, reached \nout to Exela seeking a license to market an L -cysteine  product.  (Tr. 200:18 \u2013202:11, Tr. 508:5- 13, \nPTX -490).  \n176. Before Exela received approval for E LCYS in April 2019, no FDA -approved \ncysteine product had been on the market since 2005.16   \n177. To date, the only FDA -approved cysteine products are ELCYS and Avadel\u2019s \nproduct (which is now owned by a third- party ).17 \n178. ELCYS is an embodiment of all asserted claims.   (See supra \u00b6\u00b6 36- 41).  And the \nAvadel product has been granted a license under the patents at issue in this case.  (Tr. 230:17- 21).  \n179. Dr. Kuhn testified that he uses EL CYS every day in the TPN solutions compounded \nin his pharmacy, and now his patients who receive TPN solutions meet the FDA daily aluminum \n \n16  The company that had that approval was Hospira, which had obtained approval in the \n1980s.  ( Tr. 159:12\u201321, PTX -308.8) . \n \n17  Avadel received approval for a low -aluminum cysteine product after the FDA approved \nELCYS.  (Tr. 594:4\u2013595:16, 230:3\u201312). 38 guidance.  ( Tr. 110:7- 9, 113:10\u201313).  The introduction of ELCYS also allowed Dr. Kuhn to use \ncysteine in the TPN solutions of older pediatric patients who previously would not have received \ncysteine, which in turn allowed those patients to receive increased amounts of calcium and phosphorus.  ( Tr. 110:22\u2013111:8). \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Claim Construction \n\u201c[T]he ultimate question of the proper construction of the patent [is] a question of law,\u201d  \nalthough subsidiary fact -finding is sometimes necessary.  Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n135 S. Ct. 831, 837- 38 (2015).  \u201c[T]he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and \ncustomary meaning [which is] the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e. , as of the effective filing date of the patent \napplication.\u201d  Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312- 13 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  Although \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms,\u201d the context of the surrounding words of the claim als o must be considered.  Id.  at 1314.  \u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning \nto the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.\u201d  Id. at 1321 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \nThe patent specification \u201cis always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . . . \n[as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d  Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , \nInc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  It is also possible that \u201cthe specification may reveal a \nspecial definit ion given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would \notherwise possess.  In such cases, the inventor\u2019s lexicography governs.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d at \n1316.  \u201cEven when the specification describes only a single embodiment, [howeve r,] the claims of 39 the patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to \nlimit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\u201d  Hill- Rom \nServs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Liebel -Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \nIn addition to the specification, a court \u201cshould also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution \nhistory, if it is in  evidence.\u201d  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 980 (Fed. Cir. \n1995) (en banc), aff\u2019d, 517 U.S. 370 (1996).  The prosecution history, which is \u201cintrinsic evidence, . . . consists of the complete record of the proceedings before the PTO [Pa tent and Trademark \nOffice] and includes the prior art cited during the examination of the patent.\u201d  Phillips , 415 F.3d \nat 1317. \u201c[T]he prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the i nvention and whether the inventor limited the \ninvention in the course of prosecution, making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.\u201d  Id . \nIn some cases, courts \u201cwill need to look beyond the patent\u2019s intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic  evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\u201d  Teva , 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \u201cconsists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecuti on history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.\u201d  Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980.  Expert testimony can be useful \u201cto ensure that the court\u2019s understanding of the technical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of  a person of skill in the art, or to establish that a \nparticular term in the patent or the prior art has a particular meaning in the pertinent field.\u201d  \nPhillips , 415 F.3d at 1318.  Nonetheless, courts must not lose sight of the fact that \u201cexpert reports \nand testimony [are] generated at the time of and for the purpose of litigation and thus can suffer 40 from bias that is not present in intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id .  Overall, although extrinsic evidence \u201cmay \nbe useful to the court,\u201d it is \u201cless reliable\u201d than intrinsic evidence, and its consideration \u201cis unlikely \nto result in a reliable interpretation of patent claim scope unless considered in the context of the intrinsic evidence.\u201d  Id. at 1318- 19.  Where the intrinsic record unambiguously describes the scope \nof th e patented invention, reliance on any extrinsic evidence is improper.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. \nv. Hewlett -Packard Co., 182 F.3d 1298, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Vitronics , 90 F.3d at 1583). \nB. Infringement  \nA patent is infringed when a person \u201cwithout authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells \nany patented invention, within the United States . . . during the term of the patent.\u201d  35 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 271(a). Courts employ a two- step analysis in making an infringement determination.  See \nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 976.  First, a court must construe the asserted claims.   See id.   Next, the trier \nof fact must compare the properly- construed claims to the accused infringing product.  See id.   \nLiteral infringement occurs where \u201cevery limitation in a patent claim is found in an accused product, exactly.\u201d  Southwall Techs., Inc. v. Cardinal JG Co., 54 F .3d 1570, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  \nIn an infringement action brought pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A) \u2013 the statutory \nprovision under which Plaintiffs have sued D efendant here \u2013 the infringement inquiry is \u201cwhether, \nif a particular drug were put on the market, it would infringe the relevant patent.\u201d  Acorda \nTherapeutics Inc. v. Mylan Pharm. Inc., 817 F.3d 755, 760 (Fed. Cir. 2016).   \nC. Validity  \nAn issued patent is presumed to be valid.  See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282.  To invalidate a patent, the \nparty seeking invalidation must carry its burden of proof by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d  See Procter & Gamb le Co. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 566 F.3d 989, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Clear \nand convincing evidence is evidence that \u201cproves in the mind of the trier of fact an abiding 41 conviction that the truth of [the] factual contentions [is] highly probable.\u201d  Intel Co rp. v. U.S. Int \u2019l \nTrade Comm \u2019n, 946 F.2d 821, 830 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted; first \nalteration in original).  \n1. Anticipation  \nAnticipation is a question of fact.  Microsoft Corp. v. Biscotti, Inc., 878 F.3d 1052, 1068 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017).  A patent claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found, either \nexpressly or inherently, in a single prior art reference.  See In re Gleave, 560 F.3d 1331, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Moba, B.V v. Diamond Automation, Inc., 325 F.3d 1306, 1321- 22 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \nThis test mirrors, to some extent, the test for infringement, and \u201c it is axiomatic that that which \nwould literally infringe if later anticipates if earlier. \u201d  Bristol -Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue \nLabs., Inc., 246 F.3d 1368, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In order to anticipate, however, a reference \nmust \u201c show all of the limitations of the claims arranged or combined in the same way as recited in \nthe claims. \u201d  Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc., 545 F.3d 1359, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008).   \nPursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a), a patent may be found invalid if \u201cthe invention was known \nor used by others in this country\u201d before the invention by the applicant.  \u201cIf the invention was known to or used by others in this count ry before the date of the patentee\u2019 s invention, the later \ninventor has not contributed to the store of knowledge, and has no entitlement to a patent.\u201d Woodland Tr. v. Flowertree Nursery, Inc., 148 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  \u201cFor prior art to \nantici pate because it has been \u2018used,\u2019 the use must be accessible to the public.\u201d  Minnesota Mining \n& Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc., 303 F.3d 1294, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech., Inc., 463 F.3d 1299, 1305- 06 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \u201cThe prior  knowledge and use by a single \nperson is sufficient.\u201d   Coffin v. Ogden, 85 U.S. 120, 124 (1873); see also Brush v. Condit , 132 U.S. \n39, 48 (1889). 42 Material not explicitly contained in a single prior art document may still be considered for \npurposes of anti cipation if that material is incorporated by reference into the document.  See \nUltradent Prods., Inc. v. Life -Like Cosmetics, Inc. , 127 F.3d 1065, 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1997). \nIncorporation by reference provides a method for integrating material from various doc uments into \na host document by citing such material in a manner making clear that the material is effectively \npart of the host document as if it were explicitly contained therein.  See Advanced Display Sys., \nInc. v. Kent State Univ., 212 F.3d 1272, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2000). \n2. Obviousness  \nA patent may not issue \u201cif the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art \nare such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains.\u201d   35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a).  Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying \nfactual findings concerning: (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the differences between the claims and the prior art; (3) the level of ordinary skill in the art, and (4) objective considerations \nof nonobviousness.  See Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17- 18 (1966).  To prove that a \npatent is obvious, a party must demonstrate \u201cthat a skilled artisan would have had reason to combine the teaching of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success from doing so.\u201d   In re \nCyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended -Release Capsule Patent Litig., 676 F.3d 1063, 1069 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Amgen, Inc. v. F. Hoffman- La Roche Ltd., 580 F.3d 1340, 1362 (Fed. \nCir. 2009) (\u201cAn obviousness determination requires that a skilled artisan would have perceived a reaso nable expectation of success in making the invention in light of the prior art.\u201d).  Although an \nanalysis of any teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine known elements is useful to an 43 obviousness analysis, the overall obviousness inquiry must be expansive and flexible.  See KSR \nInt\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398, 415, 419 (2007).   \nThe use of hindsight is not permitted when determining whether a claim would have been \nobvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.  See id.  at 421 (cautioning agains t \u201cthe distortion caused \nby hindsight bias \u201d and obviousness \u201c arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning\u201d ).  To protect \nagainst the improper use of hindsight when assessing obviousness, the Court is required to consider \nobjective (or \u201csecondary\u201d) considerations (or \u201c indicia \u201d) of non -obviousness, such as commercial \nsuccess, failure of others, unexpected results, and long- felt but unmet need.  See, e.g., Leo Pharm. \nProds., Ltd. v. Rea, 726 F.3d 1346, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Claim Construction  \nDuring the claim construction proceedings, the parties agreed to the following \nconstructions for terms in the asserted  claims : \n1. \u201csafe\u201d means \u201ca property of the compositions and methods relative \nto the art method and compositions and/or to FDA regulatory determination of the compositions and methods as part of a therapeutically or nutritionally effective regimen\u201d  (\u2019795 Patent, \nclaims 1, 19, 27) \n 2. \u201cwherein for at least 12 months from the time of manufacture of the solution, the solution will remain: substantially free of visually detectable matter, at a pH from about 1.0 to about 2.5, and containing no more than 150 ppb of aluminum\u201d needs no construction, and \u201cat least 12 months from the time of manufacture of the solution\u201d appli es to the recited limitations regarding visually \ndetectable matter, pH, and aluminum \u201d (\u2019795 Patent, claim 1)  \nAt the beginning of trial, the Court heard claim construction arguments on two disputed \nterms: (1) \u201cabout,\u201d in claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent, and (2) \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable amount of \ncystine,\u201d in claim 1 of the \u2019713 patent, from which asserted claims 8, 9, and 10 depend.  During \nthe course of trial, two additional claim construction dispute s emerged .  The first regarded  the term 44 \u201cstable L -cystei ne composition\u201d in claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent , for which the parties had twice \nprevious ly represented they agreed  upon a definition .  (D.I. 83, D.I. 179 -1 at 10).   The second \nregarded \u201cpyruvic acid relative to L -cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt  %\u201d also  in claim 27.   At \ntrial, the Court construed three of those terms as follows:  \n1. \u201cabout\u201d means \u201capproximately\u201d and is not indefinite, as Defendant \ncontends.  (\u2019155 patent , claim 27 ). \n 2. \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable amount of cystine\u201d has its plain and ordinary meaning, which is \u201can amount of cystine that is compatible chemically and/or toxicology with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and/or the mammal being treated therewith.\u201d  The term is not indefinite.   (\u2019713 patent, claims 8, 9, and 10).  \n 3. \u201cstable L -cysteine composition\u201d mean \u201can L -cysteine composition \nthat has the component profiles described herein, for example, Aluminum, L -Cystine, and pyruvic acid, at the levels described and \nfor the amount of time identified. In other words, a st able \ncomposition will contain the specified levels of all components for sufficient period of time to enable the composition to be commercially manufactured, stored, shipped, and administered in a clinical setting.  In general, products are considered stable if the period of time is three months, or three to six months, or three to 12 \nmonths, or three to 15 months, or three to 18 months or three to 24 months.\u201d\n18  (\u2019155 patent, claim 27). \n \nThe Court explained its reasoning for its constructions of the above terms at trial.  ( See Tr. 543:16\u2013\n548:24). \nAs to \u201cpyruvic acid relative to L -cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt  %\u201d in claim 27 of the \n\u2019155 patent, t he parties dispute whether this term requires the presence of pyruvic acid, or whether \nit can be met by the absence of pyruvic acid.  Plaintiff contends that this limitation \u201cset[s] only a \nceiling [] and not a floor [] on the amount of pyruvic acid the formulation may contain.\u201d   (D.I. 209 \nat 6).  Defendant argued at trial that this limitation requires the presen ce of at least some pyruvic \n \n18  This construction is the construction that the parties agreed to prior to trial.  ( D.I. 83 , \nD.I. 179- 1 at 10).   45 acid, otherwise the limitation would be superfluous  (Tr. 280:14\u2013281:20) , but Defendant did not \nadvance a claim construction position in its post- trial briefs.  \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff .  \u201c[P]yruvic acid relative to L -cysteine not more than about \n2.0 wt %\u201d does not require the presence of pyruvic acid in the formulation.  As an initial matter, \nthe plain and ordinary language of this term does not set a lower boundary for the amount of \npyruvic acid or indicate that it must be present.  In contrast, unasserted claim 28 of the \u2019155 patent requires \u201cpyruvic acid in an amount from about 0.001 wt % to about 2.0 wt % relative to L -\ncysteine.\u201d  (JTX -2 at 4:43\u201344).  This suggests that t he patentee knew how to set a lower bound on \nthe amount of pyruvic acid relative to L-cysteine, but chose not to do so in claim 27.    \nMoreover, t he specification offers further support  for the Court\u2019s construction, as it \ncontemplates compositions that may  contain no pyruvic acid.  At column 25, lines 51\u201355 of the \n\u2019155 patent, the specification states: \nAdvantageously, in certain embodiments, the compositions \nmaintain pyruvic acid levels for extended periods, and/or are substantially free or essentially free  of pyruvic acid.  When present , \npyruvic acid is typically present in a relatively small amount compared to L- cysteine.\u201d   \n \n(JTX -2 at 21:51\u201355) (emphasis added). \nFor the above reasons, the Court construes \u201cpyruvic acid relative to L -cysteine not more \nthan about 2.0 wt %\u201d to have its plain and ordinary meaning, which sets a limit to the amount of \npyruvic acid when present, but does not require the presence of pyruvic acid. \nB. Infringement  \nPrior to trial, the parties stipulated to infringe ment of all asserted claims of the \u2019713 and \n\u2019795 patent s, leaving only claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent contested.  (D.I. 199).  With respect to claim  \n27, the parties agreed that Eton\u2019s ANDA product meets all limitations except one: \u201cpyruvic acid 46 relative to L -cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt %.\u201d  (D.I. 201).  The parties agreed that if the \nCourt found that the ANDA product met this limitation, then Eton infringes claim 27 under \n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2), contributes to the infringement of claim 27 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c), and \ninduces infringement of claim 27 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b).  (D.I. 201 \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20134). \nDefendant\u2019s non- infringement position is that Exela did not prove that its product contains \nany pyruvic acid.  (D.I. 220 at 1-3, D.I. 212 at 28 (\u201cEton does not believe that any pyruvic acid \nexists in its proposed ANDA product\u201d)).  The Court , however, construed \u201cpyruvic ac id relative to \nL-cysteine not more than about 2.0 wt %\u201d to require only that the amount not exceed the maximum \nstated in the claim.  The claim does not set a minimum amount of pyruvic acid, and the claim as \nconstrued does not require that any pyruvic acid be present.   \n\u201cWhat a generic applicant asks for and receives approval to market, if within the scope of \na valid claim, is an infringement.\u201d  Sunovian Pharms ., Inc. v. Teva Pharm s. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Defendant s eeks to market an L -cysteine product that contains no more \nthan 2.0% impurities total.  ( Supra \u00b6 66).  Thus, the level of one of those impurities, pyruvic acid, \nmust be less than 2.0%.19  Because Eton\u2019s ANDA product contains less than 2.0% pyruvic acid \nrelative to L -cysteine, it meets the only disputed limitation of claim 27.  Th us, Exela has proven \nthat Eton directly infringes claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent, and based on the parties\u2019  stipulation  \n(D.I.  201), Eton  contributorily infringes and induces infringement of claim 27 as well . \nC. Validity  \nEton contends that claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent is anticipated by the Sandoz product and \nthat all asserted claims are obvious in view of the Sandoz  product and the knowledge of one of \n \n19  The product contains only L -cysteine, water , and a pH adjuster if necessary.  There was no \ndispute that the reference to 2.0% total impurities also means 2.0% relative to L -cysteine.  47 skill in the art regarding leaching and use of coated vials .20  The Court addresses each defense in \nturn. \n1. Anticipation  \nEton a sserts two bases on which claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent is anticipated by the Sandoz \nproduct :  (1) the Sandoz product is the same as the ANDA product and (2) the Sandoz product sold \ncommercially possessed all limitations of claim 27.  \na. Eton Has Not Proven that the Sandoz and ANDA Products Are \nthe Same   \nEton argues that the Sandoz product is the same as the ANDA product, and thus, if the \nANDA product infringes, the Sandoz product must anticipate because \u201c[t]hat which infringes, if \nlater, would anticipate, if earlier .\u201d  Peters v. Active Mfg. Co ., 129 U.S. 530, 537 (1889).  Eton \nsubmits that ingredi ents of the products are the same and the manufacturing process for the two \nproducts is similar, with the only difference being that the ANDA product has an additional step \nof terminal sterilization , which is immaterial.  (DTX -568.024\u2013025, 041\u201342, Tr. 304: 8\u201324, 305:15\u2013\n22, 623:16\u201321).  The evidence, however, points to differences between the two products, including differences that can impact the amount of aluminum, cystine , and pyruvic acid in the composition \nreferenced . \nFirst, it is apparent that the Sandoz product and Eton\u2019s ANDA Product are not the same, \nas they differ as to amount of aluminum over time.  ( Supra \u00b6 130).   Eton\u2019s expert Dr. Baertschi \nacknowledged that the Sandoz p roduct would not have met Eton\u2019s specifications for aluminum  \n \n20  In Eton\u2019s Responsive Post -Trial Brief concerning the parties\u2019 infringement dispute , Eton \nfor the first time argued that if the \u201cnot more than\u201d limitation in claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent \ncan mean zero, the patent claim is invalid.  (D.I. 220 at 3\u20134).  This argument was not presented at trial or in the pre -trial order and is therefore waiv ed.  See Allergan, Inc. v. Barr \nLabs., Inc., 808 F. Supp. 2d 715, 735 (D. Del. 2011) (refusing to address argument raised \nfor the first time in a post -trial brief).  48 over the shelf life  of its ANDA product .21  (Id.).  And there was no evidence that the Sandoz \nproduct maintain ed aluminum levels below 150 ppb for 3 months from manufacture, let alone 12, \n18, or 24 months.  ( Id.). \nMoreover, as Exela points out, t he added terminal sterilization step  involves heat .  The \nprior art taught that heat impacts the amount of leaching of aluminum as well as the degradation \nand impurity content of cysteine products.  (Supr a \u00b6\u00b6 96- 97, Tr. 305:19\u201322 ).  Specifically, higher \nheat increases the amount of leaching of these products \u201cdramatically.\u201d  ( Id.).  Moreover, the \nadditional sterilization step is not the only difference  in the manufacturing process .  Eton also \nadded oxygen controls that were not part of the process to make the Sandoz product.  ( Supr a \u00b6 124) .  \nAs Bohrer taught, the amount of oxygen present impacts aluminum leaching in a cysteine \nformulation, i.e., that leaching behavior persisted longer when oxygen was present than when it \nwas n ot.  (Supra \u00b6  98). \nThe differences are not limited to manufacturing.  T he Sandoz product use d a different vial  \nthan the ANDA product  and Eton offered no evidence that the change to the vial was not \nsubstantial.  ( Supra \u00b6  129) .  Although this may seem a minor adjustment, the evidence shows that \nthe vial used can affect how much aluminum is leached.  Indeed, this is evident  from the real-life \nexperience of companies in the field.  For example, non- party Avadel put the same formulation \ninto lined and unlined vials, with the result that the formulation i n the lined vials had low levels of \naluminum and later precipitates formed, but the unlined vial had a higher aluminum level and no \nproblem with precipitates.  ( Supra \u00b6\u00b6 148\u2013152).   Similarly, during Exela\u2019s development process it \nswitched from glass to plastic vials, which substantially lowered the aluminum levels but later \ncaused precipitates to form.  ( Supra \u00b6\u00b6 51\u201352).  \n \n21  Dr. Baertschi notably did not opine that the two products were the same.   49 Further, the two products are made with cysteine hydrochloride sourced from different \ncompanies .  (Supra \u00b6 126).  As Exela argues, this is meaningful because different suppliers sell \nproducts with different impurity profiles.  Again , the impact of this is evidenced by real world \nfacts.  Indeed, Exela lowered the amount of aluminum in its product in part by sourcing its active \npharmaceutical i ngredient from its supplier who offered the ingredient with a lower aluminum \nlevel than its previous source.  (Tr. 204:8\u201317, supra \u00b6 51).  And again, Eton offered no evidence \nas to the immateriality of the specific change.  \nEach of the differences between the two products has the potential to impact the end \nproduct with respect to aluminum content and impurities .  Moreover, the evidence demonstrates \nthat the factors in the process are interconnected, such that a change in one factor, like aluminum \nlevels, can alter another factor, like the level of cystine.  (Tr. 582:7\u201316).  Thus, the differences \nbetween the products preclude a finding that the Sandoz product is the s ame as the ANDA product.  \nAnd Defendan t has not proven anticipation by clear and convincing evidence on that ground. \nb. Eton Has Not Proven that the Sandoz Product Contains Each  \nand Every Element of Claim 27      \nAs noted above ( supra \u00b6 134), the parties agreed that the Sandoz product met all but four \nlimitations of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent: (1) stable L -cysteine composition, (2) per liter of L -\ncysteine composition, not more than 150 mcg of aluminum, (3) cystine not more than about 2.0 wt  %, and (4) pyruvic acid not more than about 2.0 wt %.   \nEton\u2019s asserted proof that the Sandoz product was a stable composition having not more \nthan 150 mcg of aluminum relies on a single certificate of analysis, the Sandoz Canada certificate, that reports an aluminum level of 150 ppb seven months after the date of manufacture.  (DTX -\n486).  Eton does not assert that the Sandoz Canada certificate is prior art, but  states that it describes \nthe Sandoz product that was in public use.  (D.I. 212 at 3 (\u201cThe documents describing the Sandoz 50 product, such as the Certificates of Analyses and Sandoz New Drug Application [] filing, are not \nthemselves the prior art reference, but merely describe the product itself that was publicly sold from 2003 through 2016.\u201d) , D.I. 211 \u00b6 9).  There is, however, insufficient evidence that the Sandoz \nCanada certificate describes a lot that was in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public in the United States (or elsewhere) .   \nEton argues that the certificates of analysis it submitted describe products that were on sale \nbecause Dr. Hofstetter testified that Allergy Labs only prepared commercial batches for Sandoz.  Even crediting that testimony, however, the Sandoz Canada certificate lists \u201cSandoz Canada Inc.\u201d \nas its manufacturer, not \u201cAllergy Labs.\u201d  (DTX- 486).  And although there is some evidence that \nlots that Sandoz Canada Inc. manufactured may have been on sale  or in public use or otherwise \navailable to the public  (supra \u00b6 88), there is no evidence as to the properties of the products in \nthose lots, let alone the properties of those lots as relevant to the specific limitations of claim 27 .  \n(Supra \u00b6 138).  Given the variability seen in terms of aluminum levels ( see supra \u00b6\u00b6 76- 78) and \nthe fact that only one of the many certificates of analysis reviewed met  the aluminum limit claimed, \nthe Court cannot conclude that any Sandoz product sold possessed all claimed limitations of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent.  Eton has thus failed to prove that claim 27 is anticipated by the Sandoz product. \n2. Obvious ness \nEton contends that all asserted claims are obvious in view of the Sandoz product and the \nknowledge of one of skill in the art.  (D.I. 212 at 29\u201337).  The obvious ness argument is generally 51 the same as to all claims .  The parties addressed the claims collect ively , and the Court will do so \nas well.22 \na. Eton Has Not Demonstrated That Putting the Sandoz Product \nIn a  Schott Type I Plus Vial Would Result in the Claimed \nInventions   \nEton \u2019s obviousness arguments are, like its anticipation arguments, based on the Sandoz \nproduct .  More specifically, Eton contends that the Sandoz product  contained all asserted claim \nlimitations other than those limiting the level of aluminum over the time specified in the claims (3, \n12, or 24 months)  and that it was obvious to use Schott T ype I Plus vials to reduce the aluminum \nto acceptable levels .  Even assuming Eton were correct as to the properties of the Sandoz product,  \nits argument fails to look at the invention \u201cas a whole, not separate pieces of the claim.\u201d  Siemens \nMed. Sols. USA, Inc. v. Saint -Gobain Ceramics & Plastics, Inc., 637 F.3d 1269, 1282 (Fed. Cir. \n2011) (quoting Sanofi- Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 550 F.3d 1075, 1086 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ).  Indeed, \nall of the asserted claims require not only a stable L -cysteine solution (or composition) containing \nno more than 150 ppb of aluminum, but also impose limits either on the amounts of certain \nimpurities or that the solution be subst antially free of visually detectable particulate matter.  \n(Supra \u00b6\u00b6 140\u2013141).    \nThe evidence at trial  showed that reduction of aluminum in a cysteine formulation is not \nwholly independent of  all the other properties and characteristics of the formulation, including \nacceptable levels of impurities, such as cystine.   Rather, the evidence indicated that varying the \namount of aluminum in a cysteine formulation can impact other aspects of the form ulation, \nincluding the amount of cystine and the appearance of precipitates .  And how that happens is \n \n22  This is tr ue with one exception.   Claims 8 -10 of the \u2019713 patent specify ranges for the \namounts of lead or mercury or both.  The additional arguments made regarding the \nobviousness of these claims are addressed separately.  52 complex and unpredictable.  Indeed, the complexity is illustrated in the real world experiences of \nExela and Avadel in developing their cysteine products.  During development, Exela lower ed the \naluminum levels to very low levels using oxygen controls and placed the product in plastic  vials.  \n(Supra \u00b6\u00b6 52\u201353).  Those batches , however, generated particulates  and failed .  (Id.).  Avadel faced \nsimilar challenges.  When Avadel put its L- cysteine product into Schott Type I Plus vials without \nsufficient oxygen controls, its product produced cystine precipitates and also failed .  (Supra \u00b6 151).  \nAvadel\u2019s diffi culties in development led it to comment on the \u201ccomplex\u201d chemistry of cysteine \nand how it is \u201cnot always predictable in a practical setting.\u201d  ( Supra \u00b6 158). \nThere is simply no evidence that combination of the Sandoz product in the Schott Type I \nPlus vial s would have achieved the claimed inventions.  Indeed, to the extent that the Sandoz \nproduct, like the Avadel product that failed, was made without oxygen controls, that suggests that the Sandoz product  in the Schott Type I Plus vial (as the Avadel product  was) would also have \nproduced unacceptable cystine precip itates  and taken it outside of the claimed inventions. \nb. Eton Has Failed To Show a Reason to Combine the Sandoz  \nProduct and the Schott Type I Plus Vial      \nEton has not shown that a POSA would have chosen the Schott Type I Plus vials to reduce \naluminum levels with cysteine products.  To the contrary, the evidence shows that a POSA  would \nnot have had a reason to put the Sandoz product in a Schott Type I Plus vial.  Indeed, Sandoz sold \nits product from 2003 to 2016.  ( Supra \u00b6 71).  The S chott Type I Plus vials had been available \nsince the early 2000s.  ( Supra \u00b6 54).  From 2003 to 2016, the problem of aluminum leaching was \nknown and remained unresolved.  (Supra \u00b6 174).  Yet it was apparently not obvious to Sandoz to \nput its product in Schott Type I Plus vials.  Moreover, \u201c [t]he elapsed time between the prior art \nand the [] patent\u2019s filing date evinces that the [] patent\u2019s claimed invention was not obvious to try.\u201d 53 Leo Pharms., 726 F.3d at 1356.  Such a \u201cconsiderable time lapse suggests instead\u201d that Eton \u201conly \ntraverses the obstacles to this inventive enterprise with a resort to hindsight.\u201d   Id.   \nIndeed, it is only through hindsight \u2013 knowing what Exela did and claimed and then looking \nat the prior art through that lens \u2013  that Eton argues obviousness .  For example, Eton a rgues that \nHernandez- Sanchez suggest s the use of a coated vial (D.I. 212 at 25), but  not even its expert, \nDr. Baertschi , connected any disclosure in Hernandez -Sanchez to coated vials, let alone the Schott \nType I Plus vial.  Hernandez- Sanchez recognizes the well -known problem of high aluminum in \nglass, but it provides no actionable solutions .  See Innogenetics, N.V. v. Abbott Labs., 512 F.3d \n1363, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (explaining that \u201cknowledge of a problem  and motivation to solve it \nare entirely different from motivation to combine particular references\u201d).  To the extent \nHernandez- Sanchez points to anything, it is to polyethylene (plastic) containers, not coated glass \nvials .23  (Supra \u00b6  104).  \nSimilarly, Eton points to the \u2019337 patent as motivating a POSA to put the Sandoz product \nin coated vials .  That patent, however, addressed a different aluminum problem (aluminum \nprecipitation) for a different pharmaceutical formulation (ibuprofen lysine) that had a much \ndifferent pH and a minimal ability to leach aluminum from glass.  (Supra \u00b6\u00b6 106\u2013110).  A POSA \nwould not have extrapolated the \u2019337 patent to cysteine formulations  particularly given the \ndifferences between cysteine and lysine noted by Bohrer 2001 in terms of affinity for aluminum.   \nSee Intendis GMBH v. Glenmark Pharms. Inc., USA , 822 F.3d 1355, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (finding \nno clear error with district court\u2019s determination that \u201cswapping ingredients in complex chemical formulations is anythi ng but \u2018routine.\u2019\u201d).  The \u2019337 patent teaches nothing about making or \nachieving the claimed inventions.  \n \n23  Exela tried plastic vials, but those le d to product failure .  (Supra \u00b6\u00b6  52\u201353).  54 Eton\u2019s hindsight- infected arguments fail  to make the proper obviousness analysis , which \n\u201crequires a form of amnesia that \u2018forgets\u2019 the invention and analyzes the prior art and \nunderstanding of the problem at the date of invention.\u201d   Mintz v. Dietz & Watson, Inc., 679 F.3d \n1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  \nc. Eton Has Failed to Show a Reasonable Expectation of Success  \nEton\u2019s arguments as to reasonable expectation of success  are similarly tainted  by hindsight.  \nIndeed, Eton\u2019s primary argument is that \u201cExela\u2019s own expressed \u2018expectation\u2019 that using the Schott \nType I Plus glass vial would resolve the leaching problem was \u2018 reasonable.\u2019\u201d  (D.I. 212 at 24) .  \nThe use, however, of the \u201cinventor\u2019s own path itself never leads to a conclusion of obviousness; \nthat is hindsight.\u201d  Millennium Pharm., Inc. v. Sandoz Inc ., 862 F.3d 1356, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2017) .24   \nRather, \u201c[w]hat matter s is the path that the [POSA] would have followed, as evidenced by the \npertinent prior art.\u201d   Id.  And here, Eton\u2019s arguments as to the path a POSA would follow are belied \nby reality, particularly in that no one (not even Sandoz) did it in the face of an undisputed strong \nmotivation to reduce aluminum in cysteine compositions.  This is especially notewo rthy against \nthe backdrop of Avadel\u2019s experience  and the fact that the ind ividual components of Eton\u2019s \nproffered solution were each known for years. \n \n24  That Exela\u2019s expert , Dr. Jenke, acknowledged that \u201ceverything [Exela] said in that letter \nwith respect to aluminum leaching is reasonable\u201d  (Tr. 667:10\u201313) does not change the \nresult.  Dr . Jenke also explained how the complexity of the art  shows a lack of reasonable \nexpectation of success.  He explained how the various factors impacting aluminum \nleaching set up a multi -dimensional and complex problem in the case of cysteine, including \nbecause both cysteine and cystine are strong aluminum leachers.  And he noted the \nexperience of Avadel as support as well.  55 d. Objective Indicia  \u2013 Long Felt Need  \ni. ELCYS Filled The Need for a Low -Aluminum Cysteine \nProduct That Had Exist ed For Decades   \nFor more than two decades before Exela\u2019s inventions, the clinical community widely \nrecognized that aluminum contamination of TPN components, including cysteine, was a long -\nstanding problem.  Numerous papers discussed the issue, expressly ch aracterizing the problem as \n\u201cdecades old and . . . still unresolved,\u201d and emphasizing the need for a solution.  (PTX -152.1).  \nEven the FDA stepped in to push companies to reduce aluminum content, implementing in 2004 \nregulations requiring labels to report the maximum aluminum content that had been observed in the product and to contain an aluminum toxicity warning not to exceed 4 -5 mcg/kg per day of \naluminum.  ( Supra \u00b6 168 ).  Relying on that art, and the fact that the only product available to him \n\u2013 the Sandoz product \u2013 was labeled  as containing up to 5,000 ppb aluminum, thereby precluding \ncompliance with FDA\u2019s recommended daily aluminum maximum, Dr. Kuhn explained that there was a long -felt need for a stable, low -aluminum cysteine product for TPN.  (Tr. 109:14\u201317).  \nDr. Jenke agreed based on his own review of all the art, and no Eton fact or expert witness disputed \nthe need.  (Tr. 672:10\u201315). \nELCYS filled that need.  ELCY S provided, for the first time, a stable, low -aluminum \ncysteine composition that allowed clinicians to administer TPN solutions without exceeding the FDA\u2019s recommended daily maximum aluminum amount.  Because ELCYS is an embodiment of \nthe Asserted Claims, a nexus is presumed.  Alcon Research, Ltd. v. Watson Labs., Inc., No. 15-\n1159- GMS, 2018 WL 1115090, at *25 (D. Del. Mar. 1, 2018).  A nexus is also clear as a factual \nmatter, given that the Asserted Claims provide just what the art was calling for  \u2013 a stable, low -\naluminum cysteine composition for use in TPN, including for up to two years after manufacture. 56 ii. The Sandoz Product Had Not Already Fulfilled the Need  \nEton  asserts that the Sandoz product has already met any need  because the Sandoz product \nhad far less aluminum than the label  stated .  Eton \u2019s argument, however, is based largely on attorney \nargument.  Indeed, the evidence  is to the contrary.  First, the fact that clinicians and researchers \nconsistently acknowledged and called for a solution to the problem of high aluminum in TPN \nsolutions over a period of many years during which the Sandoz product was on the market suggests that the Sandoz product was, in fact, part of the problem \u2013 not that it contained the solution. \nSecond, the Sandoz product w as not a stable, low -aluminum cysteine composition for use \nin TPN.  The label for the Sandoz product states that it had no more than 5,000 ppb of aluminum , \nwhich is more than twice the FDA limit, and it also contained  a warning that \u201c[t]his product \ncontains aluminum that may be toxic.\u201d  (DTX -514).  As Exela\u2019s  experts explained, it is important \nto calculate the potential aluminum exposure from the Sandoz p roduct by using the amount stated \non the label  because that is th e only information available to clinicians  and to assume a lower level \nwould be risky.\n25  (Tr. 105:13\u2013107:21).  The labeled amount is set based on the FDA\u2019s regulations, \nwhich require that label reflect the \u201chighest level\u201d of aluminum observed in specified  batches.  \nMoreover, even if the Court were to look to the certificates of analysis from Allergy Labs \nand Sandoz Canada, it is apparent that the Sandoz product did not fulfill the long- felt need.  T he \ncertificates of analysis show aluminum levels under 5,000 ppb, but the levels at the relevant times \nare still high, and still highly variable.  (PTX -194 (summary table)).  Many of the certificates show \nhigh levels of aluminum measured relatively early in the product\u2019s shelf life, for example, 580 ppb at 7 months, and there is no dispute that aluminum levels tend to rise over time.  ( Id., Tr. 14 8:25\u2013\n \n25  Eton offered no testimony from its expert on this issue.  Eton\u2019s expert did, however, agree \nthat it would be \u201crisky\u201d not to assume the  product contained the amount stated in the label.   \n(Tr. 505:21\u2013506:2). 57 149:7, 506:10\u201315, 624:3 \u201315).  With that much variability in aluminum levels, there would be no \nway, even taking all the certificates of analysis into account, for clinicians to know if they would \nbe administering a product with acceptably low aluminum levels at the time they used the product in a clinical setting, or a product with levels much closer to the labeled maximum amount.   \n(Tr. 505:21\u2013506:2). \ne. Avadel\u2019s Simultaneous Invention is of Little Persuasive Value \nEton asserts that a third -party, Avadel, simultaneously invented a stable L -cysteine product \nwith low -aluminum and little to no particulate matter.  Avadel\u2019s achievement, Eton contends, \ndemonstrates that the claimed invention is obvious.  The Court is not persuaded.   \nAs an initial matter, \u201ca single instance of simultaneous invention cannot alone support a \nfinding of obviousness[.]\u201d  Immunex Corp. v. Sandoz Inc., 395 F. Supp. 3d 366, 408 (D.N.J. 2019), aff'd, 964 F.3d 1049 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  Indeed, in Regents of Univ ersity of Cal ifornia  v. Broad \nInstitute, Inc., the Federal Circuit relied on strong evidence of the invention\u2019s novelty to discount \nevidence of six simultaneous inventions.  903 F.3d 1286, 1291, 1295 \u201396 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \nSimilarly, the Court finds that Avadel\u2019s experience, detailed above, demonstrates that the invention \nExela claimed was unexpected and complicated.  Therefore, it is of little weight that Avadel later achieved the same solution after much experimentation and effort. \nf. Post-Grant Proceedings  \nEton petitioned for post -grant review of the \u2019453 patent, to which the asserted patents claim \npriority, as well as post -grant review of the \u2019155 patent.  The Patent Trial and Appeal Board denied \ninstitution of post -grant review for both patents.  (PTX -226, PTX -231).  Eton contends that the \nBoard never evaluated the prior art Sandoz product in any meaningful way, and in fact erred in its 58 analysis of the Sandoz product.  (D.I. 212 at 35\u201337).  Exela claims that Eton misunderstands \nExela\u2019s trial examination based on the post- grant reviews.  \nThe Court has independently examined each of Eton\u2019s invalidity claims without reference \nto the post -grant review proceedings  and has found that Eton had not proven by clear and \nconvincing evidence that any asserted claim is invalid as being anticipated or obvious.  Therefore, \nthe Court need not scrutinize the Board\u2019s reasoning or the accuracy of its findings. \ng. Eton Has Not Proven the Asserted Claims Obvious \nAs e xplained, Eton has failed to meet its burden of proving (1) that its obviousness \ncombination \u2013 putting the Sandoz product in a Schott Type I Plus vial  \u2013 would have even yielded \nthe claimed inventions; (2) a reason to combine the Sandoz product with a Schott Type I Plus vial; and (3) a  POSA would have had a reasonable expectation of success in achieving the claimed \ninventions.  This applies to each patent -in-suit and, in particular, with respect to the specific \naluminum-over- time and cystine -over- time claim limitations of each asserted claim, which \nencompass period s of time sufficient for the product to be administered in a clinical setting (\u2019155 \npatent, claim 27), 12 months (\u2019713 patent, claims 8 -10, \u2019795 patent, claim 1), and 18 or 24 months \n(\u2019795 patent, claims 19 and 27).  \nFinally, the asserted claims of the \u2019713 patent require the cysteine product to contain \nspecified levels of mercury and/or lead.  Claim 8 requires 1 -10 ppb of lead, claim 9 requires 0.2\u2013\n5.0 ppb of mercury, and claim 10 requires both 1-10 ppb of lead and 0.2- 5.0 ppb of mercury.  (JTX -\n4, 61:9\u201314).  T he only basis on which Eton argues obvious ness of these claims as to these \nlimitations is that lead and mercury must be present in the Sandoz product because it is the same \nas Eton\u2019s ANDA Produc t and , thus, Eton\u2019s stipulation to infringement means those limitations are \npresent in the Sandoz product.  The Court has already rejected that argument , and Dr. Baertschi 59 did not address the lead and mercury limitations .  Thus, for this additional reason, Eton failed to \nmeet its burden to show obviousness of claims 8- 10 of the \u2019713 patent by clear and convincing \nevidence.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAs explained above,  (1) the ANDA product infringes claims 8, 9, and 10 of the \u2019713 patent \nand claims 1, 19, and 27 of the \u2019795 patent; (2) Exela has proven that Defendant\u2019s ANDA product \ndirectly and contributorily infringes and induces infringement of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent; \n(3) Eton has failed to prove that claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent is invalid as anticipated; and (4) Eto n \nhas failed to prove that any of claim 27 of the \u2019155 patent, claims 8, 9, and 10 of the \u2019713 patent \nand claims 1, 19, and 27 of the \u2019795 patent is invalid for obviousness.   \nAn appropriate order will be entered.
