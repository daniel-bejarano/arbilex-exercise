The Court carefully revi ewed all submission s in connection with Defenda nt\u2019s motion , \nheard oral argument, and applied the relevant legal standards for review of this type of Section \n101-related motion at the pleading stage, which it has previously set out in Genedics, LLC v. \nMeta Co., Civil Action No. 17- 1062- CJB, 2018 WL 3991474, at *2- 5 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2018).   2 \n  The Court\u2019s Report  and Recommendation is consistent with the bench ruling announced \nat the hearing on July 8, 2022,1 pertinent excerpts of which follow:  \nWith that, let me move on to our first  ca[se], and the first case is \nWSOU Investments,  LLC  [d/b/a]  Brazos Licensing [&]  \nDevelopment [vs.] Netgear, Inc .  It[ is] Civil Action Number 21-\n1119- MN-CJB.    \n \nFor the reasons I will now state in this  matter, I recommend that \nNetgear \u2019s motion to  dismiss, w hich is pending before me, be \ndenied.  \n Here, the asserted relevant  patent -in-suit at issue is Plaintiff \u2019s \n[U.S.] Patent  Number 9,338,171, or the '171 patent.  The  patent is \ntitled \u201c Method and Apparatus for  Controlling Access to \nResources. \u201d \n At step one, the Court will treat claim 1  of the '171 patent, which is \na method claim, as  representative, as Defendant asserts that the \nclaim is representative of the remainder of the  asserted claims in \nthe patent.  \n Defendant argues that claim 1 is directed  to the abstract idea of \n\u201ccontrolling access to resources. \u201d \n Is \u201ccontrolling access to resources \u201d an abstract idea?  The [United \nStates Court of Appeals for the] Federal Circuit has  repeatedly \nfound that it is, such as in its  decision in Ericsson Inc. [vs.] TCL  \nCommunication Tech Holdings Limited,\n2 when the  Federal Circuit \nsaid as much.  \n The real dispute here at step one is  whether claim 1 is in fact \ndirected to this  abstract idea.  P laintiff argues that it[  is] not.  \nInstead, it argues that the claims are directed  to \u201cdistributed \nsystems and methods that  include wireless access points that \nfurther include an access control platform for security  \nauthentication that is based upon [ (i)] social networking group \ndesignation and [ (ii)] the limit of the number of users or  traffic \nload information to prevent  unauthorized access and performance  \n \n1  (See D.I. 83)  \n \n2  Ericsson Inc. v. TCL Commc\u2019n Tech Holdings Ltd., 955 F.3d 1317, 1326 (Fed. \nCir. 2020). \n 3 \n degradation.\u201d3  This is so, Plaintiff argues,  because \u201c [t]he claimed \nsystems and methods  reflect a patent -eligible improvement to  \ncomputer functionality, such as network security authentication \u201d \nand are not claims to  an abstract idea.4 \n \nThe \u201c directed to \u201d inquiry applies a  stage- one filter to claims, \nconsidered in light  of the  specification, based on whether \u201c\u2018 their \ncharacter as a whole \u2019\u201d or their \u201c focus \u201d is directed to excluded \nsubject matter.5  As to how  that inquiry should proceed, the \nFederal  Circuit provided some guidance in Internet  Patents Corp. \nv. Active Network, Inc.6  There,  in order to ascertain at step one \nwhether the  claims \u2019 \u201ccharacter as a whole\u201d  was directed to  an \nabstract idea, the Internet Patents  Court  examined the specification \nof the patent at  issue.7  In doing so, it cited to what the  patentee \nhad described in the specification as  \u201cthe innovation over the prior \nart\u201d and \u201cthe essential, \u2018most important aspect\u2019\u201d  of the  patent.8   \n \nHere, the parties don \u2019t spend a lot of  time in the briefing \nexplaining how, when one  looks to the content of claim 1 and the  \nspecification, one should determine what the  claim is directed to. \nNevertheless, the Court  will focus in some detail here on that  \nquestion.  On the one hand, as Defendant notes, the  title of the patent, which \nis \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Controlling Access to Resources,\u201d  \nhelps its argument.  That title makes it sound like the patent is \nfocused simply on the  general broad abstract idea posited by \nDefendant.  \n \n \n3  (D.I. 45 at 11)  \n \n4  (Id.) \n \n5  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1335- 36 (Fed. Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc. , 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2015)).   \n \n6  Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc., 790 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2015).   \n \n7   Id. at 1348.   \n \n8  Id. (citation omitted); see also Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial L.L.C., 818 F.3d \n1369, 1375- 76 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (assessing \u201cthe focus of the claimed advance over the prior art\u201d \nin the step one inquiry).   \n 4 \n Moreover, if one looked only at the  Background section of the \npatent, it might also  support Defendant \u2019s assertion.  In column [1], \nline 14 to 30[] of  that section, the patent  explains how service \nproviders want to provide  a service that allows for the sharing of  \nresources among users, such as allowing other  users to be able to \naccess a wireless access  point when the users are within the range \nof the ac cess point.  The section also notes how  \u201c[j]uxtaposed with \nthe ability to enable users to  share resources is the need to maintain  \nsecurity with respect to the resources . . . without  degradation of \nperformance of the resources. \u201d9  It notes that a user who shares a \nwireless  access point among designated users may wish to \nmaintain a certain level of both security and  performance of the \naccess point, but that the  uses of security features may make \n\u201csharing the  resources complex. \u201d10 \n \nPortions of column 4 of  the patent  expound on this problem.  In \ncolumn 4, lines 14 to 52, the patent explains that most providers  of \nwireless access points at the time used  password protection to \nprevent unauthorized people from connecting to an access point to \nthe internet or to other network resources  without permission; they \nalso used this method to prevent such persons from eavesdropping on their permitted users who were using the access  point.  But the \nspecification then notes how  the static, password -based secu rity \nprotocol  also created problems for service providers.  More \nparticularly, if the provider had given out passwords to all of its users, and if it  later decided that it wanted to block one of  those \nusers from access, a new password had to be created and  \ndistributed to other authorized users, or \u201c even more complex \nprocesses \u201d had to be used.\n11  This portion of column 4 also \ndescribed another problem that providers were  having in this \nsphere:  namely that if the  number of users associated with an \naccess poi nt got too large, there might be issues with \u201c degradation \nof services [.]\u201d12 \n This is all to say if you look only to the patent \u2019s title or to the \nportions of the  patent that cite the problem that the patent  sets out \nto solve , like the Background section  and these portions of column \n \n9  ('171 patent, col. 1:21- 24) \n \n10  (Id., col. 1:29- 30) \n \n11  (Id., col. 4:35)  \n \n12  (Id., col. 4:40- 41) 5 \n 4, then you might  conclude that claim 1 is simply directed to the  \nbroad concept of \u201c controlling access to  resources. \u201d   \n \nBut in the Court \u2019s view, there are more persuasive reasons to \nconclude that the claim  is not, in fact, directed to this general  \nprinciple, and instead is directed to something other than that.  For \nexample:  \n \nAs Plaintiff notes, large portions of  columns 4 through 8 are not \nsimply about  \u201ccontrolling access to resources \u201d generally.   Instead, \nthey describe a proposed solution to these problems:  a more \nspecific way of  controlling access to resources, namely doing so by \nutilizing social networking information  associated with the users, \nand also by utilizing performance characteristics  associated with  \nresources (and, in the context  of this patent, when I say \n\u201cresources, \u201d that can be understood to be a reference to wireless  \naccess points.)  For example, in column [4], line 53 to column 5, line 45, the patent  explains that \u201c [t]o address these problems,\u201d  the \nclaimed system and methods will control access  to resources \naccording to social connections  associated with the resource host \nand that  \u201c[d]epending on the social connections associated with \nother users and/or devices associated with  the othe r users as \ncompared to the host user of  the resources, the system 100 revokes \nor prevents access to the resources by the other  users and/or the \nother devices. \u201d\n13  It also  states that \u201c depending on one or more  \ncharacteristics associated with the one or more resources, such as, for example, a number of  users accessing the one or more \nresources, a  traffic load associated with the one or more  resources, \nor a combination thereof, the system  100 provokes or prevents \naccess to the resources by other users and/or the other  devices to \nmaintain a quality of service  provided by the one or more \nresources. \u201d\n14  And then, with regard to the social  networking \ninformation aspect of the solution, the specifi cation goes on to \nexplain that the  system introduces the capability to determine  \nwhether the user and the host are a part of a particular social networking group and to control access to resources based on \nwhether  one is a part of such a shared social  netw orking group.  \nAdditionally, other portions  of columns 5 through 8 go on to \nreiterate these aspects of the proposed solutions to the  above -\nreferenced problems, or to provide more  detailed possible \nimplementations of such  systems in order to control usage of \nwireless  access points.   So the point is that all those portions  of \n \n13  (Id., col. 4:53- 61) \n \n14  (Id., col. 4:61- 5:1) 6 \n patent that I just described aren \u2019t simply  speaking about \n\u201ccontrolling access to resources \u201d generally.  They \u2019re clearly \ntalking  about a particular way  to do so. \n \nClaim 1 itself, unsurprisingly, includes  lots of content about this \nparticular solution.  While the claim does start out by noting it [ is] \na method comprising the facilitating of the  processing of data \nand/or information and/or at  least one signal, and that it does so \nbased in  part on one or more resources (which can include one or \nmore wireless access points)  associated with at least one user or a \ncombination thereof , the claim also explains  that it does this in a \nparticular way.  That  is, the claim notes [] that it does so by \nprocessing social networking information associated with the user or device or both to determine one or more social networking groups  and by controlling access to the one or more  resources vis -\na-vis the user or device or both based, at least in part, on \nmembership in one  or more social networking groups and on \ncertain  characteristics associated with the resources,  which must \ninclude \u201c a number of users accessing the one or more wireless \naccess points, a  traffic load associated with the on e or more  \nwireless access points, or a combination thereof. \u201d\n15  Put differently \nmuch of the claim is  devoted not to claiming \u201c controlling access to  \nresources \u201d generally.  It[ is] about the more  particular way  that the \npatent says it is going to go about doing this.  \n There[ is] another reason why it doesn\u2019 t make sense for the Court \n[to] conclude that  claim 1 is directed simply to \u201c controlling access \nto resources. \u201d  The Court has noted that  [a] prior art way of \ncontrolling access to  wireless access points was to provide the \nsame password to various potential users.  That [ is] surely a way of \n\u201ccontrolling access to resources. \u201d  But no one would say the patent \nis directed to that  concept.  After all, the  patent disparages that \nconcept repeatedly, and  it takes pains to explain that the invention \nhere is a better solution than that  [to] the  problem of controlling \nsuch access.    \n In light of all this, the Court does not  agree with Defendant \u2019s \nargument that th e claim  is directed simply to the proposed abstract  \nidea.  It will thus recommend that the motion  can be denied on that \nground alone.  Nevertheless, for sake of completeness,  the Court \nwill also now address the motion at  step two.  In other words, the \nCourt will explain why, even assuming arguendo that it [is] wrong and claim 1 is  directed to the abstract  idea at issue, the claim \nshould nevertheless  survive the eligibility analysis at step [two].  \n \n15   (Id., col. 26: 10-14) 7 \n  \nAt step two, if a claim is directed to an  abstract idea, then the Alice  \nframework  requires the Court to assess \u201c what else is  there in the \nclaims \u201d by considering the  \u201celements of each claim both \nindividually and \u2018 as an ordered combination\u2019\u201d  in order to  \ndetermine whether the \u201cadditional elements  \u2018transform the nature \nof the claim \u2019 into a  patent -eligible application. \u201d16  The Supreme  \nCourt [of the United States] described step two in Alice  as the \nsearch  for an \u201cinventive concept.\u201d17 \n Although the Supreme Court used the term  \u201cinventive concept \u201d to \ndescribe what it is that helps the patentee survive step two, the search  for an inventive concept is not about whether  the claimed \nelement in question is new or  unique.\n18  Instead, an \u201cinventive \nconcept \u201d is simply \u201c an element or combination of elements  that is \nsufficient to ensure that the patent in  practice amounts to \nsignificantly more than a  patent upon the ineligible concept \nitself. \u201d19 \n As was noted in Amdocs (Israel) Limited  [vs.] Openet Telecom, \nInc.,\n20 a Federal Circuit  case, and Fitbit, Inc.  [vs.] AliphCom ,21 a \ncase from the [United States District Court for the] Northern District of California, in  the context of computer -focused claims, \nthe addition of an element that simply requires a  computer to work \nin its \u201c conventional \u201d manne r (for example, to speed up the \nprocessing of an abstract idea) can \u2019t amount to an inventive  \nconcept.  But the addition of elements that  amount to the \nunconventional use of technology might be enough.  \n \n16   Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l , 573 U.S. 208, 217 (2014) (certain internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). \n \n17   Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n \n18  See Affinity Labs. of Tex., LLC v. DIRECTV, LLC , 838 F.3d 1253, 1263 n.3 (Fed. \nCir. 2016).   \n \n19  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217- 18 (certain internal quotation marks, brackets and citations \nomitted).  \n \n20  Amdocs (Israel) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc., 841 F.3d 1288, 1306 (Fed. Cir. \n2016). \n \n21  Fitbit, Inc. v. AliphCom , 233 F. Supp. 3d 799, 812- 13 (N.D. Cal. 2017) . 8 \n Here at step two, even if [] claim 1  [were said to be directed to the] \nabstract idea of \u201c controlling access to resources, \u201d there would at \nleast be a factual  dispute, preventing grant of the motion, as to \nwhether the \u201csomething more \u201d in the claims \u2014that is, the method \u2019s \nuse of membership in a  social networking group and its use of  \nperformance characteristics like traffic load  and number of users to \ncontrol access \u2014amounts to an inventive concept.   \n \nIn that regard, Plaintiff argues that  claim 1 is a claim to a solution \nto a technical  problem:  \u201c an improved authentication scheme  that \nuses an association between the user [s] or  their device and social \nnetworking group information and limits based on the number of  \nuser[s and ] traffic loads. \u201d22  As the Court has  noted previously, \nthere is support for this  assertion in the record.  The patent explains  \nhow, in the past, there were problems  surrounding the giving of \naccess to wireless  access points, including those that cropped up \nvia the use of a traditional password- based  access system.  The \npatent asserts that the  claimed inventions and their utilization of  \nsocial networking information and performance  characteristics \nprovide a better way to permit  access to a wireless access point that \nsolved that technological problem.  The Court notes that there [ is] a dispute in the briefing, which was \namplified during argument today, about whether claim 1\u2019 s \n\u201ccontrolling of access \u201d step includes a  requirement that the claim \nutilizes an \u201c access  control platform \u201d in some way, and a dispute  \nabout what exactly that platform can do with  social networking \ninformation, such as whether, for example, it can keep or maintain files on  such information.  But at best for [D] efendant,  the question \nof whether the claim includes an  access control platform and/or \nwhat is the  extent of what that platform does would be a  claim \nconstruction dispute not well -suited to  be resolved today.  A t a \nminimum, it[  is] clear  the claimed method must process social  \nnetworking information and control access to the resource based on that information, and that alone would be [sufficient] for the Court to find a relevant factual dispute at step two.  \n In other words, there [ is] record support  for the idea that the \nclaimed solution can be  said to provide a more particularized way  \nof controlling access to resources that solves a technological \nproblem .  That [ is] sufficient for the Court to recommend denial of \nthe motion at  step two. \n \n \n22  (D.I. 45 at 17)  9 \n Additionally, the Supreme Court in Alice  noted that the concern \nthat drives Secti on 101\u2019 s exclusionary principle is \u201cone of  \npreemption[ ,]\u201d driven by the concern that patent  law not inhibit \nfuture discovery by improperly tying up the future use of building \nblocks and ingenuity.23  In that regard, surely claim 1 does  not \npreempt all ways of controlling access to resources, or anything \nclose to that.  The  patent already tells us about one prior art way to \ndo that that is not claimed:  the use of  manual passwords.  And it \nwould be hard to argue that there are no [t] myriad [] other ways to  \ndo so, other than by using membership in a  social media group and \nreliance on certain  limited types of performance characteristics.   \n \nThe Court recognizes that the [D]efendant  had a number of \narguments in opposition to [the Court\u2019s] conclusion.  I will address a few now.  \n Defendant, for example, argues that the  claim does not sufficiently \ndescribe how it  solves the problem of controlling access to wireless \naccess points.\n24  And here, the Court  acknowledges that there is \nsurely a level  of \u201chow\u201d that claim 1 does not provide.  More  \nspecifically, the claims don\u2019 t, for example, specify how  it is, from \na technological  perspective, that the method in question actually \nprocesses social networking  information or how  the method \nactually controls  access to the resources (beyond the fact that  it has \nto use a combination of characteristics  described in the claims to \ndo so).  And it may  well be that the specification also does not  \nprovide for much guidance in these regards  either.  \n \nThat said, as the Court noted previously, [the] claims do appear to \nmake use[] of specific steps  related to controlling access.  This  \nspecificity, in the Court \u2019s view, is sufficient  to survive step two. \n Moreover, in Visual Memory, LLC, v. NVIDIA Corp ., the Federal \nCircuit explained  that \u201c whether a patent specification teaches an  \nordinarily skilled artisan how to implement the  claimed invention \npresents an enablement issue under 35 U.S.C. [ \u00a7] 112, not an \neligibility  issue [] under [\u00a7]  101.[ \u201d]\n25  Here, Defendant \u2019s concerns \nabout lack of specificity sound more  like the subject of a Section \n112 challenge  than a viable Section  101 argument.   \n \n23   Alice , 573 U.S. at 216. \n \n24  (See D.I. 52 at 3- 4)   \n \n25   Visual  Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp., 867 F.3d 1253, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2017) . \n 10 \n  \nThe case law also supports the Court \u2019s decision in these regards.    \n For example, in CosmoKey Solutions GmbH  [&] Co. KG v. Duo \nSec[.] LLC ,\n26 a Federal Circuit  case cited by the [P]laintiff, the \nrepresentative claim at issue disclosed a method for  authenticating \nthe identity of a user to a  transaction at a computer.  In other \nwords, a  method of preventing hacking.  The Federal  Circuit \nconcluded at step two that the claim \u2019s limitations amounted to an \ninventive concept  that was something more than the abstract idea  \nat issue, which there was simply  \u201cauthentication [.]\u201d27  The \nCosmoKey  Court  disagreed  that the manner in which the claim \nperformed  authentication was \u201c far from concrete. \u201d28  Instead, the \nCourt explained that \u201c [h]ere, the claim limitations are more \nspecific and recite an improved method for overcoming hacking by \nensuring that the authentication function[] is  normally inactive, \nactivating only for a  transaction, communicating the activation  \nwithin a certain time window, and thereafter  ensuring that the \nauthentication function [i]s  automatically deactivated. \u201d29  In other \nwords, a s with the previously referenced aspects of claim  1 that are \nat issue here, these aspects of the CosmoKey  claim provided a \nsufficient  specificity to the method claim at issue there  to ensure \nthat the claim would not unduly monopolize the abstract idea at issue.  This  was so, even though the claim in CosmoKey  never  \nspecified how  the method transmitted a user  identification or how  it \nchecked the identification function (beyond using the one  criterion \nrequired by the claim) or how it ensured that the function was \nactivated or  inactivated at any step.  Moreover, in CosmoKey , the \nCourt was comforted in its  conclusion that this solution was an \ninventive  concept because the \u201c specification explains  that these \nfeatures in combination with the  other elements of the claim \nconstitute an  improvement that increase [s] computer and network \nsecurity, prevents a third party from  fraudulently identifying itself \nas the user,  and is easy to implement and can be carried out  even \nwith mobile devices [of] low complexity.\u201d\n30  Similarly here, the \n \n26  CosmoKey Sols. GmbH & Co. KG v. Duo Sec. LLC , 15 F.4th 1091 (Fed. Cir. \n2021) . \n \n27  Id. at 1095.  \n \n28  Id. at 1099 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n \n29  Id. \n \n30  Id.  11 \n specification of the '171 patent explains how the use of the social  \nnetworking information and performance  characteristics to control \naccess to wireless  access points also constitutes an improvement  to \ntechnology that enabled devices like these  to do things that they \nwere not previously able  to do. \n \nAnother helpful case for [P]laintiff is SRI  International, Inc. [vs.] \nCisco Systems,  Inc.,31 a Federal Circuit case that Plaintiff  says is \nmost similar to this one.  In SRI , the representative claim was to a \ncomputer -automated method of hierarchical event  monitoring and \nanalysis within a network.  The  claim did so by deploying network \nmonitors that  detected suspicious activity based on an analysis of \nat least one of certain categories  of network traffic data, then the \nmonitors  generated reports of suspicious activity, and then those \nreports were received and  integrated.  At step one, the SRI Court \nfound that the claim was not simply directed to the  abstract idea of \n\u201ccollect [ing] and analyz[ ing] data. \u201d32  Instead, the Court looked to \nthe patent  specification, which explained that the claimed  \ninvention solved weaknesses in conventional  networks in order to \nfix a technical problem  and provide a \u201c framework  for the \nrecognition of  more global threats to interdomain  connectivity, \nincluding coordinated attempts to infiltrate or destroy connectivity \nacross an  entire network enterpr ise.\u201d33  This was enough to assure \nthe Court that the computers used in the  claim were not added \nsimply \u201c as a tool \u201d to automate conventional activity.34  The SRI \nCourt  came to this conclusion even though the claim  did not \nspecify how  the network monitors  detected suspicious activity \n(beyond using at  least one of the categories of data mentioned  in \nthe claim) or how  they generated reports of  suspicious activity or \nhow they received and  integrated those reports.  As in SRI , here,  \nthere is a specific solution in the  representative claim to the \nproblem cited in  the patent, and the patent tells us that this  solution \npositively impacted others \u2019 ability to  use wireless access network \ntechnology, even if  the claim doesn \u2019t specify every detail  of how  \naccess is controlled.  \n \n \n31  SRI Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc ., 930 F.3d 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  \n \n32  Id. at 1304.  \n \n33  Id. at 1303- 04 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n \n34  Id. at 1304.  \n 12 \n In contrast, Defendant asserted that the Ericsson  case from the \nFederal Circuit was the  closest case to our facts, but in the Cour t\u2019s \nview, Ericsson  is distinguishable.  In Ericsson , the two \nrepresentative claims were to  a system for controlling access to a \nplatform  (or telecommunication system), and the Federal  Circuit \nsaid that those claims were directed to  the abstract idea of \n\u201ccontrolling access to, or  limiting permission to, resources. \u201d35  The \nCourt  also concluded that there was no inventive  concept found in \nthe claims.  The Ericsson  Court explained that the claimed \nelements,  essentially, were to an access controller that  controlled \naccess by receiving a request and  then determining that the request \nshould be  granted.  But the key in Ericsson  was that the \u201c claims \nare silent as to how access is  controlled.\u201d36  Indeed, the claims in \nEricsson  at issue never provided any  meaningful level of  detail, \nany real description of how [\u2014]as to what  specific factors were to \nbe utilized in order  to determine how access was granted.  Instead, \nthose claims, according to the Ericsson  Court, \u201c merely make \ngeneric functional recitations  that requests are made and then \ngranted.\u201d37  Here, in contrast, claim 1 does provide some  amount \nof specificity as to how requests for  access should be granted, \nspecifics that the  patent tells us were unconventional if used in the \nclaimed manner.  \n \nDefendant also argued that one of the key aspects of claim 1 \u2014 \nusing social networking group membership to c ontrol access to \nwireless  access points \u2014was not actually new at all.   In support, \nDefendant [] cited to a portion of  the prosecution history in which \nthe [E]xaminer, in assessing a prior art reference known as  Nath, \nappears to have concluded that Nath, in f act, disclosed this type of \nlimitation.  The  Court understands Defendant to be making this  \nargument because it believes that if it can  show that the record \nconclusively establishes  that this was not a new step, then this will  \nblunt Plaintiff \u2019s argument that the limitations  in claim 1 were, in \nfact, a new way of  controlling access to wireless access points , and \nthis will in turn harm Plaintiff \u2019s eligibility case.  \n \nThe argument, however, doesn\u2019 t alter the  Court \u2019s decision.  For \none thing, there ar e other relevant limitations in the claim, such  as \nthe use of performance data to control  access.  The addition of \nsuch performance -data-related limitations appear to  be what \n \n35  955 F.3d at 1326.  \n \n36   Id. at 1328.  \n \n37  Id. 13 \n caused the [E]xaminer to allow the patent  to issue, along with the \nother aspects of the  claim, and their existence in the claim could  \nstill help with Plaintiff \u2019s eligibility  argument here.  But the bigger \npoint is that in  citing to the prosecution history, all  Defendant has \ndone, at most, is to identify a  factual dispute in the record: one \nabout  whether the use of social networking group membership to \ncontrol access to wireless access  points was novel.  The \n[E]xaminer may have  concluded that it was (and the [E]xaminer \nmay have been right, or he may have been wrong to do so.) [.]  But \nthe patent, as I have noted, clearly asserts this was not  \nconventional.  And  at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the Court must  \naccept all of the Plaintiff \u2019s factual  allegations as true and construe \nthe record in  the light most favorable to the [P]laintiff.   Thus, from \nthis record, I must infer that this  use of social networking \ninformation was, in fact, a new way of attacking the network \naccess[ s] problem at issue.  Nor do I think Defendant has  \ndemonstrated that as a legal or factual matter  that Plaintiff \nsomehow a cquiesced to the  [E]xaminer \u2019s conclusion about Nath, \nand Defendant  has provided no caselaw suggesting that in \ncircumstances like these, a plaintiff has been  found to have so \nacquiesced.  So this issue  does not impact the Court \u2019s con clusion \neither.  \n \nIn sum, the Court recommends that  Defendant \u2019s motion to dismiss \non Section 101 grounds should be denied at step one with regard to \nthe representative claim or, in the alternative, at step two.  And as our Court has  noted in cases like F45 Training Party Limited  v. \nBody Fit Training USA Inc .,\n38 and eBuddy  Techs. B.V. v. LinkedIn \nCorp.,39 since the motion  should be denied as to Plaintiff \u2019s \npurportedly representative claim, it should also be denied  as to all \nother asserted claims.  \n \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed.
