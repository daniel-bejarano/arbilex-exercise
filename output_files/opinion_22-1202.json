NEWMAN ,   : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1202 -RGA  \n      : DELAWARE DIVISION OF MOTOR  : \nVEHICLES, et al.,     :  \n      :   Defendant s.   : \n \n Shantell  D. Newman , New Castle , Delaware.   Pro Se Plaintiff.  \n        \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n           \n \n        \n December 6, 20 22 \nWilmington, Delaware1 \n /s/ Richard G. Andrews  \nANDREWS, U.S. District Judge:  \n \n Plaintiff  Shantell Newman  appears pro se and has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis .  (D.I. 4 ).  She commenced this action on September 14, \n2022.  (D.I. 2).  T he Court proceeds to screen the Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  \n1915(e)(2) (B).   \nBACKGROUND  \n The following facts are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for \npurposes of screening the Complaint .  See Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs. , Inc. , 542 \nF.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).   Plaintiff sues Defendant s Delaware Division of Motor \nVehicles and the Justice of the Peace Court  on the grounds that she was forced to \nobtain a license to travel and forced to have insurance.   (D.I. 2 at 4).   While not clear, it \nappears that Plaintiff received a traffic citation(s) and there have been threats to \u201ctake \nher car.\u201d   (Id. at 7).   Plaintif f alleges violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1986, and 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2382. 0F1  (D.I. 2 at 6; D.I. 2-2). \n She seeks $500,000 in compensatory damages and contracts rescinded.  ( Id. at \n7).  \n \n \n1 To the extent that Plaintiff  seeks to impose criminal liability upon D efendants pursuant \nto the criminal statute upon which s he relies, she lacks standing to proceed.  See Allen \nv. Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts , 270 F. App\u2019 x 149, 150 (3d Cir. 2008); \nUnited States v. Fr iedland,  83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996) ( \u201c[T]he United States \nAttorney is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases within his or her district. \u201d).  The decision of whether to prosecute, and what criminal charges to bring, \ngenerally rests with the prosecutor.  See United States v. Batchelder , 442 U.S. 114, 124 \n(1979).   2 \n SCREENING OF COMPLAINT  \n A federal court may properly dismiss an act ion sua sponte  under the screening  \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)  if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d  Ball v. Famiglio , 726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir. \n2013) .  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) ( in forma pauperis  actions) .   The C ourt must accept \nall factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most favorable to a pro se plaintiff.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 229 (3d Cir. 2008); \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Because P laintiff proceeds pro se , her \npleading is liberally construed and h er Complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be \nheld to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. at  94.  \nA complaint is not automatically frivolous because it fails to state a claim.   See \nDooley v. Wetzel , 957 F.3d.  366, 374 (3d Cir.  2020) .  \u201cRather, a claim is frivolous only \nwhere it depends \u2018on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or a \u201cclearly baseless\u201d or \u201cfantastic or delusional\u201d factual scenario.\u2019\u201d  Id .   \n The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pur suant \nto \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is identical to the legal standard used when \nruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  Tourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999) .  However, before dismissing a complaint or claims  for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a71915 and 1915A , the C ourt must grant Plaintiff leave to amend her  complaint unless 3 \n amendment would be inequitable or futile.   See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , 293 \nF.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir. 2002) . \n A well- pleaded complaint must contain more than mere labels and conclusions.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 54 4 \n(2007).  A plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show that a claim has substantive \nplausibility.  See Johnson v. City of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10 (2014).  A complaint may not \ndismissed, however, for imperfect statements of the legal theory supporting the c laim \nasserted.  See id. at 1 1.  \n A court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must take three steps:  (1) take \nnote of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a claim; (2) identify allegations that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth; \nand (3) when there are well -pleaded factual allegations, assume their veracity and then \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Connelly v. Lane Const r. Corp ., 809 F.3d 780,  787 (3d Cir. 2016).   Elements are sufficiently alleged when \nthe facts in the complaint \u201cshow\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  Deciding whether a claim is plausible will be a \u201ccontext -specific t ask that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience \nand common sense.\u201d  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \n Defendants are immune from suit.   The DMV is an agency of the State of \nDelaware.  \u201c Absent a state\u2019 s consent, the eleventh amendment bars a civil rights suit in \nfederal court that names the state as a defendant.\u201d  Laskaris v. Thornburgh, 661 F.2d \n23, 25 (3d Cir. 1981) (citing Alabama v. Pugh , 438 U.S. 781 (1978) (per curiam)). The 4 \n State of Delaware has not waived its sovereign immunity under the Eleventh \nAmendment.  See Jones v. Attorney Gen. of Delaware, 737 F. App'x 642, 643 (3d Cir. \n2018). In addition, the DMV  \u201cis not a person\u201d subject to claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \nSee Will v. Mich. Dep \u2019t of State  Police , 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).  \n Similarly, Delaware\u2019s Justice of the Peace Court is immune from suit.    The  \nJustice of the Peace Court is a state entity and, thus, immune from suit.   See Benn v. \nFirst Judicial Dist. o f Pa., 426 F.3d 233, 239- 40 (3d Cir. 2005) (concluding that \nPennsylvania\u2019 s First Judicial District is a state entity entitled to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity) ; see T rammell  v. Court of Common Pleas Sussex County Courthouse, 2016 \nWL 7107224 (D. Del. Dec. 5, 2016).   \n Finally, the claim is frivolous .  While the right to travel includes \u201cthe right of a \ncitizen of one State to enter and to leave another State,\u201d the \u201cexact \u2018contours\u2019 of that \nright remain elusive.\u201d Owner Operator Independent Drivers Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm \u2019n, 934 F.3d 283, 294 (3d Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). In addition, the \nconstitutional right to travel does not restrict the State from regulating the use of its roads as a matter of its police powers. See United States v. Guest , 383 U.S. 745, 759 \nn.17 (196 6). Notably, the Supreme Court has recognized the power of states to regulate \nthe use of motor vehicles, including requirements for registration and licenses. Hendrick v. State of Maryland , 235 U.S. 610, 622  (1915).   \n CONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court will dismiss  the Complaint  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i ) and (iii) .  Amendment is futile.  \n An ap propriate O rder will be entered.   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \nSHANTELL D. NEWMAN,    : \n      : \n  Plaintiff,    : \n      :  v.     : Civil Action No. 22- 1202 -RGA  \n      : DELAWARE DIVISION OF MOTOR  : \nVEHICLES, et al.,     :  \n      : \n  Defendant s.   : \n \nORDER \n \n At Wilmington this 6th day of  December , 202 2, for the reasons set forth in the \nmemorandum opinion issued this date;  \n IT IS ORDERED that:  \n1. The Complaint is DISMISS ED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (i) \nand iii).  Amendment is futile.  \n2. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE  the case.  \n  \n                    /s/ Richard G. Andrews ___________  \n       UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  "}
