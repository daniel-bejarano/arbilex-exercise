INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff Annie May Weidner (\u201cWeidner\u201d) filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n405(g) on September 17, 2020 against the defendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting Commissioner\nof the Social Security Administration (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d). (D.I. 1) Weidner seeks judicial\nreview of the Commissioner\u2019s September 5, 2019 final decision denying Weidner\u2019s claim for\ndisability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-434. Currently before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment filed by\nWeidner and the Commissioner.\u201d (D.I. 15; D.I. 18) For the reasons set forth below, I\nrecommend that the court DENY Weidner\u2019s motion for summary judgment (D.I. 15), and\n\nGRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment (D.I. 18).\n\n' Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021.\nTherefore, pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Ms. Kijakazi is\nsubstituted as Defendant in place of Andrew Saul.\n\n2 The briefing for the present motions is as follows: Weidner\u2019s opening brief (D.I. 16), the\nCommissioner\u2019s combined opening brief in support of the motion for summary judgment and\nanswering brief in opposition to Weidner\u2019s motion (D.I. 19), and Weidner\u2019s answering brief in\nopposition to the Commissioner\u2019s motion and reply brief (D.I. 20).\nIL. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nWeidner filed a DIB application on May 21, 2018, alleging a disability onset date of May\n24, 2013 due to fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, three herniated discs, right ankle deterioration,\ndepression, migraine headaches, loss of strength in both hands, and locking of her left hip. (D.I.\n10-5 at 2-3; D.I. 10-6 at 6) Weidner\u2019s claims were denied initially in August 2018. (D.I. 10-3\nat 9) At Weidner\u2019s request, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on August 20,\n2019. (D.I. 10-2 at 35-76) The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on September 5, 2019,\nfinding that Weidner was not disabled under the Act because she could perform a reduced range\nof sedentary work. (/d. at 11-21) The Appeals Council subsequently denied Weidner\u2019s request\nfor review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the\nCommissioner. (Jd. at 2-4)\n\nWeidner brought this civil action challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision on September 17, 2020.\n(D.L. 1) Weidner filed her pending motion for summary judgment on May 10, 2021 (D.I. 15),\nand the Commissioner cross-moved for summary judgment on July 1, 2021 (D.I. 18). Briefing is\nnow complete.\n\nB. Medical History\n\nWeidner was 57 years old on December 31, 2015, her date last insured. (D.I. 10-2 at 41)\nWeidner has a ninth-grade education and has past relevant work as an accounts payable clerk and\nareceptionist. (/d.) The ALJ found that Weidner had the following severe impairments: tarsal\n\ntunnel syndrome of the left foot, status post-surgery and plantar fasciitis of the left foot status\n\n3 Weidner bears the burden of proving she was disabled as defined in the Act from the date of the\nalleged disability onset, May 24, 2013, through the date she was last insured, December 21,\n2015.\npost-surgery; osteoarthritis of the right ankle; right peroneal motor neuropathy; degenerative disc\ndisease of the cervical spine; and degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. (/d. at 13)\nWeidner challenges the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions, as opposed to the evidentiary basis for the\nALJ\u2019s decision, with a particular focus on Weidner\u2019s mental impairments and her cervical\ndegenerative disc disease. (D.I. 16) Because Weidner does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s factual or\nlegal conclusions regarding the balance of her impairments, the court does not address those\nconditions in detail here.\n\n1. Medical evidence\n\nIn March 2013, Weidner saw Martin A. Jacobson, M.D. for treatment of several\nconditions, including generalized anxiety. (D.I. 10-9 at 101) Dr. Jacobson indicated that\nWeidner was not interested in medication to treat her anxiety at the time. (/d.) She reported\nincreased anxiety in October 2013 after her in laws moved into her home and began taking\nXanax to treat her anxiety. (/d. at 104-05) Dr. Jacobson described Weidner as having normal\nmood and affect, normal behavior, and normal judgment and thought content. (/d. at 103, 105-\n06)\n\nIn March 2014, Weidner returned to Dr. Jacobson for treatment of her neck pain and\nanxiety, among other conditions. (D.I. 10-8 at 83) On physical examination, Weidner exhibited\na full range of motion in her neck, but she experienced pain with extension and tipping to the\nleft, which radiated to her left shoulder. (/d. at 84) With respect to Weidner\u2019s anxiety, Dr.\nJacobson continued to describe Weidner as having normal mood and affect, normal behavior,\nand normal judgment and thought content. (/d. at 85) Dr. Jacobson increased Weidner\u2019s\ngabapentin and tramadol dosage to address her neck pain, and he encouraged her to use Xanax\n\nmore often for her anxiety. (/d.)\nWeidner did not address her anxiety with Dr. Jacobson again until March 2015, when she\nexplained that her living situation with her in laws had exacerbated her anxiety. (D.I. 10-8 at 88)\nDr. Jacobson noted that Weidner was nervous and anxious, but she exhibited a normal mood and\naffect, normal behavior, and normal judgment and thought content. (/d. at 89-90) Dr. Jacobson\nindicated that Weidner\u2019s anxiety was stable with medication. (/d. at 90, 92)\n\nWeidner did not complain of neck pain again until her visit with Dr. Jessica Lynn\nSchwartz, D.O. in September 2015, when she indicated that the pain had grown worse over the\nlast three to four months. (D.J. 10-8 at 91) Although Weidner experienced pain in her neck and\nradiculopathy down her left arm when she turned her neck to the left, she represented that it did\nnot limit her ability to perform daily tasks. (/d.) A physical examination revealed a decreased\nrange of motion in her cervical back and left rotation stopped at 40 degrees due to pain, with no\ntenderness or spasm. (/d.at 92) Dr. Schwartz advised Weidner to obtain x-rays of her cervical\nspine and attend physical therapy. (/d. at 93)\n\nAn x-ray of Weidner\u2019s cervical spine taken the following month revealed mild-to-\nmoderate diffuse degenerative joint disease and mild foraminal narrowing. (D.I. 10-7 at 409)\nThe cervical vertebrae were normal in height and alignment, and no soft tissue swelling was\nnoted. (/d.) The findings were described as revealing \u201cage appropriate changes,\u201d and Weidner\nwas diagnosed with cervical spondylosis with radiculopathy. (/d. at 17) Physical therapy was\nrecommended. (/d.)\n\nIn November 2015, Weidner had an initial consultation at The Reading Neck & Spine\nCenter to assess her neck pain. (D.I. 10-7 at 15) At the time, Weidner indicated that her neck\npain had been constant for the past six to eight months, with pain radiating between her shoulder\n\nand throughout her left shoulder. (/d.) Weidner noted improvement with the use of a neck\npillow and worsening with turning her neck to the left. (/d.) Gabapentin, tramadol, and Tylenol\ngave Weidner minimal relief from her pain. (/d.) Weidner\u2019s treatment notes identified her\nhistory of depression and anxiety and described her occupation as \u201c[i]n-home caregiver,\u201d which\nwas \u201cphysically demanding without heavy lifting.\u201d (/d.) On physical examination, Weidner\nexhibited decreased range of motion in her cervical spine with left axial rotation, but full bilateral\nrange of motion in her shoulders with no tendermess in her cervical spine or shoulders. (Jd. at 16)\n\nWeidner visited rheumatologist Nancy J. Walker, M.D. in June 2016 for treatment of her\nankle and foot pain, neck pain, low back pain, osteoporosis, and fibromyositis. (D.I. 10-7 at 396,\n399) Dr. Walker identified Weidner\u2019s chronic low back pain, depressive symptoms, and\ndifficulty standing or walking for long periods without pain. (/d. at 396) Weidner described\nimprovement in her muscle pain with gabapentin, and she reported that tramadol helped her low\nback pain and sleep issues. (/d.)\n\nAn MRI of Weidner\u2019s cervical spine from June 2016 revealed cervical facet spondylosis.\n(DI. 10-8 at 340) In treatment notes from November 2016, Dr. Robert Salvage, M.D. indicated\nthat Weidner\u2019s cervical spine range of motion was restricted and she had paraspinal and occipital\ntenderness. (/d.) Dr. Salvage recommended that Weidner receive an epidural steroid injection.\n(Id. at 341)\n\n2. Medical opinions\n\nOn July 30, 2018, state agency psychological consultant Michelle R. Santilli, Psy.D.\nreviewed Weidner\u2019s medical records and observed that Weidner had not undergone a detailed\nmental status exam before December 31, 2015. (D.I. 10-3 at 7-8) Consequently, Dr. Santilli\nfound insufficient evidence of Weidner\u2019s ability to understand, remember, or apply information;\n\ninteract with others; concentrate, persist, or maintain pace; or adapt or manage herself. (Jd. at 7)\nOn August 1, 2018, state agency medical consultant James Butcofski, M.D. reviewed Weidner\u2019s\nrecords and found that there was insufficient evidence of record to support Weidner\u2019s claim for\ndisability prior to her date last insured. (D.I. 10-3 at 6)\n\nIn a physical residual functional capacity questionnaire dated September 13, 2018, Dr.\nSchwartz opined that Weidner\u2019s symptoms and functional limitations were impacted by her\ndepression, and those symptoms were enough to frequently interfere with her attention and\nconcentration. (D.I. 10-8 at 64) Dr. Schwartz indicated that Weidner could sit for 30 minutes\nand stand for 20 minutes at a time before needing to change positions, and she could sit and\nstand for less than two hours total in an eight-hour workday. (/d. at 65) Asa result, Dr.\nSchwartz opined that Weidner would need a job where she could change positions at will, take\nunscheduled breaks, elevate her legs, and utilize an assistive device for walking and standing.\n(Id. at 65-66) Dr. Schwartz also represented that Weidner could not move her head in any\ndirection. (/d. at 66) She estimated that Weidner would be absent from work four or more days\nper month. (/d. at 67)\n\nIn a physical residual functional capacity questionnaire dated September 27, 2018, Dr.\nWalker explained that she treated Weidner for fibromyalgia and spine conditions, and she noted\nWeidner\u2019s history of depression and anxiety. (D.I. 10-8 at 69-70) Dr. Walker opined that\nWeidner\u2019s symptoms would frequently interfere with her attention and concentration, she could\nsit and stand no more than 20 minutes at a time before needing to change position, and she could\nsit and stand less than two hours in an eight-hour workday. (Jd. at 70-71) Therefore, Dr. Walker\nopined that Weidner would need a job where she could change positions at will, take frequent\nunscheduled breaks, elevate her legs, and utilize an assistive device for walking and standing.\n\n(id. at 71-72) Dr. Walker also represented that Weidner could not move her head in any\ndirection, and she estimated that Weidner would be absent from work four or more days per\nmonth. (/d. at 72-73)\n3. Nonmedical evidence\n\nOn June 30, 2018, Weidner completed a function report outlining the symptoms of her\nconditions and their effect on her activities of daily living. (D.I. 10-6 at 76-85) Weidner\nreported that she had difficulty moving due to constant pain, and her depression made her tired\nand unhappy. (/d. at 76) Nonetheless, she indicated that she was able to fix meals, dust,\nvacuum, do laundry, walk her dog, and clean the kitchen and bathrooms, and she reported no\ndifficulty maintaining her personal care. (/d. at 77) She represented that she cared for her\nmother-in-law who lived with her, assisting her with meals, laundry, personal hygiene, and daily\nmedications. (/d.) She stated that she could drive a car, go out alone, go grocery shopping, and\nmanage her money. (Jd. at 79)\n\nDue her symptoms, Weidner stated that she can no longer bend, lift, stand, go to social\ngatherings, or sleep well. (D.I. 10-6 at 77) Although Weidner used to do yard work on a daily\nbasis and go antique or thrift store shopping on a weekly basis, she indicated that she could no\nlonger do yard work and only went thrift shopping once a month. (/d. at 80) Due to her\ndepression, her social activities were limited to phone calls with family members and taking her\ndog on weekly play dates. (/d.) She represented that she had difficulty getting along with others\nand had no desire to socialize, although she normally got along with authority figures. (Jd. at 81-\n82) She struggled to handle stress or changes to her routine. (/d. at 82) She also used a cane on\n\na daily basis. (/d.)\nC. Hearing Before the ALJ\n1. Weidner\u2019s Testimony\n\nDuring the August 20, 2019 hearing before the ALJ, Weidner testified that she lives with\nher husband and her mother-in-law, she has a ninth-grade education, and she does not have a\nGED. (D.I. 10-2 at 40-41) She previously worked in accounts payable doing data entry and\nfiling, and she worked as a front desk receptionist at an assisted living facility, which involved\ngreeting visitors, answering the phone, printing documents, and performing security checks. (Id.\nat 42-44) She also worked as a cashier, floor salesperson, and shelf stocker at a craft store. (Jd.\nat 46-47) She testified that she stopped working in 2011 due to pain in her back. (/d.) The ALJ\ndirected Weidner to three notations in her medical records suggesting that she stopped working\nat her retail position to care for her in-laws, but Weidner denied this was the case and said her\nmother-in-law is able to take care of herself. (/d. at 59-61)\n\nWeidner testified that she used a cane before her foot and ankle surgery in 2015, and she\nhas worn a brace on her right hand and wrist for years because she cannot use her right thumb.\n(D.I. 10-2 at 51-52) When describing her activities of daily living, Weidner said that she rests\nmost of the time now. (/d. at 55) During the relevant time period, she explained that her\ncondition got progressively worse and she avoided lifting, bending, or climbing stairs. (Jd. at 56)\nShe represented that her husband took care of most of the cleaning, grocery shopping, and\nlaundry. (/d.) A hemiated disc in her neck prevents her from moving her head in all directions\nand continues to impact her ability to watch television and read. (Jd. at 56-58) She reported\nproblems with walking more than a block and sitting more than twenty or thirty minutes during\nthe relevant time period. (Jd. at 64-65) Weidner testified that she attends to her own hygiene\n\nindependently. (/d. at 65)\nWeidner also stated that she sees her primary care physician and an arthritis specialist\ntwice a year. (D.I. 10-2 at 53-54) Her doctors prescribe medication, but the medication provides\nminimal relief. (/d. at 54)\n\n2. Vocational Expert Testimony Before the ALJ\n\nAt the administrative hearing in August 2019, the ALJ posed the following hypothetical\nto vocational expert Michelle Peters-Pagella (\u201cthe VE\u201d):\n\nI would like you to consider an individual ranging in age from 54 to 57 at DLI\n\nwho has a ninth grade education per testimony and work experience as you\u2019ve\n\ndescribed. I would like you to assume for the first hypothetical question that this\n\nindividual was capable of performing a range of light work as follows: lift and/or\n\ncarry 20 pounds occasionally, 10 pounds frequently; stand and/or walk for about\n\nsix hours in an eight-hour workday with normal breaks; sit for about six hours in\n\nan eight-hour workday with normal breaks; no more than occasionally climb,\n\nstoop, crouch, crawl kneel, and balance. If an individual were so limited and no\n\nother significant limitations could the person perform any of the past work in your\n\nopinion?\n\n(D.I. 10-2 at 71) In response to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the VE testified that such a hypothetical\nindividual would be able to perform Weidner\u2019s past work as an accounts payable clerk and a\nreceptionist. (Id.) The ALJ asked the VE if these positions would still be available to a\nhypothetical individual who could walk and stand no more than two hours in an eight-hour\nworkday, lift and carry ten pounds occasionally, and lift and carry less than ten pounds\nfrequently. (/d. at 71-72) The VE confirmed that the hypothetical individual could perform\nwork as an accounts payable clerk and receptionist as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational\nTitles (\u201cDOT\u201d) under those circumstances. (Id.) The ALJ next asked the VE if an employer\nwould tolerate an employee requiring extra breaks for about fifteen percent of the workday due\nto pain and discomfort. (D.I. 10-2 at 72) The VE responded that, if the hypothetical individual\n\nwere off task fifteen percent or more of the day outside of normal breaks, the individual would\n\nnot be able to sustain competitive employment. (/d.)\nThe ALJ then also inquired about another hypothetical individual:\n\nI\u2019d like you to assume that this individual could rarely lift less than ten pounds, sit\n\nless than two hours total; stand/walk less than two hours total; sit no more than 30\n\nminutes at a time and stand for no more than 20 minutes at a time; needs to\n\nelevate the legs; require use of a cane for ambulation; never look down, turn the\n\nhead to look up, or hold the head in a static position; rarely twist, stoop, crouch,\n\nsquat, and climb ladders; occasionally climb stairs; never grasp, turn, twist objects\n\nwith the right upper extremity, only occasionally left upper extremity; also would\n\nmiss more than four days of work per month. Obviously, there would be no\n\nwork; is that correct?\n\n(D.I. 10-2 at 72-73) The VE confirmed that such an individual would not be able to work. (Id.\nat 73) The VE further indicated that whether Weidner\u2019s past jobs would allow for a sit/stand\noption would depend on the ability to remain on task and the frequency of the sit/stand position\nchanges. (/d.) The VE explained that, while standing for a few minutes every hour would be\nacceptable, changing positions every fifteen minutes would not because the jobs require sitting\non a more frequent basis. (Id. at 73-74)\n\nIn response to questioning by Weidner\u2019s counsel, the VE testified that a hypothetical\nindividual\u2019s inability to frequently perform bilateral gross and fine manipulation and reaching\nwould preclude work as an accounts payable clerk or a receptionist. (D.I. 10-2 at 74-75) The\nVE further confirmed that limits on the hypothetical individual\u2019s ability to hold her head steady\nfor a significant period of time and rarely look to the sides, up, or down would preclude work as\nan accounts payable clerk or receptionist. (Jd. at 75)\n\nD. The ALJ\u2019s Findings\n\nBased on the factual evidence in the record and the testimony by Weidner and the VE,\nthe ALJ determined that Weidner was not disabled under the Act for the relevant time period\n\nfrom the May 24, 2013 disability onset date through the December 31, 2015 date last insured.\n\n(DI. 10-2 at 20) The ALJ found, in pertinent part:\n\n10\n1. The claimant last met the insured status requirements of the Social Security\nAct on December 31, 2015.\n\n2. The claimant did not engage in substantial gainful activity during the period\nfrom her alleged onset date of May 24, 2013 through her date last insured of\nDecember 31, 2015 (20 CFR 404.1571 et seq.).\n\n3. Through the date last insured, the claimant had the following severe\nimpairments: tarsal tunnel syndrome of the left foot, status post-surgery and\nplantar fasciitis of the left foot status post-surgery; osteoarthritis of the right\nankle; right peroneal motor neuropathy; degenerative disc disease of the\ncervical spine; and degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine (20 CFR\n404.1520(c)).\n\n4. Through the date last insured, the claimant did not have an impairment or\ncombination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of one\nof the listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR\n404.1520(d), 404.1525 and 404.1526).\n\n5. After careful consideration of the entire record, I find that, through the date\nlast insured, the claimant had the residual functional capacity to perform\nsedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) except with the following\nadditional limitations. The claimant was able to lift and/or carry 20 pounds\noccasionally and 10 pounds frequently. She could stand and/or walk for two\nhours of an eight-hour workday with normal breaks and sit for six hours of an\neight-hour workday with normal breaks. She could no more than occasionally\nclimb, stoop, crouch, crawl, kneel, and balance.\n\n6. Through the date last insured, the claimant was capable of performing past\nrelevant work as an accounts payable clerk and receptionist. This work did\nnot require the performance of work-related activities precluded by the\nclaimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (20 CFR 404.1565).\n\n7. The claimant was not under a disability, as defined in the Social Security Act,\nat any time from May 24, 2013, the alleged onset date, through December 31,\n2015, the date last insured (20 CFR 404.1520(f)).\n\n(D.I. 10-2 at 13-20)\n\n11\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nJudicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether substantial\nevidence supports the decision.* See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3); Biestek v. Berryhill, 139\nS. Ct. 1148, 1154 (2019). \u201cSubstantial evidence means enough relevant evidence that \u2018a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d Pearson v. Comm'r of Soc.\nSec., 839 F. App\u2019x 684, 687 (3d Cir. 2020) (quoting Biestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154). When applying\nthe substantial evidence standard, the court \u201clooks to an existing administrative record and asks\nwhether it contains \u2018sufficien[t] evidence\u2019 to support the agency\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d\nBiestek, 139 S. Ct. at 1154 (citing Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)).\nThe threshold for satisfying the substantial evidence standard is \u201cnot high[,]\u201d requiring \u201cmore\nthan a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. Id.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Disability Determination Process\n\nTitle II of the Act affords insurance benefits to people who contributed to the program\nand who have a disability. See Pearson, 839 F. App\u2019x at 687 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)). A\ndisability is the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically\ndeterminable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which\nhas lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is only disabled if the impairments are so severe that they\n\n4 In her reply brief, Weidner concedes that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial\nevidence. (See, e.g., D.I. 20 at 1-2) Instead, Weidner argues that the ALJ made a series of legal\nerrors in his decision. (/d.) The Third Circuit has recognized that the court may assess whether\nthe Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. See Friedberg v. Schweiker, 721 F.2d\n445, 447 (3d Cir. 1983). Courts exercise plenary review of legal issues and review the ALJ\u2019s\nfindings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. Schaudeck v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir. 1999) (internal citations omitted).\n\n12\npreclude a return to previous work or engagement in any other kind of substantial gainful work\nexisting in the national economy. /d. at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 21-22\n(2003). To qualify for disability insurance benefits, a claimant must establish disability prior to\nthe date last insured. 20 C-F.R. \u00a7 404.131 (2016); Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611-12 (3d\nCir. 2014).\n\nThe Commissioner must perform a five-step analysis to determine whether a person is\ndisabled. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; Plummer v. Apfel, 186 F.3d 422, 427-28 (3d Cir. 1999). If\nthe Commissioner makes a finding of disability or non-disability at any point in the sequential\nprocess, the Commissioner will not review the claim further. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). At\nstep one, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in any substantial\ngainful activity. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial\ngainful activity, step two requires the Commissioner to determine whether the claimant is\nsuffering from a severe impairment or a severe combination of impairments. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii).\n\nIf the claimant\u2019s impairments are severe, at step three, the Commissioner compares the\nclaimant\u2019s impairments to a list of impairments that are presumed severe enough to preclude any\ngainful work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. When a claimant\u2019s\nimpairment or its equivalent matches a listed impairment, the claimant is presumed disabled. See\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If a claimant\u2019s impairment, either singly or in combination, fails\nto meet or medically equal any listing, the analysis continues to steps four and five. See id. at \u00a7\n404.1520(e).\n\nAt step four, the ALJ considers whether the claimant retains the residual functional\n\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform past relevant work. See id. at \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv); Plummer, 186\n\n13\nF.3d at 428. A claimant\u2019s RFC \u201cmeasures the most she can do despite her limitations.\u201d Zirnsak\nv. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1)) (internal\nquotations and alterations omitted). The claimant bears the burden of demonstrating the inability\nto return to past relevant work. See Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428\n\nIf the claimant is unable to return to past relevant work, at step five, the Commissioner\nmust demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s impairments do not preclude an adjustment to any other\navailable work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g); Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. In other words, the\nCommissioner must prove that \u201cthere are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy which the claimant can perform, consistent with her medical impairments, age,\neducation, past work experience, and [RFC].\u201d Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428. The ALJ must\nanalyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining whether he or she\nis capable of performing work and is not disabled. See id. The ALJ often seeks the VE\u2019s\nassistance in making this finding. See id.\n\nB. Whether the ALJ\u2019s Decision is Based on Legal Error\n\nWeidner does not challenge whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial\nevidence. (D.I. 20 at 1-2) (\u201cMs. Weidner has not argued that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported\nby substantial evidence. ... Ms. Weidner has in no way asked this Court to re-weigh the\nevidence of record.\u201d). Instead, Weidner contends that the ALJ committed legal error in several\naspects of the written decision: (1) the ALJ failed to account for the composite nature of\nWeidner\u2019s past work as a receptionist and an accounts payable clerk; (2) the ALJ failed to adopt\ncredible mental limitations and develop the administrative record regarding Weidner\u2019s mental\nimpairments; (3) the ALJ erred in the evaluation of the medical opinion evidence; and (4) the\n\nALJ failed to include functional restrictions in the RFC analysis to account for Weidner\u2019s\n\n14\ncervical degenerative disc disease. (D.I. 20)\n1. Weidner\u2019s past work\n\nWeidner argues that the ALJ erred at step four of the sequential evaluation process when\nhe found that she could perform her past relevant work as an accounts payable clerk and a\nreceptionist because these positions, as performed by Weidner, were composite jobs requiring\nthe performance of elements of two or more jobs. (D.I. 16 at 4) According to Weidner, the\nreceptionist position also entailed security duties and the emergency provision of personal care to\nassisted living residents, and the accounts payable position involved lifting and carrying heavy\nboxes upstairs for filing. (Jd. at 4-6) In response, the Commissioner contends that Weidner\u2019s\npast positions were not composite jobs because the additional tasks performed by Weidner either\nfell outside the scope of the job requirements or they did not amount to significant elements of\nanother position. (D.I. 19 at 22-23)\n\nAt step four, the claimant bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating an inability to\nreturn to her past relevant work. Plummer, 186 F.3d at 428; Ramirez v. Barnhart, 372 F.3d 546,\n550-51 (3d Cir. 2004). \u201cWhen significant variations exist between a claimant\u2019s description of\npast work and the [DOT\u2019s] description of work, an ALJ may consider whether the job is a\n\u2018composite job,\u2019\u201d which is defined as a job containing \u201csubstantial elements of two or more\noccupations\u201d that lacks any counterpart in the DOT. Reed v. Berryhill, 337 F. Supp. 3d 525, 529\n(E.D. Pa. 2018) (citing SSR 82-61, 1982 WL 31387, at *2 (S.S.A. Jan. 1, 1982)). \u201cIn other\nwords, a composite position must involve additional \u2018main duties\u2019 from another DOT position,\nrather than \u2018merely excessive function[s] with the job duties from one DOT position.\u201d\u201d Jd.\n\n(quoting Giddings v. Berryhill, 2018 WL 4252426, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 5, 2018)).\n\n15\nThe additional duties identified by Weidner in her testimony regarding her work as a\nreceptionist and an accounts payable clerk cannot fairly be characterized as \u201cmain duties\u201d of\nanother DOT position. In describing her role as a receptionist at an assisted living facility,\nWeidner testified that she performed security checks twice a week at the end of her shift to\nensure that the interior doors were locked on all three floors of the facility. (D.I. 10-2 at 43-44,\n48, 67-71) She estimated that the task took her approximately fifteen minutes to complete. (Jd.\nat 68) The VE expressly considered this task and concluded that the receptionist position should\nnot be characterized as a combination job with a security guard because \u201cit was more or less it\nappears checking doors to make sure they were locked.\u201d (Jd. at 70-71) On this record, the ALJ\ndid not err in rejecting Weidner\u2019s suggestion that her prior work as a receptionist involved the\nadditional \u201cmain duties\u201d of a security guard.\n\nMoreover, the ALJ did not err in rejecting Weidner\u2019s assertion that the occasional\nphysical assistance she provided to residents transformed her past work as a receptionist into a\ncomposite job. Weidner\u2019s own testimony confirms that she was not supposed to lift or\nphysically assist residents as part of her job duties. (D.I. 10-2 at 44, 49, 70) The VE explained\nthat the receptionist position may not be described as sedentary if Weidner was required to assist\nresidents, but Weidner responded that \u201cit [w]as not \u2014 that was not a part of my job.\u201d (D.I. 10-2 at\n70) Weidner\u2019s past work as a receptionist cannot be construed as a composite job based on her\nperformance of a task falling outside the scope of her job responsibilities. Therefore, the ALJ\ndid not err in finding that Weidner could perform her past relevant work as a receptionist as the\njob was generally performed. (D.I. 10-2 at 20)\n\nMoreover, the ALJ did not err in his assessment of Weidner\u2019s past work as an accounts\n\npayable clerk when he declined to find that the job also incorporated the primary duties of a file\n\n16\nclerk. (D.I. 10-2 at 20) Weidner\u2019s filing duties in her accounts payable position were minimal,\nas evidenced by Weidner\u2019s own testimony that she carried boxes of files once every two days,\nand she confirmed that the majority of her time on the job was spent sitting. (D.I. 10-2 at 42)\nCourts within the Third Circuit have noted that the role of a file clerk requires standing and\nwalking about half of the time. See Giddings, 2018 WL 4252426, at *4. Accordingly, the ALJ\nwas under no obligation to treat Weidner\u2019s accounts payable position as a composite job\nincorporating the \u201cmain duties\u201d of a file clerk.\n\n2. Weidner\u2019s mental impairments\n\nWeidner alleges that the ALJ erred by failing to explain why he did not incorporate her\nmild, non-severe mental impairments into the RFC analysis or the hypothetical posed to the VE.\n(D.1. 16 at 6-8; D.I. 20 at 4) According to Weidner, the ALJ\u2019s error is not harmless because\nthose mild limitations affect her ability to perform her past relevant work in semi-skilled and\nskilled positions. (D.I. 16 at 9-12) Weidner also argues that the ALJ should have sought further\ndevelopment of the record instead of assessing the severity of Weidner\u2019s mental impairments\nbased on his own lay speculation. (/d. at 13-16) In response, the Commissioner argues that the\nALJ was not required to incorporate Weidner\u2019s mild mental limitations into the RFC assessment\nor further develop the record regarding Weidner\u2019s mental impairments because the evidence of\nrecord was sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination. (D.I. 19 at 6-9)\n\nThe ALJ did not err in failing to incorporate limitations associated with Weidner\u2019s mild\nmental impairments in the RFC and the hypotheticals posed to the VE. An individual\u2019s RFC is\nan assessment of the most that person can still do in a work setting, despite the limitations caused\nby her impairments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a). The ALJ must consider limitations imposed by\n\nall of an individual\u2019s impairments, even those that are not \u201csevere.\u201d Id.; SSR 96-8. However,\n\n17\nthe ALJ\u2019s consideration of the individual\u2019s non-severe impairments does not amount to a\nrequirement that the ALJ must include limitations in the RFC associated with mild impairments.\nSee Smith v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2016 WL 3912850, at *9 (D.N.J. July 19, 2016) (concluding\nthat the ALJ did not err in declining to include mental limitations in the RFC because he clearly\nconsidered the plaintiff's depression and concluded that the symptoms did not significantly limit\nher basic work activities).\n\nIn this case, the ALJ considered Weidner\u2019s mental impairments at step two of the\nsequential evaluation and found that her \u201cdepression and generalized anxiety disorder did not\ncause more than minimal limitation in the claimant\u2019s ability to perform basic mental work\nactivities and were therefore non-severe.\u201d (D.I. 10-2 at 14) Applying the four areas of mental\nfunctioning set forth in the regulations, the ALJ determined that Weidner had no limitation in her\nability to understand, remember, or apply information based on evidence showing that Weidner\ncould manage money and shop in stores. (/d.) The ALJ found \u201cat most a mild limitation\u201d in the\nfunctional areas of interacting with others; concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace; and\nadapting or managing oneself. (/d. at 14-15)\n\nIn similar circumstances, the Third Circuit has clarified that the ALJ\u2019s broad findings of\nlimitations at step two should not outweigh the substance of the ALJ\u2019s overall review. See\nHolley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 590 F. App\u2019x 167, 168 (3d Cir. 2014) (rejecting the claimant\u2019s\nargument that the ALJ erred by failing to tell the vocational expert she had moderate difficulties\nin concentration, persistence, and pace). Here, the ALJ noted that Weidner reported no difficulty\ngetting along with authority figures, she had no issues finishing what she starts, and she was\ncapable of tending to her personal care and going out independently. (D.I. 10-2 at 14-15) The\n\nALJ explained that Weidner\u2019s medical records consistently showed she exhibited a normal\n\n18\nmood, affect, judgment, and behavior, exhibiting no deficits in concentration, persistence, or\npace. (Id) The ALJ\u2019s analysis confirms that the ALJ had sound knowledge of the entire record\nbefore making his decision about Weidner\u2019s RFC. Holley, 590 F. App\u2019x at 168; see Shaffer v.\nColvin, 2014 WL 4925067, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2014) (\u201cIt is clear from the record that the\nALJ adequately considered all of the relevant medical evidence, as well as plaintiffs reported\nactivities, in assessing plaintiffs residual functional capacity, and that he incorporated into his\nfinding all of the limitations that reasonably could be supported by the medical and other\nrelevant evidence.\u201d); McCafferty v. Astrue, 2008 WL 1869282, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 25, 2008)\n(finding that the requirements of SSR 96-8p were satisfied by ALJ\u2019s narrative discussion of the\nclaimant\u2019s functional limitations in the context of the objective medical evidence, doctors\u2019 notes\nand opinions, the claimant\u2019s activities of daily living, and the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints).\nIn support of the statements made in the written decision, the ALJ cited medical records\nfrom Weidner\u2019s rheumatologist and primary care physicians because Weidner did not seek\ntreatment with a specialist for her mental impairments, and those records show that Weidner\u2019s\nanxiety was controlled with medication. (D.I. 10-2 at 14-15; D.I. 10-8 at 90, 92) Moreover, the\ntranscript of the hearing before the ALJ shows that Weidner did not describe any symptoms\nstemming from her mental impairments, nor did her counsel pose questions to the VE regarding\nlimitations resulting from her mental impairments. (D.I. 10-2 at 40-75); see Trauterman v.\nComm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 296 F. App\u2019x 218, 219 (3d Cir. 2008) (upholding ALJ\u2019s determination of\nnon-severe depression at step two where the claimant did not identify a mental or emotional\nproblem requiring treatment by a mental health professional in her testimony before the ALJ).\nThe ALJ appropriately exercised his discretion in declining to include limitations addressing\n\nWeidner\u2019s mental impairments in the hypothetical posed to the VE or the RFC assessment based\n\n19\non the thin evidence of limitations caused by those alleged impairments. Holley, 590 F. App\u2019x at\n168-69; Wardell v. Berryhill, C.A. No. 18-918-RGA, 2019 WL 1579501, at *6-7 (D. Del. Apr.\n12, 2019) (upholding the ALJ\u2019s determination that mild mental limitations not impacting the\nclaimant\u2019s ability to function need not be included in the hypothetical posed to the VE or the\nRFC assessment); Shaffer, 2014 WL 4925067, at *5-6 (finding no error in the ALJ\u2019s failure to\ninclude limitations arising from the claimant\u2019s non-severe mental impairments in the RFC\nfinding because there was \u201cno authority from this circuit suggesting that someone with merely\n\u2018mild\u2019 difficulties . . . should be limited to unskilled work or simple, routine tasks.\u201d).\n\nIn addition, the ALJ did not err by failing to further develop the record regarding\nWeidner\u2019s mental impairments. An ALJ has a duty to fully and fairly develop the record to\nmake a determination of disability. See Ventura v. Shalala, 55 F.3d 900, 902 (3d Cir. 1995).\nThe ALJ has the discretion to arrange for consultative examinations if the necessary information\nis not readily available from the claimant\u2019s treating sources. See Thompson v. Halter, 45 F.\nApp\u2019x 146, 149 (3d Cir. 2002); Schwartz v. Halter, 134 F. Supp. 2d 640, 657-58 (E.D. Pa. 2001);\nsee also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513. However, the ultimate responsibility for producing evidence of a\ndisability rests with the claimant. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a); Money v. Barnhart, 91 F. App\u2019x\n210, 215 (3d Cir. 2004). Accordingly, \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the record does not require a\nconsultative examination unless the claimant establishes that such an examination is necessary to\nenable the ALJ to make the disability decision.\u201d Thompson, 45 F. App\u2019x at 149. \u201cThe ALJ\u2019s\nduty is only \u2018to ensure that the claimant\u2019s complete medical history is developed on the record\nbefore finding that the claimant is not disabled.\u2019\u201d Shields v. Saul, C.A. No. 20-687-JLH, 2021\n\nWL 2209869, at *4 (D. Del. June 1, 2021) (quoting Money, 91 F. App\u2019x at 216).\n\n20\nWeidner suggests that the ALJ was required to obtain the opinion of an appropriate\nmedical professional after discounting the opinion of state agency psychologist Dr. Santilli,\nwhich was the only medical source opinion in the record regarding Weidner\u2019s mental\nimpairments. (D.I. 16 at 14-16) But courts in the Third Circuit have determined that an \u201cALJ is\nnot precluded from reaching RFC determinations without outside medical expert review of each\nfact incorporated into the decision.\u201d Chandler v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 667 F.3d 356, 362 (3d\nCir. 2011); see also Carter v. Colvin, 2015 WL 1866208, at *10 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 23, 2015). In\nthis case, the ALJ determined that Dr. Santilli\u2019s opinion regarding the insufficiency of the\nevidence of record was not persuasive because Weidner\u2019s medical records established her\ndiagnosis and treatment for depression and generalized anxiety disorder during the relevant time\nperiod. (D.I. 10-2 at 15) Instead of relying on his own lay opinion as Weidner suggests, the ALJ\nrelied on Weidner\u2019s testimony and function reports establishing her ability to get along with\nauthority figures, finish what she starts, tend to her personal care, and go out independently. (Jd.\nat 14-15) Moreover, the ALJ cited Weidner\u2019s medical records showing consistent findings of\nnormal mood, affect, judgment, and behavior, with no deficits in concentration, persistence, or\npace.\u2019 (/d.) Because the record contains substantial evidence upon which the ALJ relied in\n\nmaking his decision, the ALJ\u2019s failure to obtain a consultative psychological examination or\n\n5 This same evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to find Weidner\u2019s mental impairments to be\nnon-severe at step two of the sequential analysis. See Maddaloni v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 340 F.\nApp\u2019x 800, 802 (3d Cir. 2009) (\u2018The record before us contains substantial evidence to support\nthe ALJ\u2019s findings that Maddaloni\u2019s functional limitations were either \u2018mild\u2019 or \u2018none\u2019\u201d in the\nfour areas of mental functioning, supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination of a non-severe mental\nimpairment); Salles v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 229 F. App\u2019x 140, 145 (3d Cir. 2007) (finding that\ndiagnosis of depression, by itself, was not enough to establish severity at step two, and the\nclaimant was required to present evidence showing that the impairment significantly limited her\ncapacity to cope with the mental demands of working).\n\n21\nother medical opinion regarding Weidner\u2019s mental condition was not an abuse of discretion. See\nPekmezovic v. Colvin, 2016 WL 7104385, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 6, 2016).\n3. Medical opinion evidence\n\nWeidner next alleges that the ALJ erred in evaluating the medical opinion evidence of her\ntreating physicians, Drs. Walker and Scwhartz, by not sufficiently addressing the consistency\nbetween their medical opinions and instead crafting an RFC finding without any supporting\nmedical opinion evidence. (D.I. 16 at 17-22) The Commissioner responds that the ALJ properly\nconsidered the fact that the medical opinions of Drs. Walker and Schwartz were issued nearly\nthree years after the date last insured, and neither doctor maintained a treatment relationship with\nWeidner for the duration of the relevant time period. (D.I. 19 at 14-15) In addition, the\nCommissioner contends that the ALJ properly evaluated the consistency and supportability of the\nopinions by evaluating them against the objective medical evidence, the physicians\u2019 own\ntreatment notes, and Weidner\u2019s daily activities. (/d. at 15-16)\n\nIn accordance with the revised regulatory framework for claims filed on or after March\n27, 2017, which eliminated the treating physician rule, an ALJ is not required to give any\n\u201cspecific evidentiary weight, including controlling weight, to any medical opinion(s) . . .,\nincluding those from [a] medical source.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(a). Instead, the ALJ must\nconsider the persuasiveness of all medical opinions based on the application of five factors:\n(1) supportability; (2) consistency; (3) relationship with the claimant; (4) specialization; and\n(5) other factors. Id. at \u00a7 404.1520c(a)-(c). The ALJ must explain how he considered the most\nimportant factors of supportability and consistency. Id. at \u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2). \u201cConsistency\nconcerns the degree to which the opinion reflects the same limitations described in evidence\n\nfrom other sources, whereas supportability concerns the relevancy of objective medical evidence\n\n22\nand degree of explanation given by the medical source to support the limitations assessed in the\nopinion.\u201d Eader v. Saul, 2020 WL 10898140, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 20, 2020) (quoting Serowski\nv. Comm \u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2020 WL 6383187, at *12-13 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 30, 2020)). There is no\nrequirement for the ALJ to discuss or explain consideration of the remaining factors unless there\nare two or more medical opinions which are equally well supported and consistent with the\nrecord, but not exactly the same, in which case the ALJ must explain how he differentiated the\nopinions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(b)(2)-(3).\n\nIn this case, the ALJ determined that the opinions of Weidner\u2019s treating sources, Dr.\nSchwartz and Dr. Walker, were not persuasive because the limitations therein were not supported\nby the treating sources\u2019 own examination findings or Weidner\u2019s self-reported activities of daily\nliving,\u00ae the opinions were rendered nearly three years after Weidner\u2019s date last insured, and each\nof the treating sources only saw Weidner for a fraction of the relevant time period. (D.I. 10-2 at\n19) For example, the ALJ explained that limitations of sitting, standing, and walking for less\nthan two hours total of an eight-hour workday were inconsistent with Dr. Walker\u2019s treatment\nnotes reporting that Weidner walked her dog daily, drove, and had normal balance and gait. (/d.)\nThe ALJ also suggested that opinions regarding Weidner\u2019s inability to look down or turn her\nhead were not supported by Dr. Schwartz\u2019s treatment records from September 2015 stating that\n\nWeidner\u2019s neck pain did not limit her ability to do anything. (/d.) In this regard, the ALJ\n\n6 Weidner challenges the ALJ\u2019s \u201cextensive\u201d reliance on her care for her in-laws in his decision,\npointing out that her in-laws had an aide. (D.I. 16 at 21) But the ALJ\u2019s discussion of Weidner\u2019s\ncaregiving duties in his discussion of the medical opinion evidence is limited to a single sentence\nnoting that treatment records from September 2015 and March 2016 describe Weidner as \u201cbeing\nmostly the primary caregiver for her in-laws who required a lot of help.\u201d (D.I. 10-2 at 19) A\nreview of the record demonstrates that this is a salient point. Although Weidner now claims that\nshe stopped working due pain caused by her impairments, three sets of medical records from in\nand around the relevant time period indicated that she stopped working to care for her in-laws.\n(DI. 10-2 at 59-61; D.L. 10-7 at 15, 435-36; D.I. 10-8 at 91)\n\n23\ndirectly addressed the limitations expressed in the opinions and articulated why he found them to\nbe inconsistent with Weidner\u2019s treatment notes. See Cotter v. Harris, 642 F.2d 700, 706 (3d Cir.\n1981) (holding that an ALJ may not \u201creject evidence for no reason or for the wrong reason.\u201d).\nThe ALJ\u2019s assessment meets the standard in the new regulations, and his determination is\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\nWeidner argues that the ALJ\u2019s analysis under the new regulations is erroneous because\nthe opinions of Drs. Schwartz and Walker were consistent. But the regulations suggest that\nWeidner\u2019s definition of \u201cconsistency\u201d is too narrow. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(c)(2),\n\u201c[t]he more consistent a medical opinion(s) . . . is with the evidence from other medical sources\nand nonmedical sources in the claim, the more persuasive the medical opinion(s) . . . will be.\u201d\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c(c)(2). Thus, the inquiry regarding consistency is directed to the record as\na whole, and not just to the narrow universe of medical opinions. See Laicha v. Kijakazi, 2021\nWL 3929739, at *12 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 2, 2021) (upholding ALJ\u2019s rejection of treating source\nopinion as unpersuasive because \u201cthe opinion was inconsistent with his treatment notes .. . as\nwell as [the claimant\u2019s] self-reported activities of daily living.\u201d). To the extent that the ALJ\u2019s\nopinion does not expressly use the word \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201cconsistency,\u201d this is not sufficient to\nrequire remand because the ALJ plainly considered the consistency of the medical opinions with\nthe evidence of record. See Diaz v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 577 F.3d 500, 504 (3d Cir. 2009) (\u201cThe\nALJ... need not employ particular \u2018magic\u2019 words.\u201d).\n\n4. Weidner\u2019s cervical degenerative disc disease\nFinally, Weidner contends that the ALJ erred by failing to include any functional\n\nrestrictions in his RFC to account for Weidner\u2019s severe cervical degenerative disc disease. (D.L\n\n24\n16 at 22-23) Weidner argues that the limitations resulting from her severe cervical degenerative\ndisc disease would have precluded her from performing her past jobs. (/d. at 23)\n\nPage 16 of the Commissioner\u2019s brief points out the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Weidner\u2019s\ncervical spine condition based upon the medical records of Dr. Schwartz in the three months\nprior to the date she was last insured.\u2019 (D.I. 19 at 16) As previously discussed at \u00a7 IV.B.3,\nsupra, Dr. Schwartz\u2019s treatment notes reveal no limitations that should have been included in the\nRFC\u2019s finding.\n\nCourts within the Third Circuit have rejected the position that an ALJ is required to\ninclude limitations in an RFC specific to each severe impairment, stating that \u201cthere is no\nrequirement for such a one-to-one correlation between a severe impairment and a limitation\nincluded in the RFC.\u201d Smith v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., 2017 WL 5046371, at *1 n.1 (W.D. Pa.\nSept. 13, 2017). Here, the ALJ accounted for Weidner\u2019s severe impairments as a whole by\nlimiting her to sedentary work with additional postural restrictions. (D.I. 10-2 at 16) The ALJ\nexpressly discussed Weidner\u2019s cervical degenerative disc disease and acknowledged Weidner\u2019s\ncomplaints that she had problems moving her neck. (/d.) However, the ALJ found that\nWeidner\u2019s neck problems did not require any limitations beyond those already included in the\nRFC in light of treatment records reporting that the pain she experienced when turning her head\nto the left \u201cwas not limiting her ability to do anything,\u201d and x-rays and examinations revealed a\n\ndecreased range of motion but no tenderness or spasm in her cervical spine. (/d. at 18)\n\n7 Weidner incorrectly contends that the Commissioner waived any defense by failing to respond\non this issue. (D.I. 20 at 10) Regardless, a defendant\u2019s failure to respond \u201cis not alone a\nsufficient basis for the entry of summary judgment.\u201d Anchorage Assocs. v. Virgin Islands Bd. of\nTax Review, 922 F.2d 168, 175 (3d Cir. 1990). Even where a party does not oppose a movant\u2019s\nargument, the court must still find that the circumstances warrant judgment as a matter of law.\nSee Miller v. Ashcroft, 76 F. App\u2019x 457, 462 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n25\nAccordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that the limitations included\nin the RFC were sufficient to address Weidner\u2019s severe cervical degenerative disc disease.\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court DENY Weidner\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment (D.I. 15) and GRANT the Commissioner\u2019s cross-motion for summary\njudgment (D.I. 18).\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objection and responses to the objections are limited to ten (10)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage v. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court's Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated October 9, 2013, a copy of which is available on the court's website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: February 1, 2022\n\nUnited States\n\n26\n"}
