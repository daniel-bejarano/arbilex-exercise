Chen, Cryst al Nix -Hines, Shon Morgan, Meredith R. \nMandell, QUINN EMANUEL URQUHART & SULLIVAN , LLP,  Los Angeles, California . \n \nCounsel for Defendant.  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nNovember 2 6, 2021  \n  2 BIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nPlaintiffs  hail from five different states . But they are united as buyers of 2016 or \n2017 Chevrolet Camaro s. And they are not pleased  about it. Those cars, they allege,  \nhave defective starter motor s. \nThe drivers  sue G eneral Motors , which owns Chevrolet.  They claim that when GM \nsupplied defective Camaros  it breach ed express and implied warranties, violat ed \ncountless consumer -protection laws, and was unjust ly enriched.  And t hey bring these \nclaims in a class action  on behalf of other Camaro owners.  \nGM contests almost  everything the drivers say. It has  moved to dismiss every \nclaim and to strike the class allegations. Sometimes GM is right.  The drivers sue \nunder a federal law that requires 100 plaintiffs, but they muster only eight.  And a  \nfew drivers took too long to su e. Still others failed to get  repairs within the warranty \nperiod. Plus, GM is right that applying the unjust -enrichment laws of fifty states \nwould be too unwieldy . So I will dismiss and strike some of the claims.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. The starter defect  \nWhen turned,  a car key triggers the  starter motor , which  engage s the car\u2019s engine. \nBecause  the starter  is so close to the engine, it  can absorb a lot of heat . First Am. \nCompl ., D.I. 22 \u00b6 112. That  can cause the starter to fail. Id . To prevent this , manufac-\nturers install heat shields . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 113, 121.  \nThe drivers say that every Camaro since model year 2010 has a defective heat \nshield . Id. \u00b6\u00b6 116, 121\u2013 25. As a result , they claim , their starters  are exposed to exces-\nsive heat, damaging them and other important parts. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 114\u201316. The d rivers  call 3 this problem \u201cthe starter defect.\u201d  So will I , sparing  the reader words like \u201c solenoid ,\u201d \n\u201cflywheel,\u201d and \u201cpinion gear. \u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 109\u201310. \nThe drivers  say that the  starter defect makes their cars unsafe.  Id. \u00b6 118. They \nsay it can cause the ir cars to start slowly , not start at all , or stall mid -drive. Id. Wha t-\never the flaw, the  drivers  say the defect makes them  \u201cmore likely to be involved in a \ncollision because the vehicle cannot move on its own.\u201d Id. \nThe drivers say this problem is so common  that GM drafted a document  instruct-\ning dealerships on  \u201cthe replacement of the starter \u2026 due to heat damage from the \nengine.\u201d Id. \u00b6 131. Plus, some dealerships admitted that they were \u201caware\u201d of the \nstarter defect . Id. \u00b6 143. \nB. The drivers  and their claims  \nDistressed by their mounting repair bills, the drivers bring a class  action against \nGM. Eight named plaintiffs  sue under the law s of five states:  \n\u2022 Talley  (Maryland) ;  \n\u2022 Previti and Franzen (California );  \n\u2022 the Loadholtes es and Seale (Florida );  \n\u2022 Harris (Georgia ); and  \n\u2022 Miller (Pennsylvania ).  \nBecause the drivers  allege a violation of federal law, they also sue on behalf  of every-\none in the United States  who bought or leased a post -2010 Camaro.  4 The drivers allege that  GM violated a raft  of federal and state consumer -protection \nlaws , breached the warranties  (express and implied)  that came with their cars , and \nunjustly enriched itself by selling cars that it knew were defective.  \nGM moves to dismiss  these claims and to strike the class allegations.  To decide \nthese motions, I take every factual assertion in the complaint as true.  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nII. MOST  OF THE CONSUMER -PROTECTION CLAIMS SURVIVE  \nThe drivers assert that GM violated a legion of state laws banning  unfair or de-\nceptive trade practices. See, e.g.,  Fla. Stat. \u00a7  501.204(1).  They say those laws required \nGM to tell consumers about the starter defect. GM parries with five  arguments : \n\u2022 It had no duty to disclose  the starter defect , D.I. 24, at  6; \n\u2022 the drivers n ever pleaded an affirmative act of concealment beyond \u201cmere si-\nlence ,\u201d id.;  \n\u2022 the drivers never pleaded that GM knew of the starter defect, id.; \n\u2022 the drivers never pleaded that they relied on GM\u2019s alleged omission , id. at 9; \nand \n\u2022 some of the drivers\u2019 claims are time -barred, id. at 10 .  \nThe first four fail ; the last succeeds in part . \nA. The drivers plausibly plead ed that GM had a duty to disclose  \nGM says that it had no duty to disclose the starter defect. But each state\u2019s law \nsays otherwise . 5 In Maryland, \u201c vehicle manufacturers [must]  report vehicle or equipment defects. \u201d \nDoll v. Ford Motor Co. , 814 F. Supp.  2d 526, 537 (D. Md. 2011) ; see Md. Code Ann. , \nCom. L aw \u00a7 13-301(9) .  \nGM fares no better under California law. In California , it had a duty to disclose if  \nit had \u201c exclusive knowledge of material facts not known or reasonably accessible to \nthe plaintiff[s]. \u201d Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto Superstores Cal. , 248 Cal. Rptr. 3d 61, 84 \n(Ct. App. 2018).  The drivers plead that GM knew about the starter defect.  And the \nstarter defect is material since it plausibly poses safety concerns. Plus,  knowledge of  \nthe starter defect is not \u201creasonably accessible\u201d to drivers. Id. How many could know \nabout solenoids, pinion gears, electromagnets, and heat shields?   \nGeorgi a and Pennsylvania law s mirror California\u2019s , so the drivers \u2019 claims survive \nthere too. McCabe v. Daimler AG , 948 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1368 (N.D. Ga. 2013) ; Zwier-\ncan v. GMC , 58 Pa. D. & C. 4th 251,  259 (Phila. Ct. Com. Pl . Sept. 11, 2002) .  \nAnd Florida law reaches the same conclusion.  In Florida, a manufacturer may not  \n\u201cknowingly fail [] to disclose a material defect that diminishes a product \u2019s value. \u201d Mat-\nthews v. Am. Honda Motor Co. , 2012 WL 2520675, at * 3 (S.D. Fla. June 6, 2012) . As \nI rule below, the drive rs plausibly pleaded that GM knew about the starter defect. \nThat defect is material because it concerns the Camaro\u2019s safety. And a car that  strug-\ngles (and sometimes fails) to start is worth less than one that does not . Id.  \nSo this line of attack fails . 6 B. The drivers need not plead acts beyond mere silence to state con-\nsumer protection claims  \nGM says a \u201cdeceptive omission \u201d requires  \u201ca cover -up or affirmative act that is more \nthan mere silence.\u201d  D.I. 24, at 6  (internal quotation mark s omitted ). Yet many  states \nrequire only omission. Where more is required, the drivers have pleaded enough.   \nMaryland law forbids mere  \u201comission  of any material fact.\u201d Md. Code Ann. , Com. \nLaw \u00a7 13-301(9)  (emphasis added) ; accord  Singh v. Lenovo ( United States ) Inc. , 510 \nF. Supp. 3d 310 , 326\u201327 (D. Md. 2021) .  \nLikewise, in Georgia , Florida , and Pennsylvania  mere nondisclosure is enough . \nSee, e.g. , McCabe v. Daimler AG , 948 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1368 (N.D. Ga. 2013) ; Gavron \nv. Weather Shield Mfg. , 819 F. Supp. 2d 1297, 1302 (S.D. Fla. 2011) ; In re Passarelli \nFamily Tr. , 242 A.3d 1257, 1270 (Pa. 2020).  \nThe California drivers also survive GM\u2019s challenge. In California, fraud by omis-\nsion requires concealment.  The drivers  can show that by alleging that GM  replaced  \none defective part with another. Mui Ho  v. Toyota Motor Corp. , 931 F. Supp. 2d 987, \n998\u201399 (N.D. Cal. 2013). They  plead exactly that  D.I. 22  \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 148 \u2013152. They need \nnot plead more to proceed.  \nAgain, GM fails to knock out any claim.  \nC. The drivers plausibly allege that GM knew of the starter defect  \nGM argues that nothing in the complaint \u201cestablish[es] \u2026 knowledge of a defect.\u201d \nD.I. 24, at 7. But the drivers need not establish  that GM knew about the starter de-\nfect. Instead, they need only plausibl y plead  that\u2014and they do. The drivers allege \nthat GM knew about the starter defect from:  7 \u2022 the results of GM\u2019s rigorous preproduction tests, id. \u00b6\u00b6 135\u2013139; \n\u2022 complaints on third- party websites, which GM says it monitors, id. \u00b6 133 & n.7; \n\u2022 consumer complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  \nid. \u00b6\u00b6 126\u201328; \n\u2022 dealership reports related to the starter defect, id. \u00b6\u00b6 140\u201342; \n\u2022 and the demand for replacement parts related to the starter defe ct, id. \u00b6\u00b6 132, \n143. \nPlus, the drivers note that some dealers admitted awareness of the starter defect. \nId. \u00b6 143. Indeed , they say the problem is so prevalent that GM drafted a document \nteach ing mechanics how to replace \u201cfaulty\u201d starters. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 77, 131 . Taken together, \nthese factual assertions plausibly plead knowledge .   \nD. The drivers  plausibly  plead that they relied on GM\u2019s omissions  \nIn some states, the drivers must allege that they relied on an  omission to state a \nconsumer -protection claim . See, e.g. , Lloyd v. GMC , 916 A.2d 257, 277  (Md. 2007) . \nGM says that the drivers have failed to do that. I disagree . The drivers  swear  that \nthey would have paid less for the Camaro (or not bought  it) had they known of the \nstarter defect.  D.I. 22  \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18, 28, 39, 52, 64, 74, 85, 145, 230, 245, 440.  That is \nreasonable:  cars that start are worth more than cars that do not.  \nPlus,  the drivers all cla im to have studiously researched the Camaro before buying \nit. So if GM had disclosed the starter defect, they would have known about it. \u00b6\u00b6  13, \n17, 27, 38, 51, 63, 73,  156, 180, 183, 230, 304, 312, 438, 440.  Thus, where required,  \nthey have properly pleaded reliance.  8 E. Some of the consumer -protection claims are time -barred  \nGM launches one last salvo against the drivers\u2019 consumer -protection claims.  It \nargues that  some drivers took too long to sue . This time, GM hits some of its targets.  \nIn Florida, plaintiffs have four years to bring their claims. Fla. Stat. \u00a7  95.11(3)(f) . \nThe Loadholtes es, two Florida residents, bought their Camaro  in June 2016. D.I. 22 \n\u00b6 61. But the y joined this suit  only in December 2020, six months past the deadline . \nAnd Florida l aw does not stop the filing clock simply because a consumer took a while \nto discover  the violation.  Licul v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am. , 2013 WL 6328734, at * 6 \n(S.D. Fla. Dec. 5, 2013) . True, the deadline is extended by fraudulent concealment . \nBut the concealm ent must involve  more than  \u201cmere non -disclosure.\u201d Id. Instead, such  \nfraud must be active. Id.  Here, the dealer made  ineffective repairs. D.I. 22 \u00b6  67\u201368. \nBut that is not  active fraud.  So I will dismiss the Loadholtes es\u2019 consumer -protection \nclaims.  \nGM tries the same tactic  to defeat California driver Previti \u2019s claim . But it fails. \nTrue, the filing clock starts ticking when the car is sold. Herremans v. BMW of N. \nAm., LLC , 2014 WL 5017843, * 3\u22124 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2014). But California  recognizes  \nan exception: the delayed discovery rule . Under this rule, \u201cthe statute of limitations \nbegins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused \nby wrongdoing.\u201d Stella v. Asset Mgmt. Consultants, Inc. , 213 Cal. Rptr. 3d 850 , 858 \n(Cal. Ct. App. 2017).  \nThat rule applies to both California statutes here . Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Sol s., Inc. , \n292 P.3d 871,  878 (Cal. 2013) ; Asghari v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am. , 42 F. Supp. 3d \n1306,  1320 ( C.D. Cal. 2013) . To be sure, Previti  says that he first learned about  an 9 issue in 2016, six months after buying the car. But when he took the car  to a local \nChev rolet  dealership, the \u201cservice advisor told him there was nothing wrong\u201d with it. \nD.I. 22 \u00b6 \u00b6 40\u201341. Only in March 2019 , did the dealership diagnose the defect . Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 42\u201344. So his earliest reasonable discovery date was a few months before he joined \nthis lawsuit,  well within the shorter of California\u2019s two statutory  deadline s. Compare \nCal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1783 with Cal. Bus. & Prof . Code \u00a7 17208.  \nThus, Previti\u2019s claim survives, b ut I dismiss the Loadholtes es\u2019 with prejudice .  \nIII. SOME EXPRESS -WARRANTY CLAIMS SURVIVE  \nThe drivers say that their cars were covered by one of two warranties: GM\u2019s  new-\nvehicle limited warranty or  its certified preowned vehicle warranty.  Both provide that \nGM will repair the Camaros if the cars break down during a certain time. The drivers \nsay that GM breached those warranties because it never solved the starter defect; \ninstead , it replaced faulty  starters with equally  faulty  parts.   \nGM counters  with several  legal arguments . It notes  that some warranties were \nexpired. It argues that some of the drivers\u2019 claim s fail because dealerships, not GM , \nsold the relevant Camaros. It also  says that a few  drivers voided their warranties by \nusing non- GM parts to fix the starter defect. Last , GM argues it satisfied its warranty \nobligations by offering to repair the drivers\u2019 cars.  \nA. Some  express  warranties had expired by the time the starter defect \nappeared  \nGM says that many of the drivers\u2019 warranties had expired by the time they sought  \nrepairs. This argument knocks out four  drivers .  10 The Loadholtes es\u2019 starter broke nine months after their warranty expired. D.I. \n\u00b6\u00b6 61, 65. Harris\u2019s warranty coverage ended a mon th before h e sought repairs . Id. \n\u00b6 75. Both  respond that the warranty is  unconscionable. Id. \u00b6 329. I disagree. If the \ndrivers wanted more coverage,  they could have bought extended warrant ies. But they \ndid not. Extending their standard warranty would give them a retroactive rebate. So \nI dismiss their express -warranty claims  with prejudice.  \nA fourth  driver, Miller, also fails to show that her car was under warranty. Her \nstarter began to fail two  and a half years after she bought the car . But she never  says \nhow many miles her Camaro had at that point. She  could have exceeded the 36,000 -\nmile coverage limit. So I will also dismiss  Miller\u2019s express -warranty claim . But I do \nso without prejudice. If Miller wants, she can amend the complaint and add details \nto show that her car was still under warranty.  \nTwo other drivers , Franzen and Seale , survive GM\u2019s  timing challenges . Franzen  \nbought a  certified preowned Camaro with 33,088 miles. Id. \u00b6 25. The car came with a \nwarranty that expired after one year or 12,000 miles. Id . Franzen experienced the \nstarter defect eleven months, but 18,000 miles later.  Id. \u00b6 29. Normally, warranties \nsay that coverage ends after one year or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first . If that \nis true, Franzen\u2019s claim crumble s. But for now , I must take Franzen at her word. And \nshe says that the warranty was good for  at least  one year. Id. \u00b6 25. So I will not dis-\nmiss her  express -warranty  claim yet.  \nSeale says  his car was warrantied for two years and 19,000 miles. Id. \u00b6 49. But six  \nmonths after he bought it , he experienced the starter defect. Id. \u00b6 53. GM notes that  11 Seale never pleaded the mileage at which his car began to exhibit the starter defect. \nBut that omission is not fatal . Reading his claim in the light most favorable to Se ale, \nhe probably did not drive  19,000 miles in six months . So I will not dismiss Seale\u2019s \nclaim either . \nB. GM\u2019s other express -warranty arguments fail  \nGM\u2019s next round of attack s fails. All the remaining express -warranty claims sur-\nvive.   \nStart with Seale. GM says that  his claim fail s for lack of privity : Seale bought his \nCamaro from a dealership, not GM , so he cannot sue it.  That is wrong.  \nSeale\u2019s warranty applies  \u201cto the original and any subsequent owners of the vehicle \nduring the warrant y period.\u201d D.I. 22 \u00b6 108. Under Florida law, when  (as here) a man-\nufacturer voluntarily extends a warranty to remote purchasers,  it cannot \u201cresurrect \n[the] common law requirement of privity.\u201d Fischetti v. Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc. , 918 So. \n2d 974, 976 ( Fla. D. Ct. App. 2005). To be sure, some dicta cut  the other way. Weiss \nv. Johansen , 898 So. 2d 1009, 1012  (Fla. D. Ct. App. 2005). But later cases  seem to \nrequire privity only in implied -warranty cases . See Ocana v. Ford Motor Co. , 992 So. \n2d 319 , 325  (Fla. D. Ct. App. 2008)  (citing Weiss) .  \nAnd I predict that the Supreme Court of Florida would not require privity for  ex-\npress -warranty claims. Presumably , consumers pay more for products backed by \nmanufacturer warranties. It  would be unfair  to let them pay a premium only to later \nfind that the warranty is void because they, like everyone else, bought their car at a \ndealership.  Seale paid more for the warranty. The law should honor his bargain , so I \nwill not dismiss his claim for lack of privity.   12 GM has two more cards up its sleeve . First, it says some drivers voided their war-\nranties by having third -party mechanics repair the starter defect with non -GM parts.  \nTrue, GM\u2019s warranty does not cover \u201ccomponents that are damaged \u2026 by \u2026 non -GM \npart[s].\u201d D.I.  15-2, at 24. But the drivers never say that  non-GM parts harmed their \nGM ones . Rather, they  say that because of the starter defect they had to buy  expen-\nsive non-GM parts. Plus, some drivers  got those non -GM parts only after GM refused \nto repair their  cars under the warranty. D.I. 22 \u00b6 29\u201332. So these drivers\u2019 claims can \nproceed.  \nSecond, GM says that it complied with the warranty\u2019s terms by trying to repair \nsome of the drivers\u2019 cars. But the drivers say those repairs failed to cu re the defect . \nAnd since GM promised \u201c to correct  any vehicle defect ,\u201d it breached the warranty by \nmaking \u201cunsuccessful repair[s].\u201d D.I. 22  \u00b6 108 (emphasis added);  see Hines v. Mer-\ncedez -Benz USA, LLC , 358 F. Supp. 2d 1222, 1229  (N.D. Ga. 2005)  (holding that  un-\nsuccessful repairs can breach a warranty ). So GM\u2019s defense misses the mark.   \nIV. I DISMISS THE MAGNUSON -MOSS WARRANTY ACT CLAIMS  \nThe drivers also sue GM under the Magnuson -Moss Warranty Act, which sets \nrules for selling goods with written warranties. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301 \u201312. If the author of \nthe warranty  (the warrantor ) breaks those rules, buyers can sue him. Id. \u00a7 2310(d)(1).  \nGM argue s that I lack jurisdiction to hear these claims. It says that the drivers \nmay bring Magnuson -Moss claims in a federal class action only if they name at least \n100 plaintiffs. Id. \u00a7 2310(d)(3)(C). But, stresses GM, the drivers could muster only \neight. S o their claim is not \u201ccognizable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2310(d)(3) . 13 The drivers counter that the 100 -plaintiff requirement applies only to suits \n\u201cbrought under\u201d Magnuson- Moss. Id. \u00a7 2310(d)( 3). They say  they are doing no such \nthing. Rather, insist the drivers, they rely on the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) \nfor jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1332(d)(2). And CAFA lacks a 100- plaintiff requirement.  \nThe parties present a tricky issue \u2014one that has split two c ircuit courts and count-\nless federal district courts. Compare Floyd v. Am. Honda Motor Co. , 966 F.3d 1027, \n1033\u2013 35 (9th Cir. 2020), with  Kuns v. Ford Motor Co. , 543 F. App\u2019x 572, 573 \u201374 (6th \nCir. 2013). Be that as it may, I am confident  that GM has the better argum ent. \nStart with Magnuson- Moss\u2019s text. It says buyers can sue warrantors in federal \ndistrict court \u201csubject to\u201d paragraph (3). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  2310(d)(1), (d)(1)(B). \u201cSubject to\u201d  \nmeans \u201conly if.\u201d See Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gartner, Reading Law  126 (2012). \nThus, the Act lets  drivers sue  in federal court , but only if they comply with paragraph \n(3). \nSo, what must one do  to comply with paragraph (3)? The answer, alas , is not ob-\nvious. Again, we look to the text. Paragraph (3) says \u201cno claim shall be cognizable\u201d  in \nfederal court  if: \n\u2022 A class action is \u201cbrought under\u201d paragraph (1)(B) of Magnuson -Moss , and  \n\u2022 \u201c[T]he number of named plaintiffs is less than one hundred. \u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7  2310(d)(3), (d)(3)(C).  A claim is not  \u201ccognizabl e\u201d if courts lack jurisdiction \nto hear it.  Cognizable  (def. 3), Black\u2019s Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 201 9); see also John \nR. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 136 (2008) ( noting that \u201c cog-\nnizable by \u201d means \u201cabout the same thing \u201d as \u201chas jurisdiction \u201d). No one disputes that 14 this case has fewer than 100 named plaintiffs. So I may not take cognizance of  this \ncase\u2014I lack jurisdiction to hear it \u2014if it is \u201cbrought under\u201d paragraph (1)(B) of Mag-\nnuson- Moss. Id. \u00a7 2310(d)(3).  \nWhat does it mean to bring a suit und er a law? Again, the answer is not obvious . \nBut first some critical distinctions.  Not all laws are the same. Some, like a law pro-\nhibiting murder, impose substantive duties on people , so we call them \u201csubstantive\u201d \nprovisions. Others  let people sue those who violate substantive provisions. In legal-\nese, they provide \u201ccauses of action.\u201d Still other s let courts hear certain cases. They \ngrant \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  \nWith those distinctions in mind, turn back to the question: what does it mean for  \nsomeone to bring an action under a certain law?  There are two possibilities. \u201cBrought \nunder law X\u201d could mean \u201c relying on X for a cause of action .\u201d This is GM\u2019s preferred \nreading. The drivers press  a different meaning. \u201cBrought under law X,\u201d they say, \nmeans \u201crelying on law X for jurisdiction .\u201d Though the drivers\u2019 reading is  plausible, \nGM\u2019s is better.  \nLitigants do the bringing of suits. So the \u201cbrought under\u201d language in Magnuson-\nMoss is addressed to litigants, not courts. That suggests that it supplies a c ause of \naction. Ca uses of action  address themselves to litigants ; jurisdictional provisions ad-\ndress themselves to courts . Compare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  1983 (authorizing \u201cthe party injured\u201d \nto bring \u201can action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress\u201d), with \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1331 (\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions \narising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d) . Supporting 15 this reading , paragraph (1) of Magnuson -Moss speaks of \u201cconsumers who \u2026 may \nbring suit,\u201d not courts that may hear cases. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  2310(d)(1).  \nPlus, federal statutes routinely use \u201cbrought under\u201d as shorthand for \u201c relying on \nX for a cause of action .\u201d See, e.g., Chris v. Tenet, 221 F.3d 648, 651 \u221253 (4th Cir. 2000). \nFor instance, one provides that  \u201cUnited States district court[s] \u2026 shall have jurisdic-\ntion of actions brought under this title.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e -5(f)(3). If the drivers were \nright, the statute would read, \u201cUnited States district court[s] \u2026 shall have jurisdic-\ntions of actions relying on this title for jurisdiction.\u201d That is a tautology. Congress \nmay sometimes be less than crystal clear, but it is not in the business of enacting \nvacuous truisms. See also  15 U.S.C. \u00a7  2619(a)  (similar); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7  6110( j)(1)(B), (2) \n(same); 30 U .S.C. \u00a7 1427(a) (same); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1515(a) , 1910(c)  (same); 42 U .S.C.  \n\u00a7 9124(a) (same).   \nSo \u201cbrought under\u201d means \u201c relying on X for a cause of action .\u201d On this reading, \nGM wins. The drivers rely on Magnuson -Moss for a cause of action. They cannot rely \non CAFA fo r a cause of action because that law gives only jurisdiction . 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(d).  They bring their suits under paragraph (1)(B) of the Act . Yet they do not \nname 100 plaintiffs as required. So their claim is not cognizable. I dismiss it without \nprejudice. The drivers can add ninety -two other plaintiffs if they wish.   \nV. MOST OF THE DRIVERS \u2019 IMPLIED -WARRANTY CLAIMS FAIL \nSay a shop sells you a com puter. You open it only to find that it will not start. You \ntake it back to get a replacement. Without an express warranty, you can do that be-\ncause  the shop  implicitly promised that the computer was fit for ordinary compu-\nting\u2014browsing  the internet , word processing, and so on. The implicit promise is an 16 \u201cimplied warranty of merchantability and fit ness.\u201d  So too here. GM  impliedly prom-\nised that the Camaros would  be fit for driving .  \nThe drivers allege that GM breached that implied warranty by selling cars that  \nstruggle  (and sometimes fail) to start. But  many  of these  claims fail.  \nStart with Franzen and Previti, the California drivers . To recover, they first had  \nto give GM several chances  to fix their cars. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7  1793.2(d) (1) (permitting \nrecovery on warranty claims only after a  \u201ca reasonable number of [repair] attempts \u201d); \nArakelian v. Mercedes- Benz USA, LLC , 2018 WL 6422649 , at *3 (C.D. Cal. June 4, \n2018) . And they had  to do so within a year of buying their Camaros . Cal. Civ. Co de \n\u00a7 1791.1(c) .  \nPreviti brought his Camaro to a GM dealership only once during the implied- war-\nranty period. So I dismiss his claims with prejudice. Franzen says that her starter \ndefect showed up  a month before the implied warranty ran out . D.I. 22 \u00b6  29. But she \nnever says when she took it to GM\u2019s dealership for a repair. If she waited a month, \nher warranty would have expired . And even if she did not, GM might have had only \none chance to fix her car . Her complaint rules out neither of these potentially fat al \nflaws. So I will dismiss her claims without prejudice.  \nNext , consider the Florida  and Georgia  drivers. Both Florida and Georgia  recog-\nnize implied warranties only when the litigants were in privity  with the manufac-\nturer. Ocana v. Ford Motor Co. , 992 So. 2d 319, 325 ( Fla. D. Ct. App. 2008) ; Monticello \nv. Winnebago Indus. , 369 F. Supp. 2d 1350, 1361 (N.D. Ga. 2005) . But here, there was 17 no privity  with GM : the Loadholtes es, Seale, and Harris  each bought their cars from \ndealerships, not GM. D.I. 22 \u00b6\u00b6  49, 61, 71. I dismiss their claims with prejudice .  \nMiller\u2019s claim also misses the mark . In Pennsylvania, a car is generally merchant-\nable (and fit for its ordinary purpose) when it provides \u201csafe\u201d and \u201creliable\u201d transpor-\ntation and is \u201csubstantially free of defect s.\u201d Solarz v. Daimler Chrysler Corp. , 2002 \nWL 452218 , at * 8 (Mar. 13, 2002)  (quoting Skelton v. General Motors Corp., 500 F.  \nSupp. 1181, 1192 (N.D.  Ill. 1980) ). True, Miller\u2019s car was  unreliable  when it failed to \nstart and stalled . D.I. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 86\u201392. But th at happened after her express  warranty had \nexpired.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 88, 108.  And the express warranty provided that any implied war-\nranty would expire at the same time.  Id. \u00b6 108; see Nationwide Ins. Co. v. General \nMotors Corp. , 625 A.2d 1172, 1178 (Pa. 1993) (upholding the validity of such a limi-\ntation). So Miller had no implied warranty when  the car became unsafe and unrelia-\nble. Thus, I dismiss her claims with prejudice.   \nThat leaves Talley.  His car failed to  start within the warranty period. D.I. 22 \n\u00b6\u00b6 15, 19. A car that cannot move is not fit for its ordinary purpose: transportation. \nGM counters that Talley  did not plead that the defect existed at the time of sale , as \nrequired by Maryland law . D.I. 24 , at 14 ; see also Cricken berger v. Hyundai Motor \nAm., 944 A.2d 1136, 1143 (Md. Ct. App. 2008) . Again, it ignores the complaint. Talley \nsays that the previous generation of Camaros (2010 \u20132015) exhibited the starter de-\nfect. D.I. 22 \u00b6  116. Yet, argues Talley,  GM never redesigned the heat shield . Instead, \nit installed the same defective shield in his car. Id.  Plus, the drivers  allege that GM\u2019s \nown testing showed that its starter would fail prematurely. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 134\u201339. Since 18 Talley plausibly pleads that the defect ex isted when he bought the Camaro, his claim \nmay proceed.  \nVI. MOST OF THE DRIVERS \u2019 UNJUST -ENRICHMENT CLAIMS FAIL \nThe drivers claim that GM unjustly enriched itself at their expense. Florida, Geor-\ngia, and Pennsylvania law preclude this claim . Maryland and California law do not. \nSo some claims may proceed.   \nStart with Florida. There, u njust enrichment is available only when there is no \n\u201cadequate remedy  \u2026at law.\u201d  Williams v. Bear Stearns Co. , 725 So.2d 397, 400 (Ct. \nApp. Fl. 1998).  But the Florida drivers do have remedies  at law: they allege an ex-\npress contract (the warranty) and do not suggest that contract -based remedies are \ninadequate. Cf. Teshakovec v. Ford Motor Co ., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116130 , at *44 \n(S.D. Fla. July 12, 2018) . Plus, they have a consumer protection claim for the same \nalleged facts . See Lewis v. Mercedes- Benz United States , 530 F. Supp. 3d 1183, 1233  \n(S.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2021) . So these claims are dismissed with prejudice .  \nGeorgia and Pennsylvania also bar the unjust -enrichment claims here . Georgia  \ndoes not let  a plaintiff \u201cplead an unjust  enrichment claim in the alternative to a claim\u201d \nfor breach of an express warranty . Callen v. Daimler Ag , 2020 WL 10090879, at  *13 \n(N.D. Ga. June 17, 2020) . Pennsylvania has a similar rule. Sabol v. Ford Motor Co. , \n2015 WL 4378504, at * 5 (E.D. Pa. July 16, 2015). Yet the drivers from those states, \nHarris and Miller, plead both express warranty and unjust enrichment. So I dismiss \ntheir unjust -enrichment claims with prejudice .  \nBut the Maryland and California drivers\u2019 claims survive. GM asserts that Mary-\nland driver Talley cannot maintain his claim because (1) Talley and GM are not in 19 privity and (2) there is an express contract (the warranty) on point. D.I. 24 , at 18. \nBoth arguments fail. Maryland does not require privity or the absence  of a contract \nwhen a plaintiff pleads fraud. See, e.g. , Singh v. Lenovo ( United States) Inc. , 510 F.  \nSupp.  3d 310, 328\u2013 29 (D. Md. 2021) ; Cty. Comm\u2019rs of Caroline Cty. v. J. Roland \nDashiell & Sons, Inc. , 747 A.2d 600, 608 \u2013609 (Md. Ct. App. 2000). Because Talley \npleads fraud here, his claims may proceed.  \nSo may the claims of the California drivers. True, California does not allow \nstandalone unjust -enrichment claims. See Astiana v. Hain Celestial Grp., Inc. ,783 \nF.3d 753, 762  (9th Cir. 2015). But such claims may be \u201cconstrue[d] \u2026 as a quasi -\ncontract claim se eking restitution.\u201d Id.  at 762. The drivers\u2019 claims could succeed in \nthat form: several recent California courts have  allowed such  claims against car ma k-\ners on similar facts . See, e.g. , In re Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Fuel Tank Litig ., 2021 WL \n1338949, at * 35 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2021).  So Franzen and Previti\u2019s   claims may con-\ntinue.  \nVII. GM\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE  \nThe drivers bring their claims on behalf of Camaro owners all across America. \nAlternatively, they bring their claims on behalf of Camaro owners  from their sta tes. \nGM seeks to strike all the se class allegations. Fed . R. Civ. P. 12(f), 23(c)(1)(A),  \n23(d)(1)(D);  D.I. 26 , at 8. They say the drivers cannot show that \u201cquestions of law or \nfact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only indi-\nvidual members .\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) ; D.I. 26 , at 9.   \nGenerally, motions to strike before discovery are disfavored. See, e.g., Martin v. \nFord Motor Co. , 765 F. Supp. 2d 673, 680\u2013 81 (E.D. Pa. 2011)  (collecting cases) . They  20 are appropriate only when \u201c no amount of discovery will demonstrate that the class \ncan be maintained.\u201d Goode v. LexisNexis Risk & Info. Analytics Grp., Inc. , 284 F.R.D. \n238, 245  (E.D.  Pa. 2012) . That is true only for the nationwide class\u2019s claim of  unjust \nenrichment.  So I strike only  that.  \nA. I will strike the  nationwide class \u2019s allegations of unjust enrichment  \nGM wants me to strike the nationwide class\u2019s claims for Magnuson -Moss viola-\ntions and unjust enrichment . Because I am dismissing the Magnuson -Moss claims, \nthat request is moot.   \nBut I will strike the nationwide class\u2019s unjust -enrichment claim. T he drivers never \nsay which state\u2019s unjust -enrichment law applies. So I must look to Delaware law. \nKlaxon Co. v. S tentor Elec. Mfg. Co. , 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941)  (choice -of-law rules of \nthe forum state apply .). And under Delaware law , I would have to apply the unjust -\nenrichment laws of fifty states  because  GM sold allegedly defective Camaros in every \nstate . Phoenix Ca nada Oil Co. v. Texaco Inc. , 560 F. Supp. 1372, 138 2\u201383 (D. Del. \n1983) . Those  laws vary widely. Compare Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co. , 666 F.3d \n581, 591 (9th Cir. 2012) , with Vulcan Golf, LLC v. Google Inc. , 254 F.R.D. 521, 532 \n(N.D. Ill. 2008) . Common issues of law could not possibly predominate. See Yarger v. \nING Bank, FSB , 285 F.R.D. 308, 325 (D. Del. 2012)  (rejecting predominance when \nthis Court had  to apply the laws of sixteen states) . So I will grant GM\u2019s  motion to \nstrike this claim. To be clear, the drivers who survived the motion to dismiss can still \nbring their unjust -enrichment claims , they just cannot do so on behalf of a nationwide \nclass . 21 B. I will not strike any other claim  \nGM does not show that any other  class\u2019s consumer -protection and warranty claims \nfail the predominance requirement. So I will deny those motions to strike.  \nFirst, GM argues that  the drivers have not shown how prevalent the starter defect \nis among all Camaro owners . D.I. 26 , at 11. True. But discovery might reveal that  the \nstarter defect is universal. So I will not strike any claim on this ground.  \nSecond,  GM contends that the drivers  have not shown how the starter defect low-\nered their cars \u2019 value . Id. at 13. But again, discovery might help . Experts could, for \ninstance, reveal a difference between the car\u2019s value with and without the defect.  So \nI will not strike the claims on this ground either.  \nThird, GM says common issues of fact do not predominate because different class \nmembers will have  treated their Camaros differently . Id. But it never explains how \nthis affects any of the drivers \u2019 claims. See Neale v. Volvo Cars of N. Am., LLC , 794 \nF.3d 353, 371 (3d Cir. 2015). Again,  I will not strike on this ground . \nFinally , GM charges that the  drivers lack standing to represent the owners of any \nmodel -year Camaro that they do not own. D.I. 26 , at 9. But a named plaintiff may \nrepresent a class whose members bought  different products. See Marcus v. BMW of \nN. Am., LLC , 687 F.3d 583, 598 (3d Cir. 2 012). And the drivers  have plausibly pleaded \nthat the starter defect afflicted all the putative class members\u2019 cars.  So I deny the \nmotion to strike these state law claims.  \n* * * * * \nClass actions  can be complex. This case is no exception. So I list the cla ims I dis-\nmiss or strike  for clarity .  22 I dismiss these  with prejudice: the Loadholteses\u2019 consumer -protection, express -\nwarranty, implied- warranty , and unjust -enrichment claims;  Seale\u2019s implied -war-\nranty and unjust -enrichment claims;  Previti\u2019s implied -warranty  claim ; Harri s\u2019 ex-\npress -warranty, implied -warranty, and unjust -enrichment claims;  and Miller\u2019s im-\nplied -warranty and unjust -enrichment claims.  \nI dismiss these  without prejudice:  Franzen\u2019s implied- warranty claims;  Miller\u2019s ex-\npress -warranty claims;  and the Magnuson- Moss  claims for every plaintiff.  \nFinally, I strike the nationwide class  allegations for  unjust  enrichment. All others \nlive to fight another day.   \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \n \n \nCHRIS  TALLEY,  MARIE  FRANZEN,  \nJESSICA  LOADHOLTES,  ROBERT  \nLOADHOLTES,  MARK  PREVITI,  LEE  \nANN  MILLER,  CORY  SEALE,  and  \nDAMION  HARRIS , individually and on \nbehalf of all other similarly situated  \n \nPlaintiffs , \n \nv. \n GENERAL\n MOTORS,  LLC, \n \nDefendant . \n No. 1:20-cv-1137-SB \n \n \n  ORDER  \n1.
