No. 21- 1593- RGA  \n       \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nPlaintiff  Corey Ferrell  (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) , a firefighter with the Wilmington Fire Department, \ncontends  that the City of Wilmington and certain of its employees discriminated against him on \nthe basis of his race and religion.  Pending before the Court is Defendants\u2019 mot ion to dismiss under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  (D.I. 11.)  For the reasons explained below, I \nrecommend that the motion be GRANTED- IN-PART  and D ENIED -IN-PART . \nI. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background  \nI will summarize  here the more  pertinent allegations  in the Amende d Compl aint.  The Court \nmust  treat the following allegations  as true for purposes of resolving Defendants\u2019 motion to \ndismiss.   Plaintiff identifies as \u201ca Muslim African American.\u201d  (D.I. 10 (\u201c Amend. Compl.\u201d)  \u00b6 17.)   \nDefendant Ci ty of Wilmington (the \u201cCity\u201d) hired Plaintiff as a firefi ghter in 1998, and he has held \nthat position ever since.  ( Id. \u00b6 18.)   2 \n \u201cFrom virtually the beginning of Plaintiff\u2019s employment\u201d with  the City, he has been \nsubjected to continuing harassment regarding his race and religion.  (Id. \u00b6 19.)   On multiple \noccasi ons, other firefighters called Plaintiff  \u201cblack motherfucker,\u201d \u201cblack bastard,\u201d and \u201cyou \npeople .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 25.)  A superior officer \u201creferred to Plaintiff as \u2018 boy\u2019 and told Plaintiff, \u2018get away \nfrom me boy.\u2019\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 24.)  And, on at least two occasions, su periors  referred  to Plaintiff  or \nsomeone else as a \u201cn*****r\u201d  in Plaintiff\u2019s presence.   (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 28.)   Plaintiff reporte d the incidents \nto his superiors , but the Caucasian perpetrators were not disciplined.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30.)   \nPlaintiff\u2019s coworkers also made fun of his religion \u201c[o]n an almost everyday basis.\u201d ( Id. \n\u00b6 31.)  When Plaintiff prayed, other firefighters would say things like, \u201ct here goes ali baba on his \nmagic carpet .\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 32.)  They also played the Aladdin1 theme song \u201cwhenever\u201d Plaintiff w ent \nto pray.  ( Id. \u00b6 33.)  On one occasion, Plaintiff\u2019s coworkers poured pork grease into his  coffee cup, \nknowing that Plaintiff\u2019s religious beli efs prohibited him from consuming pork products.  ( Id. \u00b6 34.)  \nPlaintiff reported the incident but no one was disciplined.  ( Id. \u00b6 35.)  \nOn November 23, 2017, Plaintiff\u2019s wife brought a turducken to the station for the \nfirefighters.  One of Plaintiff\u2019s superiors told Plaintiff, \u201cI did not think you shama -lama -ding- dong \nMuslims celebrated Thanksgiving.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 36.)   And, on July 6, 2021, Plaintiff found an unopened \ncan of p ork sandwich meat in his uniform pocket  and learned that a coworker had placed it there.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 37 \u201338.)  Plaintiff reported the incident to a superior , but the perpetrator was not disciplined.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 40 \u201341.)   \nSometime in  June 2018, Captain Reece  told Plaintiff to move his truck because it was too \nclose to a fire hydrant .  (Id. \u00b6 43.)  Plaintiff thought Reece was wrong , and  Plaintiff told another  \nsuperior that he was being treated unfairly .  (Id. \u00b6 44.)  \u201c Shortly thereafter, \u201d Plaintiff overhea rd \n \n1 Aladdin is a n animated film based on an Arabic folktale.   \n 3 \n Reese telling a different superior,  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn to do your damn job and make Corey \nmove that truck.\u201d  ( Id. \u00b6 45.)  When the superior  responded that Plaintiff\u2019s  truck was lawfully \nparked, R eese replied, \u201cI do not care, make him move it.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 46.)  On June 27, 2018, Plaintiff  \nwas suspended for 45 days without pay in connection with the incident.  ( Id. \u00b6 47.)   A Caucasian \nsuperior officer was charged with similar violations but was not dis ciplined as harshly.  ( Id. \u00b6 56.)  \nIn a separ ate incident, another Caucasian firefighter received a one- day suspension after he \n\u201cassaulted and offensively touched a mentally disabled man while on duty.\u201d   (Id. \u00b6 57.)   \nPlaintiff reported his harassment and unequal treatment t o the City\u2019s human resources \nand compliance representatives  on multiple occasions , including in June 2018, February 2019, \nand September 2019.  ( Id. \u00b6\u00b6 54\u201361.)  The City took \u201cno action\u201d in response to his complaints.  \n(Id. \u00b6 61.)  \nB. Procedu ral History  \nPlaintiff  filed two relevant Charges of Discrimination  with the Delaware Department of \nLabor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).  (D.I. 12, Ex. A , C.)  \nPlaintiff \u2019s first Charge of Discrimination is an  EEOC Form 5 filed  on January 15, 2019.   (Id., Ex. \nA (\u201cFirst Charge\u201d).)   Plaintiff checked off boxes on the form to indicate that he was alleging \ndiscrimination based on race, religion, and retaliation.  ( Id.)  Plaintiff indicated on the form that he \nwas subjected to the \u201c[a] dverse employment action\u201d of \u201charassment ,\u201d and he described the 2017 \nThanksgiving incident and the 2018 parking incident, for which he was suspended for 45 days \nwithout pay.  ( Id.)  In the box titled \u201c Date(s) Discrimination Took Place ,\u201d Plaintiff listed \u201c11 -23-\n2017\u201d under \u201cEarliest,\u201d and \u201c6- 27-2018\u201d under \u201cLatest \u201d; the checkbox labeled \u201cContinuing \nAction\u201d was not checked.  ( Id.)  Plaintiff received a Right to Sue letter from the EEOC on August \n13, 2021.  ( Amend. Compl . \u00b6 66 ; D.I. 1, Ex. B.)  4 \n Plaintiff filed his  original Complaint in this case on November 20, 2021.  On December \n28, 2021, Plaintiff filed his second Charge of Discrimination.  (D.I. 12, Ex. C (\u201cSecond Charge\u201d).)  \nThe Second Charge lists the factual allegations from  the First Charge  and others.   It describes the \n2021 pork product incident and it alleges that \u201cAfrican American and non -muslim [sic] employees \nare disciplined more and more severely than white employees.\u201d  ( Id.)  In the box titled \u201cDate(s) \nDiscrimination Took Place,\u201d Plaintiff listed \u201cNov ember 23, 2017\u201d under \u201cEarliest,\u201d and \u201cAugust \n8, 2021\u201d under \u201cLatest\u201d; this time, the \u201cContinuing Action\u201d box was checked.  ( Id.)  Plaintiff \nreceived a Right to Sue letter from the EEOC on March 11, 2022.   \nOn March 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed an Amended Com plaint in this case .  It contains four \ncounts .  Count I names the City and alleges race discrimination in violation of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, et seq.   Count II names the City and alleges religious \ndiscrimination in v iolation of Title VII.  Count III alleges race discrimination in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and names the City  and three individuals: Deputy Chief John Hoban \u201cin his \nindividual and official capacity,\u201d Fire Department Chief John Looney \u201cin his individual  and \nofficial capacity,\u201d and Battalion Chief Andre Cooper \u201cin his individual and official capacity\u201d  \n(collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d).   Count IV is styled \u201c42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u2013Hostile Work \nEnvironment,\u201d and it names the City and the I ndividual  Defendants .   \nDefendants moved to dismiss all four counts  for failure to state a claim.   The motion is \nfully briefed, and I held a hearing on December 2, 2022.  (D.I. 11\u201314; \u201cTr. __\u201d.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss  \nA defendant may move to dismiss a complaint under F ederal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain 5 \n sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  \nAshcroft v.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007)).  A claim is plausible on its face when the complaint contains \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is lia ble for t he misconduct \nalleged.\u201d  Id.  A possibility of relief is not enough.  Id.   \nIn determining the sufficiency of the complaint under the plausibility standard, the c ourt \nmust \u201cdisregard[] a pleading\u2019s legal conclusions,\u201d then \u201cassume all remaining fa ctual all egations \nto be true, construe those truths in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, and then draw all reasonable inferences from them.\u201d  Connelly v. Lane Const. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 790 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing Foglia v. Renal Ventures Mgmt., L LC, 754 F .3d 153, 154 n.1 (3d Cir. 2014)).  The \ninquiry is not \u201cwhether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail\u201d but instead only \u201cwhether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence to support his or her claims.\u201d  Grier v. Klem , 591 F.3d 672, 676 (3d \nCir. 2010).  \nB. Title  VII \n\u201cTitle VII contains administrative remedies and procedures that a litigant must exhaust \nprior to asserting a private cause of action under the Act.\u201d  Daoud v. City of Wilmington, 894 F. \nSupp. 2d 544, 552 (D. Del. 2012).   \nIn the context of an aggrieve d individual charging unlawful \nemployment practices by an employer, the administrative \nprocedures require the filing of a formal charge of discrimination with the EEOC within the required time.  In Delaware, a claimant filing a charge of discrimin ation under Title VII has 300 days from \nthe time of the alleged discriminatory act to file a complaint with the EEOC.  If the agency does not take action within a specified time period, it must notify the aggrieved individual, typically with a right -\nto-sue letter, after which the individual has 90 days to file a civil \naction.  Both the 300 -day limitation to file the charge of \ndiscrimination and the 90- day period for filing the court action are \ntreated as statutes of limitations.  6 \n  \nId. at 553 (citations and footnote omitted).    \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Count I  state s a claim of racial discrimination . \nCount I alleges that Plaintiff was subjected  to disparate treatment on account of his race.   \nIt alleges that , in 2018, Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action in the form of a  45-day \nsuspension for parking his truck too close to a fire hydrant , but firefighters  of a different race  \nreceived lesser pen alties for similar or worse infractions.   \nDefendants do  not dispute that Plaintiff has exhausted a disparate treatment claim based on \nhis 2018 suspension and that the claim was timely filed.  (Tr. 6.)  Defendants contend  that the \ndisparate treatment claim in Count I should nevertheless be dismissed because Plaintiff\u2019s proposed \ncomparators are not similarly situated.  For example, Defendants  point  out that two of the alleged \ncomparators are higher in rank than Plaintiff.  But Defendants  have not explained why that , or any  \nof the  other asserted  differences , is dispositive to the quest ion of whether the comparators are \nsimilarly situated .2   \nWhether an asserted  comparator is  similarly situated is generally a question of fact  and \nshould be decided on a complete record, not a motion to dismiss.  Monaco v. Am. Gen. Assur. Co., \n \n2 See, e.g., B oyer v. City of Philadelphia, No. 13- 6495, 2015 WL 9260007, at *6 (E.D. Pa. \nDec. 17, 2015) (\u201cDefendants provide no explanation of why rank is relevant to discipline.  Unless \nthe Police Department\u2019s disciplinary  policy provides that police officers, like plaintiff, are \npunished differently than captains or lieutenants for the same conduct, their positions are irrelevant to disciplinary treatment and they may be considered comparators.\u201d); Chan v. C ty of Lancast er, \nNo. 10- 3424, 2013 WL 2412168, at *17 (E.D. Pa. June 4, 2013) (\u201cImportantly, defendants have \nnot suggested . . . that the County\u2019s ethics policy which they contend plaintiff violated, differs \nfrom the ethics policy applicable to [the putative comparators] or any other County employee.\u201d) ; \nsee also  Rodgers v. White , 657 F.3d 511, 518 (7th Cir. 2011) (\u201c[W]hen a plaintiff and his \nsupervisor were accused of making similar mistakes, were equally responsible for avoiding those mistakes, and were dis ciplined by the same superior, the plaintiff can make a realistic comparison \nwith his supervisor for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.\u201d) .\n \n 7 \n 359 F.3d 296, 305 (3d Cir. 2004)  (explaining that the determination of  \u201cwho might qualify as a \nsimilarly situated employee\u201d is \u201ca fact- intensive inquiry on a case- by-case basis\u201d).   Accordingly, \nI recommend that the Court deny Defendants\u2019 request to dismiss Count I.3 \nB. Count II states a claim of religious discrimination.  \nCount II alleges that Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment on account of \nhis religion.  Defendants say that Count II should be dismissed because the incidents alleged in the \nAmended Complaint are unexhausted and/or  untimely .  I disagree.  \n \n3 Defendants contend that the alleg ations set forth in Count I are insufficient to state a claim \nof racial discrimination under a hostile work environment theory.  However, as set forth above, \nPlaintiff has  sufficiently pleaded at least one viable theory of racial discrimination  so Count I will \nbe moving forward, regardless of the sufficiency of Plaintiff\u2019s hostile work environment allegations.   \nI recommend that the Court decline  at this stage to preclude Plaintiff from pursuing a \nhostile work environment theory under Title VII .  Defendants \u2019 argument, essentially, is that the \n2018 suspension is a \u201cdiscrete act\u201d that cannot be aggregated with the earlier alleged incidents  for \npurposes of establishing a single hostile work environment practice , and that the earlier incidents \nare untim ely.  Judge Andrews expressed skepticism about a  similar argument in Hantz v. Div . of \nState Police, Dep \u2019t of Safety & Homeland Sec., No. 21- 801-RGA, 2022 WL 1523064, at *3 n.1 \n(D. Del. May 13, 2022), and rightly so.  Regardless, the allegations in the Amen ded Complaint \u2014\nviewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff \u2014are enough to plausibly suggest that he was \nsubjected to  harassment based on race that extend ed into the 300- day limitations period.  ( See, e.g., \nAmend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6  21, 25, 27, 30, 61, 62 ; Tr. 25 \u201329.)   See Mandel v. M & Q Packaging Corp., \n706 F.3d 157, 165 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201cUnder the continuing violation doctrine, discriminatory acts that are not individually actionable may be aggregated to make out a hostile work environment claim; such acts \u2018 can occur at any time so long as they are linked in a pattern of actions which \ncontinues into the applicable limitations period .\u2019\u201d (quoting O\u2019Connor v. City of Newark , 440 F.3d \n125, 127 (3d Cir. 2006)) ).  And I agree with Plaintiff tha t he has plausibly al leged a hostile work \nenvironment that falls within the scope of  his EEOC charges .  (D.I. 12, Ex. A  (Charge of \nDiscrimination with box checked for \u201crace\u201d and stating  that the \u201c[a]dverse employment  action\u201d \nwas \u201charassment \u201d), Ex. C (boxes for \u201crace\u201d and \u201c Continuing A ction \u201d checked ).)   \nI also note that , because I conclude below that Plaintiff can move forward on his religious \nhostile work environment claim,  the temporal scope of discovery will be the same regardless o f \nwhether the Court knocks out Plaintiff\u2019s r acial hostile work environment claim at this stage.  Of \ncourse, Defendants are free to pursue evidence in support of their arguments and raise them at  the \nsummary judgment  stage of the case, as appropriate.  The effect of any temporal interruptions in a \npattern of hostility can be assessed at that time.  8 \n Plaintiff has alleged a timely claim of hostile work environment  based on religion.  As  the \nSupreme Court has concisely explained,  \n[a] hostile work environment claim is composed of a series of \nseparate acts that collectively constitute one \u201cunlawful employment  \npractice.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u20135(e)(1).  The timely filing provision \nonly requires that a Title VII plaintiff file a charge within a certain \nnumber of days after the unlawful practice happened.  It does not \nmatter, for purposes of the statute, that some of  the component acts \nof the hostile work environment fall outside the statutory time period.  Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within \nthe filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability . \n \nNat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 117 (2002) ; Mandel v. M & Q Packaging \nCorp., 706 F.3d 157, 165 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c Under the continuing violation doctrine, discriminatory \nacts that are not individual ly actionable may be aggregated to make out a hostile work environment \nclaim; such acts \u2018 can occur at any time so long as they are linked in a pattern of actions which \ncontinues into the applicable limitations period .\u2019\u201d (quoting O\u2019Connor v. City of Newark , 440 F.3d \n125, 127 (3d Cir. 2006)) .  \u201cTo alleg e a continuing violation, the plaintiff must show that all acts \nwhich constitute the claim are part of the same unlawful employment practice and that at least one \nact falls within the applicable limitations period.\u201d  Mandel , 706 F.3d at 165\u201366.  \nHere, Plai ntiff has alleged an incident within the limitations period: the July 6, 2021 \nincident in which another firefighter put a can of pork in Plaintiff\u2019s coat, knowing that Plaintiff\u2019s \nreligion forbids  him from eating pork.  ( Amend. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 37 \u201339.)  Pla intiff further alleges  that, \nnotwithstanding his complaints to the City, his coworkers made derogatory comments relating to his religion \u201c on an almost everyday basis.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 31.)   He also alleges a number of o ther incidents \nthat plausibly suggest a pat tern of derogatory comments and actions by Plaintiff \u2019s colleagues  and \nsuperiors regarding Plaintiff\u2019s religion.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 31 \u201334.)   And , he alleges that he reported the 9 \n misconduct to multiple supervisors and human re sources personnel on multiple occasions, but no \naction was taken.   In sum, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged a pattern with at least one act in the \nlimitation s period, so I can\u2019t say at this stage that his claim is untimely.  \nDefendants point out \u2014and Plaintiff  doesn\u2019t dispute \u2014that a break of longer than 300 days \nbetween incidents will preclude Plaintiff from relying on the earlier incidents to demonstrate a \nhostile work environment.  (Tr. 25.)  But the effect of any temporal interruptions in a pattern of hostil ity will have to be assessed o n a more complete record , not on a motion to dismiss.  At this \npoint, the Court must accept as true Plaintiff\u2019s a llegation that he was subject to comments about \nhis religion \u201c on an almost everyday  basis .\u201d  (Amend. Compl. \u00b6 31.)  \nI also reject Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to exhaust a hostile work \nenvironment claim based on religion.  \u201cThe relevant test in determining whether a plaintiff has \nexhausted his administrative remedies is \u2018whether the acts alleged in the s ubsequent Title VII suit \nare fairly within the scope of the prior EEOC complaint, or the investigation arising therefrom.\u2019\u201d   \nNavarro v. Wal -Mart Assocs., Inc., No. 19- 201-LPS, 2020 WL 777202, at *3 (D. Del. Feb. 18, \n2020)  (citation omitted) .  Plaintiff\u2019s First Charge checked  the \u201creligion\u201d box and alleged that the  \nconduct being challenged was \u201charassment.\u201d  (D.I. 12, Ex. A .)  Cf. Anjelino v. N.Y. Times Co. , 200 \nF.3d 73, 95 (3d Cir. 1999)  (concluding that the  phrase \u201cabusive environment\u201d in an EEOC charge \nwas sufficient to exh aust the plaintiff\u2019s hostile work environment claim ).  It also lists  the 2017 \nThanksgiving incident and a lleges that  a superior told Plaintiff, \u201cI did not think you sham a lam a \nMuslim ding dongs celebrated Thanksgiving.\u201d  (D.I. 12, Ex. A.)  Plaintiff\u2019s Second Charge \ncontains the same allegations and also describes the 2021 incident in which Plaintiff found pork in his coat pocket.  ( Id., Ex. C.)  It likewise alleges \u201charassment \u201d based on \u201creligion,\u201d  and the \n\u201cContinuing Action \u201d box is checked.  The acts and hostil e work environment alleged in the 10 \n Amended Complaint  are fairly within the scope of Plaintiff\u2019s EEOC charges  and the investigation \nthat could be expected to arise from those charges .   \n Accordingly, I recommend that the Court deny Defendants\u2019 request to dis miss Count II.  \nC. Count III should be dismissed.  \nCount III of the A mended Complaint  asserts a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against all \nDefendants.  Plaintiff  agrees  that this count may be dismissed  (D.I. 13  at 1), so I recommend that \nthe Court dismiss it.    \nD. Count IV should be dismissed.  \nIn Count IV of the A mended Complaint , Plaintiff  alleges that he was subjected to a hostile \nwork environment in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  Plaintiff\u2019s counsel agreed during the hearing \nthat dismissal of Count IV is appropriate as against the Individual Defendants in their individual \ncapaci ties.  (Tr. 33 \u201334.)    \nWhat\u2019s left of Count IV is Plaintiff\u2019s claim against the City and the Individual Defendants \nin their official capacities.  Plaintiff agrees that Count IV cannot go forward unless Plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury was caused by a policy, practice, or custom attributable to the C ity.  (Tr. 34.)  McTernan v. \nCity of York , 564 F.3d 636, 658 (3d Cir. 2009)  (citing  Monell v. Dep \u2019t of Soc. Servs . N.Y.C., 436 \nU.S. 658 (1978) ); Bielevicz v. Dubinon , 915 F.2d 845, 849\u201350 (3d Cir. 1990).  To survive a motion \nto dismiss, the Amended C omplaint  must allege (among other things)  facts supporting both a \nplausible inference that there wa s a policy or custom that caused P laintiff \u2019s injury and a plausible \ninference that the C ity was th e deliberate, \u201c moving force \u201d behind it.  Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of \nBryan Cnty . v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997) ; Earl v. Harris , No. 22- 1026- RGA, 2022 WL \n17475482, at *8 (D. Del. Dec. 6, 2022) . 11 Plaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint doesn\u2019t  contain facts plau sibly  suggesting that the City was \nthe moving force behi nd any policy or custom  that caused  him to be subject to a hostile work \nenvironment.  Accordingly, Count IV should be dismissed.   \nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn light of the con clusions stated above, I  need not address the remaining arguments.
