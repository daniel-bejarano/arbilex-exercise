(D.I. 5, 12). Plaintiff opposes Defendants\u2019 motion. (DI. 16). Both\nDefendants oppose Plaintiffs motion. (D.I. 15). I have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefing. (D.I. 6, 12,\n15, 16, 18).\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff Doehler North America Inc. (\u201cDNA\u201d) filed suit against Defendants Russell Lee\nDavis and Crosskeys Associates Limited (\u201c\u201cCKAL\u201d) seeking injunctive relief and damages under\nthe Agreement Among Initial Members of Doehler Dry Ingredients Solutions, LLC (\u201cMember\nAgreement\u201d) and the Operating Agreement of Doehler Dry Ingredients Solutions, LLC\n(\u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) (D.L. 2 at 14-17, D.I. 2-1). This action concerns membership units of\n\nDoehler Dry Ingredients Solutions, LLC (\u201cDDIS\u201d),' a company involved in the freeze-dried fruit\n\n! Plaintiff and Defendants do not agree on the name of DDIS. Compare D.I. 2 at \u00a7 2; D.I. 2-1,\nEx. A-1 at 1, D.L. 5 at 1, with D.I. 2-1, Ex. B at 1 et passim; D.I. 12 at 1; D.I. 15-1, Ex. A at 1.\nThe Court adopts Plaintiff's style: Doehler Dry Ingredients Solutions, LLC.\n\n1\n\nand vegetable business. (D.I. 2 at \u00a7 17). DDIS, DNA, Davis, CKAL, and others entered into the\nOperating Agreement \u201cto set out fully their respective rights, obligations and duties regarding\u201d\nDDIS. (D.I. 2-1, Ex. B at 1). DNA, Davis, CKAL, and others entered into the Member\nAgreement to provide for the \u201cstart-up and early and middle-stage management and processes of\nand for\u201d DDIS. (D.I. 2 at ] 20; 2-1, Ex. A-1 at 1). Plaintiff's copies of these Agreements indicate\nthat they occurred on the same day, November 1, 2017, and that the Member Agreement was\namended on November 15, 2017. (D.I. 2-1, Ex. A-1 at 1; Ex. A-2 at 1; Ex. B at 1). Defendants\ndispute the dating of the Member Agreement. (D.I. 15 at 12).\n\nOn January 26, 2022, DNA delivered notice to CKAL that it wished to exercise its right\nto purchase CKAL\u2019s units of DDIS \u2014 totaling twenty-five percent of the total units of DDIS \u2014\nunder the cross-transfer purchase provisions of the Membership Agreement. (D.I. 2 at {J 27-28).\nOn February 15, CKAL responded that it would not comply with this request. (D.L. 2 at \u00a7 32). On\nMarch 25, Davis sent email communications directing recipients to contact Davis and others at\nexternal email addresses, claiming that his and two other email accounts \u201chave been\ncompromised.\u201d (D.I. 2 at | 42). The parties dispute the factual circumstances of these\ncommunications. (D.I. 2 at J] 41-49; D.I. 15 at 14-15). Plaintiff sent Davis a cease-and-desist\nnotice on March 29, and Davis refused to comply by written response on April 6. (D.L. 2 at {ff\n47-48). This action was filed on April 20. (D.I. 2).\n\nPlaintiff's motion requests that the Court enjoin Davis from interfering with the relations\nor arrangements of DNA or DDIS and from using email addresses established by Davis for\nDDIS business. (D.I. 5 at 1-2). Defendants\u2019 motion requests that the Court stay proceedings in\nthis case until the resolution of litigation pending before the Delaware Court of Chancery. (D.I.\n\n12 at 1). The action before the Court of Chancery, styled Jn re: Dissolution of Doehler Dry\n\nIngredient Solutions, LLC, Del. Ch. C.A. No. 2022-0354, was filed on April 21, 2022, the day\nafter this action was filed. (See D.I. 12 at 1-2). In that action, Defendants petition the Court of\nChancery to dissolve DDIS and to grant permission to wind up its affairs. (D.I. 12 at 2).\nIL. ORIGINAL JURISDICTION\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(2), this Court has original jurisdiction over civil actions if (a)\ncomplete diversity of citizenship exists between the parties and (b) the amount in controversy\nexceeds $75,000. Complete diversity does not exist \u201cif any plaintiff and any defendant are\ncitizens of the same state.\u201d Mennen Co. y. Atl. Mut. Ins. Co., 147 F.3d 287, 290 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(citing Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806)). Here, no party disputes that the amount in\ncontroversy requirement is satisfied. However, Defendants point out that DDIS is a limited\nliability company formed in Delaware and that DNA is a Delaware corporation. (D.I. 15 at 2-3;\nDL. 2 at | 5, 18). Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to join an indispensable party, DDIS,\nand that once DDIS is joined as a defendant, this Court will lose its diversity jurisdiction over the\ncase because DDIS and DNA are not diverse parties.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 provides a two-step analysis for determining whether\na party must be joined to a case. The Court must first determine whether DDIS is \u201ca so-called\n\u2018necessary\u2019 party who must be joined under Rule 19(a) if joinder is feasible.\u201d Janney\nMontgomery Scott, Inc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc., 11 F.3d 399, 404 (3d Cir. 1993). Rule 19(a) states,\nin relevant part:\n\nA person . . . shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person\u2019s absence\n\ncomplete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims\n\nan interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the\n\naction in the person\u2019s absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person\u2019s\n\nability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a\n\nsubstantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by\nreason of the claimed interest.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). If the Court determines that DDIS is a necessary party, then it must\ndetermine whether DDIS is an \u201cindispensable party\u201d under Rule 19(b). If the Court determines\nthat DDIS is not a necessary party, DDIS need not be joined. See Kuhn Constr. Co. v. Ocean &\nCoastal Consultants, Inc., 723 F. Supp. 2d 676, 686 (D. Del. 2010) (\u201c[I]f a party is not necessary\nunder Rule 19(a), the court need not conduct an analysis under Rule 19(b).\u201d).\n\nDefendants argue that DDIS is a necessary party because Plaintiff is seeking relief\n\u201cdirectly and derivatively on behalf of DDIS.\u201d (D.I. 15 at 6). Defendants point to Plaintiffs\nproposed Order, which reads in relevant part: \u201cThat Davis, and anyone associated with or acting\nin concert with Davis, be enjoined from interfering or attempt to interfere with the relations of\nDDIS, including with any person who is an employee, consultant, customer, client, vendor,\ndistributor, or supplier of DDIS[.]\u201d (D.L. 5-1 at \u00a7 1). But Defendants cite no authority and\nprovide no argument for the conclusion that a motion for injunctive relief involving DDIS makes\nDDIS a necessary party under Rule 19(a). Rule 19(a) requires complete relief for the parties\npresent, not for those absent from the suit. See Field v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 626 F.2d 293, 301\n(3d Cir. 1980) (complete relief \u201crefers to relief as between the persons already parties, not as\nbetween a party and the absent person whose joinder is sought, and mere theoretical\nconsiderations of disposing of the whole controversy should not be employed\u201d). \u201cThe effect a\ndecision may have on the absent party is not material\u201d to determining whether complete relief is\npossible without the absent party. Janney Montgomery Scott, 11 F.3d at 405. Nor have\nDefendants shown that resolving the present case would harm DDIS\u2019 interests or expose\nDefendants to inconsistent obligations. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants were obligated under the\n\nAgreements to sell Defendants\u2019 units of DDIS to Plaintiff. (D.I. 18 at 2). DDIS was not a party to\nthese agreements. For these reasons, I conclude that DDIS is not a necessary party under Rule\n19(a) and need not be joined.\n\nDefendants also fail to establish that Plaintiffs claims are derivative claims. Whether a\nclaim is direct or derivative depends on \u201c(1) who suffered the alleged harm (the corporation or\nthe suing stockholders, individually); and (2) who would receive the benefit of any recovery or\nother remedy (the corporation or the stockholders, individually).\u201d Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin &\nJenrette, Inc., 845 A.2d 1031, 1033 (Del. 2004). Here, Plaintiff seeks enforcement of an\nagreement between Plaintiff and Defendants. (D.I. 18 at 4). Defendants have not argued that the\nComplaint alleges that DDIS suffered the harms giving rise to the breach of contract claims. Nor\nhave Defendants argued that Plaintiffs proposed relief would benefit DDIS. Consequently,\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims are all direct claims for relief, and DDIS need not be joined as a defendant in\nthis case.\n\nBecause DDIS is not a necessary party and Plaintiff's action is a direct action, diversity\njurisdiction exists.\n\nIll. MOTION TO STAY\n\nDefendants move to stay proceedings in this case until the resolution of the case before\nthe Court of Chancery. (D.I. 12 at 1).\n\nCourts have discretion to stay the proceedings of a case.\u201d Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S.\n248, 252 (1936); Cost Bros., Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 760 F.2d 58, 60 (3d Cir. 1985). In\nexercising this discretion, courts consider three factors: \u201c(1) whether a stay will unduly prejudice\nor present a clear tactical disadvantage to the non-moving party, i.e., the balance of harms; (2)\n\nwhether a stay will simplify the issues in question and trial of the case; and (3) whether a stay\n\n? Neither party raises abstention issues in connection with the motion for a stay.\n\n5\n\nwill promote judicial economy, e.g., how close to trial has the litigation advanced.\u201d Husqvarna\nAB v. Toro Co., 2016 WL 5213904, at 3* (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2016) (citing Cheyney State Coll.\nFac. v. Hufstedler, 703 F.2d 732, 737-38 (3d Cir. 1983)).\n\nFirst, Defendants assert that a stay will not unduly prejudice Plaintiff because the stay\nwould only last until the end of the dissolution proceeding in the Court of Chancery. (D.L. 12 at\n4). But Defendants ignore several tactical advantages that they would enjoy if this Court granted\na stay until then. As Plaintiff observes, granting the stay would allow the later-filed action in the\nCourt of Chancery to take precedence over this first-filed case. (D.I. 16 at 12). If the Court of\nChancery were to dissolve DDIS, then this Court would not be able to award specific\nperformance, that is, compel Defendants to transfer their units of DDIS to Plaintiff. Because\nthese key effects of granting a stay benefit Defendants and disadvantage Plaintiff, this first factor\nweighs against granting the motion to stay.\n\nSecond, Defendants emphasize the ability of a stay to simplify litigation. (D.I. 12 at 3).\nThey assert that if the Court of Chancery dissolves DDIS, then Plaintiff\u2019s claims against\nDefendants will become moot or be resolved during that proceeding. /d. Plaintiff argues that the\ndissolution proceeding will not resolve Plaintiff's claims for breach of the Member or Operating\nAgreements. (D.I. 16 at 4). The Court finds that a stay of this proceeding is unlikely to simplify\nthe issues surrounding Defendants\u2019 obligations to Plaintiff under the Member and Operating\nAgreements. As Plaintiff notes (D.I. 16 at 14), denying the motion to stay may simplify the\ndissolution proceeding by ensuring that Defendants have standing to bring that suit given their\nobligations under the Member and Operating Agreements. Resolving Plaintiff\u2019s breach of\ncontract claims could substantially simplify the dissolution proceeding, but the reverse is less\n\nlikely. The second factor does not weigh in favor of granting the motion to stay.\nThird, Defendants assert that considerations of judicial economy \u201cstrongly\u201d weigh in\nfavor of a stay because the case was just filed and briefing was not due at the time of submission.\n(D.I. 12 at 4). But because both sides have already briefed the TRO motion, this point fails to\nsupport granting the motion to stay.\n\nConsideration of these three factors does not justify granting Defendants\u2019 motion to stay.\nConsequently, the Court will deny the motion to stay proceedings.\n\nIV. MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nPlaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order barring Defendants from\ninterfering with the activities of DDIS or DNA. (D.I. 5). Defendants were given notice and an\nopportunity to respond, and this motion was briefed by both sides. (D.I. 15, 18). The Court will\nthus apply the legal standards for preliminary injunctions to adjudicate the motion.\n\nA. Legal Standard\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 governs the issuance of preliminary injunctions. A\npreliminary injunction is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d to be granted \u201conly in limited\ncircumstances.\u201d Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer\nPharms. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 586 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Instant Air Freight Co. v. CF. Air\nFreight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797, 800 (3d Cir. 1989)). The purpose of a preliminary injunction is \u201cto\npreserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held\u201d in order to\n\u201callow a victory by [the plaintiffs] to be meaningful.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390,\n395 (1981). \u201cThe decision whether to enter a preliminary injunction is committed to the sound\ndiscretion of the trial court.\u201d Duraco Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters., Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1437\n(3d Cir. 1994) (quoting Merchant & Evans, Inc. v. Roosevelt Bldg. Prods. Co., 963 F.2d 628,\n\n633 (3d Cir. 1992)),. When seeking a preliminary injunction, the movant must show: \u201c(1) a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is\ndenied; (3) that granting preliminary relief will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving\nparty; and (4) that the public interest favors such relief.\u201d Child Evangelism Fellowship of N.J.\nIne. v. Stafford Twp. Sch. Dist., 386 F.3d 514, 524 (3d Cir. 2004); see Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555\nU.S. 7, 20 (2008). The \u201cfailure to establish any element. . . renders a preliminary injunction\ninappropriate.\u201d NutraSweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enters., Inc., 176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nIn order to meet the irreparable harm requirement, Plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate potential\nharm which cannot be redressed by a legal or an equitable remedy following trial. The\npreliminary injunction must be the only way of protecting the plaintiff from harm.\u201d Jnstant Air\nFreight, 882 F.2d at 801. \u201c[T]he injury must be of a peculiar nature, so that compensation in\nmoney cannot atone for it.\u201d Morton v. Beyer, 822 F.2d 364, 372 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nPlaintiff argues that reputational harm and loss of goodwill due to Davis\u2019 emails suffice\nto show irreparable harm. (D.1. 6 at 15-16). Plaintiff alleges that Davis falsely reported a data\nbreach to DDIS, which in turn caused reputational damage to DNA. (D.I. 6 at 16). Plaintiff also\nalleges that management of DDIS will be hindered unless Defendants are enjoined from using\nemail addresses \u201csolely controlled by Davis or CKAL.\u201d (D.L. 6 at 16). Plaintiff alleges that Davis\nrefused to cease and desist from rerouting emails to an external account. (D.I. 2 at 47-48).\n\nAs an initial matter, Plaintiff attempts to show irreparable harm to DNA by showing that\nDDIS would suffer irreparable harm. But as the Court held above, DNA has not asserted\nderivative claims on behalf of DDIS. Plaintiff has not provided any evidence linking the\nreputation of DNA to the reputation of DDIS. Plaintiff asserts that \u201cDDIS will be unable to\n\neffectively communicate with its employees\u201d without a preliminary injunction. (D.L 6 at 16), But\n\nto the extent that DNA is claiming that DNA is harmed as a result of being a member of DDIS, it\nis reciting a derivative claim. See Feldman v. Cutaia, 951 A.2d 727, 733 (Del. 2008) (\u201cThe mere\nfact that the alleged harm is ultimately suffered by . . . the stockholders does not make a claim\ndirect under Tooley. In order to state a direct claim, the plaintiff must have suffered some\nindividualized harm not suffered by all of the stockholders at large.\u201d).\n\nEven if evidence of a link between DNA\u2019s reputation and DDIS\u2019 reputation were\nproffered, Plaintiffs evidence of reputational harm to DDIS is thin. As its primary support,\nPlaintiff claims that \u201cDNA has suffered reputational harm from the false claim of a DDIS data\nbreach\u201d because \u201csuppliers, clients, and key stakeholders believe that DDIS\u2019s email servers have\nbeen compromised.\u201d (D.I. 6 at 16). But Plaintiff does not explain why a single email from Davis\nalleging that three email accounts \u201chave been compromised\u201d (D.I. 2 at \u00a7 42) would harm DDIS\nat all, much less irreparably. Moreover, Defendants claim that at least one other member of\nDDIS, Garry Beckett, was under the impression that Davis\u2019s email was indeed hacked. (D.I. 15\nat 14). Plaintiff does not address this claim in either of its replies. (D.I. 16, 18). The Court is thus\nleft with an email reporting three compromised email accounts to clients, and remarks from\nanother member supporting those reports. This is not enough to show reputational harm to DDIS,\nmuch less to DNA.\n\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show that it will undergo\nirreparable harm without a preliminary injunction. Because the irreparable harm element is\ndispositive for this motion, the Court need not consider the other elements. The motion for a\n\ntemporary restraining order will be denied.\n\nVv. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (D.I. 5) is\n\nDENIED, and Defendants\u2019 Motion to Stay Litigation (D.I. 12) is DENIED.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED this /\u00a7 day of July 2022.\n\n(4 bohm \u2014\nUnited ae District Judge\n\n10\n"}
