Connolly", "date": "11-07-2022", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELA WARE \nTTI CONSUMER POWER \nTOOLS, INC., TECHTRONIC \nPOWER TOOLS TECHNOLOGY \nLIMITED, and TECHTRONIC \nCORDLESS GP, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. Civil Action No. 22-673-CFC \nLOWE'S HOME CENTERS LLC, \nDefendant. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nDefendant Lowe's Home Centers LLC filed a request for ex parte \nreexamination of all 13 claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,837,451 (the #451 patent). \nD.I. 13-1, Ex. A. Three weeks later, the United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice {PTO) granted the request. D.I. 13-2, Ex. B. Six weeks after the PTO \ngranted the request-and nine weeks after the request was filed-Plaintiffs TTI \nConsumer Power Tools, Inc., Techtronic Power Tools Technology Limited, and \nTechtronic Cordless GP (collectively TTi) filed this suit. D.I. 1. Pending before \nme is Lowe's Home Centers LLC's Motion to Stay Pending Ex Parte \nReexamination of U.S. Patent No. 10,837,451. D.I. 11. TTi opposes the motion. Deciding whether to stay litigation is a matter left to the Court's discretion. \nSee Ethicon, Inc. v. Quigg, 849 F .2d 1422, 1426-27 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In exercising \nthis discretion, the Court must weigh the competing interests of the parties and \nattempt to maintain an even balance. See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254-\n55 (1936). Courts typically consider three factors in deciding whether to exercise \nthis discretion: ( 1) whether a stay will simplify the issues and trial of the case, (2) \nwhether discovery is complete, and a trial date has been set, and (3) whether a stay \nwould unduly prejudice or present a clear tactical disadvantage to the non-moving \nparty. See, e.g., Kaavo Inc. v. Cognizant Tech. Sols. Corp., 2015 WL 1737476, at \n* 1 (D. Del. Apr. 9, 2015); Enhanced Sec. Rsch., LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 2010 WL \n2573925, at *3 (D. Del. June 25, 2010). Additionally, when deciding whether to \nstay a case pending covered business method ( CBM) review proceedings, courts \nconsider \"whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will reduce the burden of litigation \non the parties and on the court.\" Brit. Telecomms. PLC v. IAC/InterActiveCorp., \n2019 WL 4740156, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 27, 2019). \"While Congress's four-factor \ntest for granting stays in the CBM context does not expressly extend to other types \nof post-grant proceedings, such as ex parte reexaminations, courts have found that \nthe policy considerations governing the issuance of stays are similar with respect to \nall post-grant proceedings. For that reason, the Federal Circuit and various district \ncourts have held that courts may weigh the fourth factor set forth in the CBM \n2 statute when considering staying cases that are co-pending with other types of \npost-grant proceedings.\" TC Tech. LLC v. Sprint Corp., 2021 WL 4521045, at *2 \n(D. Del. Oct. 4, 2021). \nAll four factors weigh in favor of staying this case. First, a stay will almost \ncertainly simplify the issues in this case. The PTO is reexamining all 13 claims in \nthe only patent that is asserted. \"[F]ollowing reexamination, roughly 80 percent of \nthe reexamined claims are either canceled or amended.\" TC Tech., 2021 WL \n4521045, at *6. So, the ex parte reexamination is highly likely to result in at least \nsome cancelled or modified claims. In fact, the PTO has already issued a non-final \noffice action rejecting all 13 claims. D.I. 13-5, Ex. E. This office action increases \nthe likelihood that at least some claims will be cancelled or modified. \"If all or \nsome of the asserted claims are cancelled, this litigation would be simplified\" or \nmooted entirely. Cooper Notification, Inc. v. Twitter, Inc., 2010 WL 51493 51, at \n*3 (D. Del. Dec. 13, 2010). \"If all or some of the asserted claims are modified, this \ncould render much of the parties' and Court's resources wasted-if, for instance, \nthe Court construes claim terms that are subsequently eliminated by amendment in \nthe reexamination.\" Id. So, granting a stay is highly likely to simplify the case and \nto conserve the parties' and the Court's resources. \nSecond, this case is in its early stages. When the parties submitted their \nbriefing for this motion, discovery had not started, and a trial date was not set. \n3 Since then, the Court has issued a scheduling order (D.1. 27), and the trial date is \napproximately two years away. If any discovery has occurred, it is minimal. In \nshort, this litigation's most burdensome parts have yet to occur. TTi does not \ncontest that this litigation is in its infancy. It merely claims that this litigation is \nonly in its infancy because the parties initially attempted to resolve this dispute \nwithout resorting to litigation. But explaining why this litigation is in its infancy \ndoes not change the fact that this litigation is in its infancy. Granting a stay at this \nearly stage will advance judicial efficiency and maximize the likelihood that \nneither the Court nor the parties expend their resources addressing invalid claims. \nThird, a stay will neither unduly prejudice nor provide a clear tactical \ndisadvantage to TTi. \"Courts are reluctant to stay proceedings where the parties \nare direct competitors.\" Cooper, 2010 WL 5149351, at *5. But Lowe's and TTi \nare not direct competitors. Lowe's sells its alleged infringing product to \nconsumers; TTi sells to Home Depot. Lowe's and Home Depot are direct \ncompetitors, but Lowe's and TTi are not. Absent direct competition, a stay is not \nlikely to unduly prejudice TTi. Further, any prejudice is minimized because TTi \n\"would be entitled to compensation for past infringement if the Court grants a stay \nand the [#451] patent survives reexamination.\" Id. at *4. \nTTi alleges that staying this case \"would provide Lowe's an unfair tactical \nadvantage by allowing it to capitalize on TTi' s good faith pre-suit efforts to resolve \n4 the infringement.\" D.I. 17 at 19. But it appears that both parties negotiated in \ngood faith before this suit was filed. During the negotiations, Lowe's told TTi that \n\"[Lowe's's supplier of the accused product] is in possession of evidence that can \ninvalidate the [#451 patent] in a reexamination proceeding.\" D.I. 18-6, Ex.Fat 7. \nAfter the negotiations proved fruitless, Lowe's filed the request for reexamination \nand, several weeks later, TTi filed this case. If anything, Lowe's was fully \ntransparent about its intentions and neither party gained a tactical advantage from \nthese negotiations. \nFourth, for the reasons discussed above in the first and second factors, \nstaying the case pending ex parte reexamination will reduce the burdens on the \nCourt. \nTTi also contends that \"staying this proceeding when Lowe's made the \nstrategic decision to file an EPR as opposed to an IPR conflicts with Congress's \nintent in creating IPR proceedings of definite duration.\" D .I. 1 7 at 20. Lowe's \ndoes not address this argument. But Congress provided for both an ex parte \nreexamination procedure and an inter partes review procedure. I therefore do not \nsee how Lowe's' s choice to file a request for an ex parte reexamination-a \nprocedure Congress created---conflicts with congressional intent. \nNOW THEREFORE, at Wilmington this Seventh day of November in 2022, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this case is STAYED pending ex parte \n5 reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 10,837,451. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that \nthe parties shall jointly file a status report every ninety days, beginning ninety days \nafter the date this Order is entered. \n{!_ \nciWi=UDGE \n6 "}
