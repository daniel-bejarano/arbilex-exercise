(D.I. 1) Pending before the court are two motions: (1)\nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s final\ndecision denying Plaintiff's claim for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the\nSocial Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433, (D.I. 11); and (2) the Commissioner\u2019s\nmotion for remand to the Social Security Administration for further proceedings pursuant to the\nfourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), (D.I. 13).? Plaintiff opposes the Commissioner\u2019s motion\nfor remand for further proceedings and argues that the court should instead remand the case for a\nfinding of disability and an award of benefits. (D.I. 15) For the reasons set forth below, the\n\nCommissioner\u2019s motion for remand is DENIED, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is\n\n' On August 2, 2022, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned judicial officer\nto conduct all proceedings in this matter through final judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).\n\n(DI. 10)\n2 The briefing on the pending motion for remand is found at D.I. 14 and D.I. 15.\nGRANTED insofar as Plaintiff seeks the entry of judgment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) reversing\nthe Commissioner\u2019s final decision and ordering the payment of benefits.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff filed an application for DIB on April 30, 2014, alleging disability as of February\n4, 2010. (D.I. 8 at21) An ALJ held a hearing on April 25, 2017, and subsequently issued an\nunfavorable decision on June 22, 2017, finding that Plaintiff could perform a reduced range of\nlight work even though she had severe impairments which included degenerative disc disease of\nthe lumbar spine, degenerative joint disease, obesity, and thoracic outlet syndrome. (Jd. at 21-\n27) After the Appeals Council denied her request for review, Plaintiff appealed the decision to\nthis court. (Jd. at 10-14)\n\nOn August 8, 2019, the court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanded the case for\nfurther administrative proceedings. (D.I. 8-1 at 590-627) In reaching this conclusion, the court\nfound that the ALJ erred in his assessment of the medical opinion evidence by assigning little\nweight to the opinions of three treating physicians: Dr. Tuerff, Dr. Devotta, and Dr. Bose. (/d. at\n620-25) The court determined that the treatment records the ALJ relied on to discount those\nopinions were not inconsistent with the medical opinions. (/d.) Because the treating physician\nopinions established greater limitations than those set forth in the ALJ\u2019s residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) determination, the court rejected that determination. (Jd. at 626) The court\nfurther found that the ALJ erred in his finding that Plaintiff could perform light work based on\nthe opinions of the state agency consultants because those consultants opined that Plaintiff could\nperform sedentary work. (Jd. at 625)\n\nOn remand, another hearing was held and the ALJ again issued an unfavorable decision\n\nin April of 2020 based on a finding that Plaintiff could perform a reduced range of sedentary\nwork. (D.I. 8-1 at 457-71) After the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review,\nPlaintiff again appealed the decision to this court. The Commissioner filed an uncontested\nmotion to remand the case for further consideration of the medical opinion evidence and\nPlaintiff's RFC, and to obtain supplemental testimony from a vocational expert. (D.L. 8-2 at 32-\n33) The court granted the uncontested motion to remand on March 18, 2021. (Jd. at 28)\n\nOn August 15, 2021, the Appeals Council entered an order effectuating the remand,\nconcluding that the ALJ had not complied with the court\u2019s 2019 order and setting forth specific\ninstructions requiring the ALJ to further consider the medical opinion evidence, Plaintiff's RFC,\nand supplemental vocational evidence. (D.I. 8-2 at 40-42) The ALJ held a hearing in January of\n2022 and denied Plaintiff's claim yet again in March of 2022, finding that Plaintiff could\nperform a reduced range of sedentary work at step 5 of the sequential analysis. (D.I. 8-1 at 1002-\n13)\n\nFor the third time, Plaintiff has appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision. (D.I. 1) For the second\ntime, the Commissioner has responded to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with a\nmotion for remand, conceding that the ALJ erred in considering Plaintiff's claim. (D.I. 14) The\ncourt must now decide whether to remand for further administrative proceedings pursuant to the\nfourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), or whether a finding of disability and an order for\npayment of benefits is appropriate at this juncture.\n\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nSection 405(g) defines the role of the court in reviewing Social Security disability\ndeterminations, providing that \u201c[t]he court shall have the power to enter, upon the pleadings and\ntranscript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the\n\nCommissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). \u201cOftentimes the remedy prescribed by the court is the relief sought . . . by the\nCommissioner: a remand for further proceedings. Such relief is specifically authorized by\nstatute, and given the deference owed to administrative agency decisions, is often appropriate.\u201d\nDiaz v. Berryhill, 388 F. Supp. 3d 382, 390 (M.D. Pa. 2019). But the statute also provides that\nthe court may direct the Commissioner to award benefits instead of remanding for further\nproceedings. See Brownawell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. , 554 F.3d 352, 357-58 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nA decision regarding the proper form of relief under \u00a7 405(g) is within the discretion of\nthe court. See Podedworny v. Harris, 745 F.2d 210, 221 (3d Cir. 1984). An order directing the\nagency to award benefits is appropriate only if two conditions are met: (1) \u201cthere has been an\nexcessive delay in the litigation of the claim which is not attributable to the claimant;\u201d and (2)\n\u201cthe administrative record of the case has been fully developed and substantial evidence on the\nrecord as a whole indicates that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits.\u201d Diaz, 388 F.\nSupp. 3d at 391. If both conditions are met, \u201cit is unreasonable for a court to give the ALJ\nanother opportunity to consider new evidence concerning the disability because the\nadministrative proceeding would result only in further delay in the receipt of benefits.\u201d\nPodedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22.\n\nUnder the first prong of the analysis, \u201ccourts measure th[e] delay both in terms of the\npassage of years and by reference to whether there have been prior appeals and remands.\u201d Diaz,\n388 F. Supp. 3d at 391. Generally, courts have found that administrative delays of five years or\nmore in cases involving one or two prior remands constitute excessive delays warranting an\naward of benefits. See id. (citing Brownawell, 554 F.3d at 358 (awarding benefits in case\n\ninvolving eight-year delay and two prior remands); Morales v. Apfel, 225 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir.\n2000) (awarding benefits in case involving ten-year delay and two appeals); Podedworny, 745\nF.2d at 223 (awarding benefits after more than five years of proceedings and two appeals)).\n\nThe second prong is satisfied when the record is fully developed and substantial evidence\non the record supports a conclusion that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits. Diaz,\n388 F. Supp. 3d at 391-92 (citing Gilliland v. Heckler, 786 F.2d 178, 184 (3d Cir. 1986)). In\ncircumstances where \u201cthe record before the agency does not support the agency action, [ ] the\nagency has not considered all relevant factors, or [ ] the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate\nthe challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare\ncircumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d Fla.\nPower & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). However, an award of benefits is\nproper when an \u201cextensive medical record, wrongly rejected by the ALJ, is substantial evidence\u201d\nthat a claimant is disabled, Morales, 225 F.3d at 320, or when treatment records and medical\nopinions over an extended period support a conclusion that the claimant cannot maintain a\nnormal, regular work schedule, Nance v. Barnhart, 194 F. Supp. 2d 302, 322 (D. Del. 2002).\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Delay\n\nThe parties do not meaningfully dispute Plaintiff's satisfaction of the first condition\nregarding excessive delay which is not attributable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff's disability application\nwas filed more than eight years ago and was subject to three hearings before an ALJ and three\nappeals to the district court. (D.I. 8 at 21-27; D.I. 8-1 at 457-71, 590-627, 1002-13; D.L. 8-2 at\n40-42; D.I. 14) The delays are therefore excessive both in terms of the overall duration and the\nnumber of instances in which the court has been charged with remanding flawed ALJ decisions.\n\nSee Diaz, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 393 (\u201c[I]f we acceded to the Commissioner\u2019s suggestion and\nremanded this case we would be setting the stage for an extraordinary, fourth administrative\ndecision in this case.\u201d). The delays in this case are more pronounced than those deemed\nexcessive by the Third Circuit in Brownawell and Podedworny. See Brownawell, 554 F.3d at\n358 (awarding benefits in case involving eight-year delay and two prior remands); Podedworny,\n745 F.2d at 223 (awarding benefits after more than five years of proceedings and two appeals).\nTherefore, the first condition supports a finding of disability and an award of benefits.\n\nB. Development of the Administrative Record\n\nThe court must next determine whether substantial evidence dictates a finding that the\nclaimant is disabled.? See Podedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22. In performing this analysis, the\ncourt is mindful of the Commissioner\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe district courts have no fact-finding\nrole in Social Security cases.\u201d Grant v. Shalala, 989 F.2d 1332, 1338 (3d Cir. 1993).\nNonetheless, the Supreme Court has affirmed the court\u2019s \u201cbroad grant of authority\u201d under \u00a7\n405(g) to enter a judgment reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision without remanding the case\nfor arehearing. Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1765, 1779 (2019).\n\nThe Commissioner contends that remand for further proceedings is appropriate because\nthe ALJ\u2019s articulation of the medical opinion evidence is unclear and does not permit meaningful\njudicial review, and the record contains competing medical opinion evidence. (D.I. 14 at 2-3)\nBut, as in Podedworny, correction of certain defects in the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the medical\nopinion evidence is not enough in this case. 745 F.2d at 222. Instead, the record before the court\nestablishes that the Commissioner\u2019s presentation of medical and vocational evidence is not\n\nsufficient to support a finding that Plaintiff is not disabled. Id.\n\n3 The parties do not appear to dispute the completeness of the administrative record. See\nPodedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22.\nSubstantial evidence in the record before the court supports a conclusion that Plaintiff\ncannot perform sedentary work. Plaintiff seeks benefits for the time between her alleged\ndisability onset date on February 4, 2010, and her date last insured, which was December 31,\n2014. (D.L. 8 at 21) The evidence of record, including most of the opinions by Plaintiff's\ntreating specialists which have been the focal point of multiple remands, falls within this time\nperiod. Because this evidence has been fully developed and will not change, the court concludes\nthat a fourth attempt by the ALJ to assess the evidence is not a worthwhile use of resources. See\nPodedworny, 745 F.2d at 222.\n\nPlaintiff's medical treatment notes from February 4, 2010 through December 31, 2014\nsupport a conclusion that Plaintiff is disabled and entitled to benefits. Plaintiff underwent a first\nrib resection, scalenectomy, and neurolysis to treat her thoracic outlet syndrome in February of\n2010. (D.L. 8-1 at 256-58) Although the surgery eliminated her back and upper chest pain, she\nexperienced pain, tingling, and numbness from her shoulder to her hand. (Jd.) Her surgeon\nconfirmed in follow up treatment notes that Plaintiff would be unable to return to work due to\nher continuing post-operative neurologic symptoms in her left arm, as well as her inability to use\nher right arm. (Jd. at 260-62) On physical examination for her neck and shoulder pain in July of\n2010, Plaintiff showed significant weakness in her rhomboid strength of the left shoulder, and\nthe range of motion in her neck was impaired to about 60%. (Jd. at 863-65) Trigger point\ninjections were not successful in reducing her pain. (/d. at 866)\n\nPlaintiff also received a series of lumbar epidural injections in 2012 to treat back pain\nwhich radiated down her right leg, but she continued to experience low back and mid thoracic\npain. (/d. at 119-20) She underwent a provocative lumbar discography on December 10, 2012,\n\nwhich revealed a grade IV tear at the L3 and L4 spinal segments, followed by a lumbar fusion\nprocedure on April 23, 2013. (/d. at 121-25) Her pain levels in the months following surgery\nwere between six and eight on a scale of ten, and she continued to experience lower back pain\nradiating across her lower limbs. (Jd. at 125-27) Physical therapy notes after her lumbar surgery\nindicate that she could walk for an hour and sit for thirty minutes at a time. (D.I. 8 at 589)\nPlaintiff also received injections in her sacroiliac joint in November of 2013, but the injections\nprovided no relief. (D.I. 8-1 at 130-31) An MRI in April of 2014 revealed postoperative fibrosis\nand narrowing at the L3 and L4 discs. (D.I. 8 at 797)\n\nPlaintiff also sought treatment for knee and hip pain beginning in 2010. Treatment notes\nfrom orthopedist Bruce Katz, M.D., confirm that Plaintiff received injections in both knees in\nNovember of 2010 and discussed distal realignment surgery. (D.I. 8 at 356) Plaintiff also saw\northopedist Alex Bodenstab, M.D. for treatment of her right hip and groin pain. (/d. at 360) Dr.\nBodenstab described her symptoms as \u201cfairly dramatic\u201d and recommended a hip arthroscopy.\n(Id.) On May 31, 2011, Dr. Bodenstab performed a right hip arthroscopic resection of a torn\nlabrum. (Jd. at 364-65) Following the surgery, Plaintiff continued to report pain and groin\ncramping, although she demonstrated increased tolerance for walking. (Jd. at 366-67) In July of\n2011, Dr. Bodenstab described Plaintiffs hip issues as \u201cthe least of her issues right now\u201d and\nnoted that she was under consideration for a patellar realignment to treat damage to the cartilage\nin her knee. (/d. at 369) Physical therapy notes from 2014 confirm that Plaintiff continued to\nexperience groin pain at a level that prevented her physical therapist from initiating strength\ntraining. (D.I. 8-1 at 20) Her pain was exacerbated by lifting, pushing, and pulling. (/d.)\n\nOn October 27, 2011, Plaintiff underwent surgery to treat her moderate to severe plantar\n\nfasciitis and a moderate heel spur which demonstrated bone marrow edema. (D.I. 8-1 at 375,\n387-88) Despite initial improvement post-surgery, Plaintiff's pain returned throughout her entire\nfoot, limiting her to walking no more than one hour per day with pain. (/d. at 398, 416-17)\n\nThe treating specialists who performed Plaintiff's surgeries and treated her pain provided\nmedical opinions that uniformly described severe, work-preclusive limitations. See SSR 96-8p,\n1996 WL 374184, at *1 (July 2, 1996) (explaining that an individual\u2019s ability to do sustained\nwork-related activities on a \u201cregular and continuing basis\u201d means 8 hours a day, for 5 days a\nweek). Dr. Devotta, a pain management specialist, opined in May of 2014 that Plaintiff could\nstand or walk no more than two hours and sit no more than four hours in an eight-hour workday,\nwith one or two unscheduled breaks lasting fifteen to twenty minutes and two or three absences\nper month. (D.I. 8 at 823) Dr. Devotta issued another opinion on June 10, 2015, a few months\nafter Plaintiff's date last insured. (D.I. 8-1 at 845-48) In this assessment, Dr. Devotta reiterated\nthat Plaintiff could stand or walk less than two hours less than two hours in an eight-hour\nworkday and could remain at a workstation for two to three hours total in a standard workday,\nwith one or two unscheduled breaks per day and three absences per month due to her pain and\nother symptoms. (Jd.)\n\nDr. Bose, Plaintiff's orthopedic surgeon, similarly opined in March of 2014 that Plaintiff\ncould sit for two hours in an eight-hour workday and stand, walk, and drive for one hour each in\nan eight-hour workday. (D.L. 8 at 818) In a 2017 opinion, Dr. Bose maintained his opinion that\nPlaintiff had a maximum tolerance of sitting for two hours and standing, walking, or driving for\none hour in an eight-hour workday. (D.I. 8-1 at 448) And Dr. Tuerff, a vascular surgeon, opined\nin October of 2010 that Plaintiff would need to lie down for about two hours per workday and\ntake four to five unscheduled breaks. (Id. at 312-14) These limitations are work preclusive\n\naccording to the vocational expert, who testified that frequent unscheduled breaks and more than\none absence a month would not be tolerated in an employment setting. (D.I. 8-1 at 523, 1065)\nTaking into consideration the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, as well as Plaintiff's medical\nopinions and treatment records, there is substantial evidence to support Plaintiff's inability to\nwork full-time.\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s failure to articulate a sufficient basis for rejecting the medical opinions of\nPlaintiffs treating physicians, despite multiple remands with explicit instructions on how to\nremedy the deficiencies, further supports an award of benefits at this stage. See Pearson v. Saul,\n2020 WL 1865715, at *13 (MLD. Pa. Apr. 14, 2020). The court\u2019s prior remands in this case have\nlargely been based on errors in the ALJ\u2019s assessment of opinions from Plaintiff's treating\nphysicians, Drs. Tuerff, Devotta, and Bose, which in turn impact the adequacy of the RFC\nassessment. (D.I. 8-1 at 620-25); see Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 614 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(explaining that hypothetical posed to vocational expert must accurately portray credibly\nestablished limitations). In 2019, the court determined that the medical opinions of Drs. Devotta\nand Bose describing Plaintiff's significant functional limitations were supported by objective\nmedical evidence, and the ALJ had not adequately discussed the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1527(c) in connection with the medical opinions of Drs. Tuerff, Devotta, and Bose. (D.I. 8-\n1 at 620-25)\n\nThe ALJ has admittedly not been able to remedy these deficiencies in the 2020 and 2022\nopinions. (D.I. 8-1 at 468-69, 1010-11; D.I. 8-2 at 32-33; D.I. 14) In 2021, the Commissioner\nconceded that another remand for further consideration of the opinion evidence and Plaintiff's\nRFC was appropriate, and the Appeals Council set forth specific instructions requiring the ALJ\nto further consider the medical opinion evidence, Plaintiff's RFC, and supplemental vocational\n\nevidence. (D.I. 8-2 at 32-33, 40-42) Nonetheless, the Commissioner now admits that the ALJ\u2019s\n\n10\nMarch 2022 decision was again deficient in the assessment of the treating physician opinions.\n(D.I. 14) In that decision, the ALJ afforded no weight to the opinions of Dr. Bose, Dr. Tuerff, or\nDr. Devotta because the restrictive postural limitations set forth in those opinions were\ninconsistent with the overall record\u2014essentially the same conclusion that was rejected by the\ncourt in the first appeal back in 2019. (D.I. 8-1 at 1010-1 1)\n\nThe Commissioner argues that remand for further proceedings is appropriate because the\nrecord contains competing opinion evidence from a state agency medical expert who challenged\nthe extent of the limitations imposed by Plaintiff's treating physicians and opined Plaintiff could\nstand or walk for four hours and sit for six hours in a normal workday. (D.I. 14 at 3; D.I. 8 at 91)\nBut the court\u2019s 2019 decision explained that the opinions of Drs. Bose and Devotta were\nconsistent with objective medical evidence in the record and noted that the opinions of state\nagency consultants contradicting the treating physicians\u2019 opinions could not properly be credited\nin the absence of an adequate explanation of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for doing so. (D.I. 8-1 at 622-\n25); See Fargnoli v. Massanari, 247 F.3d 34, 43 (3d Cir. 2001). The ALJ was given two more\nopportunities to provide such an explanation, and it is undisputed that the ALJ failed to do so on\nboth occasions. (D.I. 8-1 at 468-69, 1010-11; D.I. 8-2 at 32-33; D.I. 14) This supports a\nconclusion that there is no sufficient basis in the overall record to reject the limitations\nconsistently articulated in the treating physicians\u2019 opinions. After three decisions by the ALJ\nand two failed attempts to repair the record, \u201cit is unreasonable . . . to give the ALJ another\nopportunity to consider new evidence concerning the disability because the administrative\nproceeding would result only in further delay to the receipt of benefits.\u201d Podedworny, 745 F.2d\n\nat 222; see also Smith, 139 S. Ct. at 1779.\n\n11\nIV.
