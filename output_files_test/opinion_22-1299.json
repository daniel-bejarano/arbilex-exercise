WASHINGTON,\nPetitioner,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-1299-GBW\n\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\n\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nIn February 2001, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner\nCorey D. Washington (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) of one count of possession of cocaine with\nintent to deliver, one count of maintaining a vehicle, two counts of possession of\ncocaine within 1000 feet of a school, one court of resisting arrest, one count of\ndriving with a suspended or revoked license, and one count of possession of drug\nparaphernalia. See Washington v. State, 284 A.3d 725 (Table), 2022 WL 4242151,\nat *1 (Del. Sept. 14, 2022). The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as a habitual\n\noffender to life imprisonment plus nine years. See Washington, 2022 WL\n4242151, at *1. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions\nand sentence on March 18, 2002. See Washington v. State, 793 A.2d 311 (Table),\n2002 WL 440253, at *1 (Del. Mar. 18, 2002).\n\nThereafter, Petitioner filed two motions for postconviction relief pursuant to\nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motions\u201d) \u2014 one in 2003 and\none in 2005 \u2014 which were denied. See Washington v. State, 940 A.2d 946 (Table),\n2007 WL 4110636, at *1 (Del. Nov. 20, 2007). Petitioner only appealed the denial\nof his second Rule 61 motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndenial on November 20, 2007. See id. at *2.\n\nIn October 2017, the Superior Court granted Petitioner\u2019s request for a\ncertificate of eligibility to file a petition to modify Petitioner\u2019s habitual offender\nsentence under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214(f). See Washington, 2022 WL 4242151, at *1.\nThe Superior Court granted the petition on December 11, 2018, and reduced\nPetitioner\u2019s life sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver to thirty-\nfive years of Level V incarceration, suspended after fifteen years for decreasing\nlevels of supervision. See id. The remainder of Petitioner\u2019s sentence was\nunchanged. Jd.\n\nOn May 4, 2022, Petitioner filed a Rule 35 motion for correction of an\n\nillegal sentence. See Washington, 2022 WL 4242151, at *1. The Superior Court\n\n2\ndenied the Rule 35 motion on May 11, 2022 for being repetitive and because the\nsentence was appropriate for the reasons set forth at sentencing. See id. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment on September\n14, 2022. See id. at *2.\n\nIn October 2022, Petitioner filed the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) presently pending before the Court.\n(D.I. 1) Petitioner contends that the Delaware state courts violated his Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights by failing to retroactively apply Delaware\u2019s 2011\nNed Carpenter Act! to his case when denying his Rule 35 motion to modify his\nsentence. According to Petitioner, his sentences for possession of cocaine with\nintent to deliver (thirty-five years of Level V incarceration suspended after fifteen\nyears) and two counts of possession within 1000 feet of a school (two years of\nLevel V incarceration for each count) are illegal because the Ned Carpenter Act\n\neliminated or modified those offenses in 2011. (D.I. 1 at 9; D.I. 1-1 at 26)\n\n\u2018Delaware enacted the Ned Carpenter Act in 2011. See Ayala v. State, 204 A.3d\n829, 838 (Del. 2019). \u201cThe Act eliminated the offenses of possession near a park\nand maintaining a dwelling but did not apply retroactively to any violation that\noccurred prior to September 1, 2011.\u201d Jd. at 838-39.\n0. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\nof someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground\nthat his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). It is well-\nsettled that \u201c[s]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law,\u201d? and claims\nbased on errors of state law are not cognizable on habeas review. See Estelle, 502\nUSS. at 67-68. Notably, a district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition\n\u201cif it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it\nthat the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\nIi. DISCUSSION\n\nAlthough presented in terms of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,\nPetitioner\u2019s challenge to the Delaware state courts\u2019 denial of his Rule 35 motion\nfor correction of sentence alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal\nhabeas relief because Petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware state\ncourts\u2019 analysis and application of a state law in a state collateral proceeding. See\nHassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 1998) (holding that the \u201cfederal\n\nrole in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what\n\n2Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).\n4\noccurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner\u2019s\nconviction; what occurred in the petitioner\u2019s collateral proceeding does not enter\ninto the habeas proceeding.\u201d) (emphasis in original); see also Lambert v.\nBlackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (\u201calleged errors in [state] collateral\nproceedings . . . are not a proper basis for habeas relief\u2019). Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that summary dismissal of the instant Petition is appropriate.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant\nPetition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because\nPetitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United\n\nStates v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.\n\nTie\n\nGREGORY B.
