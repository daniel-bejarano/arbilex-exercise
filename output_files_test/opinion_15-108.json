{"case_name": "International Construction Products LLC v. Caterpillar Inc. et al", "case_number": "15-108", "judge": "Judge Richard G. Andrews", "date": "04-17-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nINTERNATIONAL CONSTRUCTION \nPRODUCTS, LLC, \nPlaintiff, \nV. \nCATERPILLAR, INC., et al., \nDefendants. Civil Action No. 15-108-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nDefendant Caterpillar has moved for certification of interlocutory appeal of my denial of \nits summary judgment motion. (D.I. 463). The motion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 465,468, \n471). \nThe parties agree upon the standard for such a certification. I would need to certify that \nthe appeal involves a controlling question of law upon which there is substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion, the resolution of which would materially advance the ultimate termination \nof the litigation. (D.I. 465 at 8; D.I. 468 at 3). Caterpillar says that there are \"at least\" five such \ncontrolling questions of law. (D.I. 465 at 10). \nI think Caterpillar is wrong. It does not cite any cases that are contrary to any of the \ncases I cited in my summary judgment opinion. Indeed, for most of the issues it raises, it is clear \nthat it does not disagree on the law. It merely disagrees with my application of that law to the \nPage 1 of 3 facts of record in this case. It essentially wants a do over with the Court of Appeals on the \napplication of established law to an extensive factual record. \nCaterpillar's first argument is that I impermissibly allowed late amendment of the \npleadings . That is not a \"controlling question of law.\" Amendment of pleadings is a \ndiscretionary decision. \nCaterpillar 's second argument, which is not addressed in the summary judgment opinion, \nis that Caterpillar is too remote to be a defendant when ICP is the plaintiff. ICP is an \"indirect \npurchaser,\" not a \"direct purchaser.\" The argument relates to \"the risk of duplicative recovery \nand the potential for overly-complex damages and apportionment calculations .\" McCarthy v. \nRecordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 851 n.14 (3d Cir. 1996). Caterpillar did not address either the \nrisk of duplicative recoveries1 or the potential for problems related to damages in its summary \njudgment briefing. (D.I. 391 at 34-35; D.I. 433 at 6-7). It does not hint at any such argument in \nthe instant briefing either. \nCaterpillar's third argument is that I ruled incorrectly on its collateral estoppel argument. \nI put it like this because Caterpillar and I agree that the same Third Circuit case states the law. \n(D.I. 456 at 23; D.I. 465 at 13). There is no dispute about a controlling question of law.2 \nCaterpillar's fourth argument is, essentially, that the great weight of the evidence is on its \nside. That could be true, but that is not the standard that applies when considering summary \njudgment. Caterpillar characterizes Plaintiffs evidence as \"speculation.\" (D.I. 465 at 15). \nCaterpillar simply disagrees with my analysis of the record. \n1 I cannot see how there would be any risk at all. \n2 Although not germane to this Memorandum Order, I note that the related case in Florida was \nargued to the Eleventh Circuit on December 13, 2022. \nPage 2 of 3 Caterpillar's fifth argument is that the evidence for the tortious interference claim is \ninsufficient. I do not think there is any disagreement on the applicable law. Rather, the \ndisagreement is on whether the record provides a basis for Plaintiff to move forward on this \nclaim. That is not a controlling question of law. \nCaterpillar's motion (D.I. 463) is DENIED. \n{L~ \nIT IS SO ORDERED this I day of April 2023. \nPage 3 of 3 "}
