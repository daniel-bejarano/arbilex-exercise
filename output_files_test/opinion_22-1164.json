Civil Action No. 22-1164-CFC-SRF\nVBIT TECHNOLOGIES CORP., VBIT MINING\nLLC, ADVANCED MINING GROUP, DANH\nCONG VO a/k/a DON VO, KATIE VO, SEAN\nTU, LILLIAN ZHAO, JOHN DOE INDIVIDUALS\n1-10, and ABC COMPANIES 1-10,\n\nDefendants.\n\new NOW A SS A SS OS\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nPresently before the court in this civil action alleging violations of federal securities laws\nand Delaware law, is plaintiff Morgan C. Huntley\u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) unopposed motion for leave to\namend the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). (D.I. 40) For the\nfollowing reasons, Plaintiffs motion to amend is GRANTED.!\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff filed this action against defendants VBit Technologies Corp., VBit Mining LLC,\nAdvanced Mining Group, Danh Cong Vo a/k/a Don Vo, Katie Vo, Sean Tu, Jin Gao, Lillian\nZhao, and various John Doe individual defendants and ABC companies (\u201cDefendants\u201d) on\nSeptember 2, 2022, alleging violations of various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and asserting causes of action for common law fraud, breach of\n\ncontract, and unjust enrichment under Delaware law. (D.I. 1) Five named Defendants answered\n\n| Filings associated with the pending motion are found at D.I. 42, D.I. 44, DI. 45, D.L. 46, and\nDI. 47.\nthe complaint. (D.I. 9; D.I. 11; D.I. 18) Defendants Lillian Zhao and Advanced Mining Group\ndid not respond to the complaint.? Defendant Jin Gao filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for\nimproper venue pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), and Plaintiff subsequently\nfiled a notice of voluntary dismissal of Jin Gao, resulting in termination of the motion to dismiss.\nMI. 22; D.I. 31)\n\nPlaintiff filed the pending motion for leave to amend on March 6, 2023, seeking to add\nthirty-five plaintiffs, remove existing defendant Katie Vo from the lawsuit, and add corporate\naffiliate VBit DC Corp. as a defendant. (D.I. 40, Ex. B) The proposed amended complaint also\nraises additional factual allegations and includes six additional causes of action against\nDefendants. (/d.) The additional counts include causes of action for negligent\nmisrepresentation, civil conspiracy, violations of the Delaware Uniform Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act and Consumer Fraud Act, violations of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices\nand Consumer Protection Law, appointment of a receiver, and successor liability / de facto\nmerger or consolidation. (/d., Ex. B at {J 170-78, 191-219) Plaintiff alleges that these factual\nallegations were recently discovered as a result of further engagement by Plaintiff's counsel with\nvictims of Defendants\u2019 conduct and additional due diligence and factual research performed by\nPlaintiff's counsel. (D.I. 40 at 3)\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that after a responsive\n\npleading has been filed, a party may amend its pleading \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written\n\nconsent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d and \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d\n\n2 In the pending motion, Plaintiff indicates he \u201chas not yet determined whether Defendants\nLillian Zhou and Advanced Mining Group exist[.]\u201d (D.L 40 at 2)\n\n2\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies within the discretion\nof the court. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs.\nLitig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to\nthe amendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Arco, 921 F.2d 484, 487 (3d Cir. 1990). In the absence\nof undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the amendment\nshould be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non-moving party. See\nFoman, 371 U.S. at 182; In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1434.\n\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff's motion to amend is granted. There is no undue delay because Plaintiff sought\nleave to amend only six months after the original complaint was filed, before a scheduling order\nwas entered. (D.I. 1; D.I. 40) Plaintiff explains that the proposed amendment could not be made\nsooner because the additional factual allegations and causes of action are based on information\nobtained from the proposed additional plaintiffs. (D.I. 40 at 3)\n\nMoreover, no Defendant has indicated that Plaintiffs proposed amended pleading would\nbe futile or would result in undue prejudice. (D.I. 42; D.I. 45; D.I. 46; D.I. 47) Defendants\nanswered the original complaint in lieu of moving to dismiss, and they raise no opposition to the\nnewly added counts in the proposed amended complaint. (D.I. 9; D.I. 11; D.I. 18)\n\nConsequently, there is no basis on the present record to deny Plaintiff's motion to amend under\nRule 15(a). See Tri-State Energy Sols., LLP v. KVAR Energy Savings, Inc., C.A. No. 08-209-SD,\n2010 WL 11707411, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2010) (granting unopposed motion to join additional\nparties and add certain counts to the complaint).\n\nThe proposed amended complaint removes Katie Vo as a defendant. (D.I. 40, Ex. B) In\n\nhis reply letter, Plaintiff confirms that the omission of Katie Vo from the proposed amended\npleading was intentional. (D.I. 44 at \u00a7 6) Having granted Plaintiff's motion to amend the\ncomplaint, I recommend that the court dismiss defendant Katie Vo from the action without\nprejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is GRANTED in the\nform attached as Exhibit A to the pending motion.? (D.I. 40) The proposed amended complaint\nattached to the motion to amend shall be docketed by the clerk as the amended pleading. In\naccordance with the amended complaint and the parties\u2019 agreement, I recommend that the court\ndismiss defendant Katie Vo from the action without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 41(a)(2).
