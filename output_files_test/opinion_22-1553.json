CLARK, ) \n) \nPetitioner, ) \n) \nV. ) \n) \n) \nROBERT MAY, Warden, and ) \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE ) \nST A TE OF DELAWARE , ) \n) \nRespondents . ) Civil Action No. 22-1553-RGA \nMEMORANDUM \nPetitioner is proceeding prose with a petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\"Petition\"). (D.I. 3) \nIn 2005, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of six counts of first degree \nunlawful sexual intercourse, four counts of second degree unlawful sexual intercourse, and two \ncounts of continuous sexual abuse of a child. (D.I. 3-1 at 7); see Clark v. State, 900 A.2d 100 \n(Table), 2006 WL 1186738, at* 1 (Del. 2006). The two victims were the seven and nine year old \nsons of Petitioner 's girlfriend at the time. See Clark, 2006 WL 1186738 at *l. On May 23, \n2005, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to 102 years of incarceration . The Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner's convictions May 2, 2006. See Clark, 2006 WL 1186738, at \n*2. \nIn 2022, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a pro se motion for correction of \nsentence pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 35(a). (D.I. 3 at 4; D.I. 3-1 at 10) \nThe Rule 35(a) motion alleged that the \"Superior Court failed to give all but one charge an effective date as to when [Petitioner's] sentences were to begin.\" (D.I. 3 at 4) The Superior \nCourt denied the Rule 35(a) motion on November 16, 2022, and Petitioner does not indicate ifhe \nappealed that decision. (D.I. 3; D.I. 3-1 at 10) \nOn November 30, 2022, Petitioner filed the instant Petition and a Motion for Leave to \nProceed In Forma Pauperis . (D.I. 1; D.I. 3) The Petition asserts four grounds for relief: (1) trial \ncounsel provided ineffective assistance during Petitioner 's 2005 criminal proceeding ; (2) the \nSuperior Court did not provide effective dates for the sentences imposed for eleven of his twelve \n2005 convictions; (3) in 2022, the Superior Court violated Delaware state law by denying \nPetitioner's Rule 35(a) motion; and (4) the Superior Court judge who denied Petitioner's rule \n35(a) motion in 2022 acted with a closed mind. (D.I. 3) \nI. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES \nThe instant Petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. A district court may entertain a petition for a writ of \nhabeas corpus on behalf of someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on \nthe ground that his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States, 1 and \nmay summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and \nany exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 \n2254. Notably, claims based on errors of state law are not cognizab le on habeas review. See \nEstelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684,691 (1975) (noting that \"[s]tate \ncourts are the ultimate expositors of state law.\"). \n1See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). \nj \n2 II. DISCUSSION \nA. Claims Three and Four: State Law Issues \nClaims Three and Four challenge the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner's Rule 35 \nmotion for modification of sentence and, therefore, involve matters of state law. See Lambert v. \nBlackwell, 387 F.3d 210,247 (3d Cir. 2004) (\"alleged errors in [state] collateral proceedings ... \nare not a proper basis for habeas relief'); Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. \n1998) (holding that the \"federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to \nevaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner's \nconviction; what occurred in the petitioner's collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas \nproceeding.\") (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss Claims \nThree and Four for failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. \nB. Claims One and Two: Time-Barred \nIn contrast, Claims One and Two assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. \nNevertheless, as explained below, the Court's preliminary review indicates that Claims One and \nTwo are time-barred under AEDPA's one-year statute oflimitations . See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b); \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l) ; United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir. 1999); Mason v. Meyers, \n208 F.3d 414 (3d Cir. 2000). \nAEDP A imposes a one-year filing deadline that runs from the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion \nof direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such \nreview; \n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application \ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of \nthe United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from \nfiling by such state action; \n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially \n3 recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly \nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively \napplicable to cases on collateral review; or \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims \npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due \ndiligence. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l). The Court does not discern any facts triggering the application of\u00a7 \n2244(d)(l)(B),(C), or (D). Consequently, the one-year period oflimitations for Claims One and \nTwo began to run when Petitioner's convictions became final under\u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A) . \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244( d)(l )(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment but does \nnot seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the statute of \nlimitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed for seeking \ncertiorari review. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012). In this case, the Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner 's convictions on May 2, 2006, and it appears that he did not \nseek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his judgment of conviction became \nfinal on August 1, 2006. Applying the one-year limitations period to that date, Petitioner had \nuntil August 1, 2007 to timely file a habeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 \n(3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA's limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, \n2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA's one-year limitations period is \ncalculated according to the anniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on the \nanniversary of the date it began to run). Petitioner filed the instant Petition on November 30, \n2022, approximately fifteen years after that deadline. Thus, the Court's preliminary screening of \nthe Petition indicates that the remaining cognizable habeas claims -Claims One and Two -are \nuntimely. \n4 AEDPA's limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling. See Holland, \n560 U.S. at 645 (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may \nalso be excused from failing to comply with the limitations period by making a gateway showing \nof actual innocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021). Nevertheless, for \nthe reasons set forth below, none of these doctrines appear to render Claims One and Two timely \nfiled. \n1. Statutory tolling \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA's \nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post\u00ad\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of \nAEDPA's limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A \npost-conviction motion is '\"properly filed' for statutory tolling purposes when its delivery and \nacceptance is in compliance with the state's applicable laws and rules governing filings, such as \nthe form of the document , any time limits upon its delivery, the location of the filing, and the \nrequisite filing fee.\" Crump v. Phelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations \nperiod is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be \nfiled even if the appeal is not eventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. \nPetitioner filed his Rule 35 motion for correction of sentence in 2022, at least sixteen \nyears after the expiration of AEDP A's statute of limitations. Therefore , statutory tolling is \ninapplicable. \n2. Equitable tolling and actual innocence \nEquitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the petitioner \ndemonstrates \"(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary \n5 circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\" Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With \nrespect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to \nthe petitioner 's excusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary circumstance \nrequirement, \"the relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is \nunique to the petitioner , but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA's \none-year deadline.\" Pabon v. Mahanoy , 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary \ncircumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \"a causal connection, or nexus, \nbetween the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner's failure to file a timely federal \npetition.\" Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). Specifically , \"if the person seeking \nequitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the \nextraordinary circumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary \ncircumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did \nnot prevent timely filing.\" Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768 , 773 (3d Cir.2003). The burden is \non the petitioner to prove that he has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights. See Urcinoli \nv. Cathe!, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir.2008). \nIn addition, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \"equitable exception \" \nthat can overcome the bar of AEDPA's one-year limitations period. See McQuiggin v. Perkins, \n569 U.S 383,392 (2013); Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 150-51 (3d Cir. 2021). A petitioner \nsatisfies the actual innocence exception by (1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his \ninnocence; and (2) showing \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that \"a reasonable juror would \nhave reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new evidence. \" Id. at 151. \nPetitioner does not assert his actual innocence , but asks the Court to excuse his late filing \nbecause he is \"doing [his] own legal work prose and learning as [he] go[es].\" (D.I. 3 at 14) A \n6 prisoner's prose status does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance for equitable tolling \npurposes. See Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that a prose \npetitioner's misunderstanding of the law is insufficient to equitably toll habeas limitations \nperiod). Nevertheless, since the Court sua sponte raises the issue of timeliness , Petitioner shall \nhave another opportunity to address the issues of equitable tolling and actual innocence and show \ncause why his Petition should not be dismissed as time-barred. See Day v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 198, 209-10 (2006) ( district courts are authorized to consider sua sponte the timeliness of a \nstate prisoner's habeas petition, but must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to \npresent their positions); United States v. Bendolph, 409 F.3d 155, 165 n.15 (3d Cir. 2005). \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss Claims Three and Four \nfor failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. Petitioner, however, shall be \ngiven an opportunity to show cause why Claims One and Two should not dismissed as time\u00ad\nbarred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l) . In his response to this Memorandum and Order, Petitioner \nshall state with specificity any facts establishing a credible claim of actual innocence or facts that \nmay entitle him to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations for Claims One and Two. \nAdditionally, the Court will grant Petitioner 's Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis. The Court \nwill issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum. \nDated: April 14, 2023 \n7 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRJCT OF DELAWARE \nJAMES T.
