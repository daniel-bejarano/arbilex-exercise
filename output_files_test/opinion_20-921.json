Because \nDwayne  Cropper failed to do so, I must grant summary judgment for defendants .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Prison guards use force to extract Cropper from his cell  \nCropper is a Delaware prison inmate. In his cell, prison guards found a makeshift  \nknife.  D.I. 55 -1, at A14 0, 14 2; D.I.  59, at PA168 . So they decided to move him 2 elsewhere. D.I. 59, at PA168 \u201369. But he refused to leave.  D.I. 55 -1, at A547; D.I. 59 , \nat PA169; see also D.I. 50 , at 2:02 \u20132:30. To force him out, they used a pepper -ball \nlauncher . D.I. 55 -1, at A114 . But rather than complying , Cropper  used a blanket to \nshield himself and darted around his cell. D.I. 50 , at 2:34 \u20133:08. At some point, a pep-\nper ball hit him in the eye, r upturing it.  See D.I. 59, at PA56 \u201357. \nBut still Cropper  did not  comply. D.I. 50 , at 3:08 \u20135:20. So prison guards entered \nhis cell  and eventually managed to  restrai n him. Id.; D.I. 55 -1, at A549 \u201350. They  then \ntook him  to the infirmary. Id. at A114. Cropper spent an extended period  in the re, \nbedridden  with his eyes shut.  D.I. 59, at PA21 \u201358. \nNow Cropper  sues the officials involved for excessive force  and failure to train  \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  1983 . D.I. 21 \u00b6 \u00b6 9, 17, 22\u201324. He also brings various state -law \nclaims . Id. \u00b6 19. \nB. The prison made  remedies available to Cropper   \nThe prison automatically began investigating  the use of force . See D.I. 55-1, at \nA145, A435\u201337. That investigation  found that the guards had acted appropriately \nand that no follow -up was necessary . See id. at A145, A443 \u201344. \nThe prison  also had various processes to let inmates lodge complaints  themselves . \nThere  was a process to seek an investigation into prison staff, a medical grievance \nprocess, and a  general grievance process  for other issues . D.I. 55 -1, at A7 \u00b6 3a, A9 \n\u00a7 VII, A14 \u00a7 X. To request an investigation of prison staff , inmates  must write to the \nArea Superv isor or Unit Commander ; they cannot use the general grievance process. \nId. at A7 \u00b6  3a, A16 (listing \u201cStaff Investigation\u201d as reason general grievance would be \nreturned unprocessed). If they are unhappy  with the response  or get none , they can 3 appeal  to the Security Superintendent and then to the Warden. Id. Unlike the general \ngrievance process,  which has a seven -day deadline , there is no deadline to seek  a staff \ninvestigation. Compare id. , with id. at A9 \u00a7 VII.A.  \nII. CROPPER FAILED TO EXHAUST HIS ADMINI STRATIVE REMEDIES  \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act bars prisoners from suing  under federal law  \n\u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1997e(a). The Act speaks o f exhausting claims \u201cwith respect to prison conditions ,\u201d \nand the Supreme  Court has interpreted this requirement  to apply to \u201call inmate suits \nabout prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes. \u201d \nId.; Porter v. Nussle , 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002).  Exhaustion  is a \u201cthres hold issue that \ncourts must address.\u201d Rinaldi v. United States , 904 F.3d 257, 265 (3d Cir. 2018) (em-\nphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) .  \nFailing to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense. Id. at 268. \nSo defendants have the burd en to prove that an inmate failed to exhaust.  Id. \u201cBut \nonce [defendants ] ha[ve] established that the inmate failed to resort to administrative \nremedies, the onus falls on the inmate to show that such remedies were unavailable \nto him.\u201d  Id. Because  defendants have met their burden  but Cropper has not met  his, \nI grant them summary judgment.   \nOne note  on procedure:  \u201c[J]udges may resolve factual disputes relevant to the ex-\nhaustion issue without the participation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty. , 728 F .3d \n265, 271 (3d Cir. 2013) . Although an evidentiary hearing is not required, I held o ne \nto ensure that all parties could fully present their arguments . See Paladino v. New-\nsome , 885 F.3d 203, 210 \u201311 (3d Cir. 2018) ; see also  Parkell v. Lyons , 2020 WL 4 535025 0, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 4, 2020)  (\u201c[A] district court may elect to resolve factual \ndisputes regarding exhaustion without the participation of a jury, including on a sum-\nmary judgment motion.\u201d) . The parties also submitted more documents after the hear-\ning. See D.I. 79; D.I. 80; D.I. 81.  Having considered all evidence, I find that Cropper \nfailed to  show that the prison\u2019s administrative remedy was unavailable.  \nA. Cropper failed to use his administrative remedy  \nDefendants show , and Cropper admits , that he never wrote to the Area Supervisor \nor Unit Commander  to request an investigation  into the pepper -ball incident. See D.I. \n55-1, at A552.  Seven months later , he did file  a medical grievance, seeking  follow -up \ncare. See id. at A155. In that grievance, he said a pepper ball had hit him in the eye . \nId. But he did not complain about the officers\u2019 use of force  or the ir lack of training . \nSee id.   \nAnd even if he had, that would not be enough . The Prison Litigation Reform Act  \nrequires \u201cprope r exhaustion ,\u201d which \u201c demands compliance with \u2026 critical procedural \nrules.\u201d  Woodford v. Ngo , 548 U.S. 81, 90 \u201391 (2006). The process for complaining about \nstaff was separate from the process for submitting a medical grievance . Compare  D.I. \n55-1, at A7 \u00b6 3a, with id. at A14 \u00a7 X. Under the former process, writing to the Super-\nvisor or Commander was the critical procedural rule. Because  Cropper failed to  com-\nply with that  rule, he did not properly exhaust  the relevant  administrative remed y.  \nB. Cropper has not sh own that the remedy was unavailable  \nThe burden thus shifts to him to show  that the administrative remedy was una-\nvailable. See Rinaldi , 904 F.3d at 268.  The Supreme Court has identified three  situ-\nations in which an administrative remedy  is unavailable : (1) when it \u201coperates as a 5 simple dead -end,\u201d (2)  when it is \u201cso opaque\u201d that it is \u201cincapable of use,\u201d  and (3) when \nprison officials \u201cthwart\u201d inmates from using it through \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d See Ross \nv. Blake , 578 U.S. 632, 643 \u201344 (2016) . Cropper says all three (plus one more beyond \nSupreme Court precedent) apply  here.  But none do es. \n1. There is  no evidence  that the process was a dead  end. Cropper says he had  writ-\nten the Area  Supervisor or Unit Commander  to request investigations  in the past  but \nthey never  replied . See D.I. 55 -1, at A552. The lack of a reply , however,  does not mean  \nthat the proce ss was unavailable. All that is needed  is \u201cthe possibility of some relief.\u201d \nBooth v. Churner , 532 U.S. 731, 738 \u201339 (2001). Cropper has introduced no  evidence \nthat relief was impossible.   \nAnd the Warden\u2019s testimony  confirms that submitting a request could lead to re-\nlief. If writing to the Area Supervisor or Unit Commander to request an investigation \ndid not yi eld a satisfactory outcome , inmates could appeal up  the chain to the Warden. \nWhen the Warden received an appeal , he would reply if he \u201cneeded additional infor-\nmation.\u201d See D.I. 55 -1 at A492. Otherwise, he would have his deputies \u201clook into [the \nappeals ] for any further information they might find.\u201d Id. These appeals had (at least \nonce in the Warden\u2019s short tenur e) resulted in  staff discipline.  Id.; see also  id. at \nA488 \u2013489 (explaining that he started as Warden in July 2017 and has had two other \njobs since then) . So Cropper has failed to carry his burden of showing that this remedy \nwas a dead  end. \nTrue, an otherwise -available administrative remedy could be a dead  end because \nof a parallel proceeding . See Ross , 578 U.S. at 645\u201348. And Cropper\u2019s incident  6 triggered an automatic use-of-force investigation.  D.I. 55 -1, at A145 . But Cropper \ngives no evidence that making a request  would have been futile because of this par-\nallel proceeding.  Cf. Ross , 578 U.S. at 645\u201348 (summarizing evidence that inmate \ncould not obtain relief through normal remedial process  because a \u201cparallel\u201d in vesti-\ngation was already pending) . \n2. The process was not opaque.  Nor was the process for submitting a request  \u201cso \nopaque\u201d that it was \u201cincapable of use.\u201d  Id. at 643. As mentioned, Cropper admits that \nhe has asked for staff investigations before . See D.I. 5 5-1, at A552. So the process was \nusable.   \nTo show  opacity , Cropper cites several cases finding that his prison\u2019s instructions \nfor exhausting unprocessed grievances were opaque . See, e.g. , Fatir v. Phelps , 2021 \nWL 827142, at *7 \u20138 (D. Del. Mar. 4, 2021);  Abbatiello v. Metzger , 2021 WL 678137, \nat *4 (D. Del. Feb. 22, 2021) ; see also  D.I. 80, at 2 . But those cases are irrelevant here. \nCropper did not get a grievance r eturned unprocessed;  he never submitted one  in the \nfirst place . Plus, as explained, the relevant administrative process  was not filing a \ngrievance  but writing the Area Supervisor or Unit Commander  to request an investi-\ngation . D.I. 55 -1, at A7 \u00b6  3a. \n3. There is no evidence that Cropper was thwarted.  Finally, there is no evide nce \nthat prison officials thwarted him from using  the administrative remedy.  He says he \nwas told that he could not submit  a request  from the infirmary . See D.I. 55 -1, at A552 ; \nD.I. 83 , at 4:18\u201321. Though  I do not doubt his sincerity, I do doubt  his recollection . \nHe could not recall who told him this  or when . See D.I. 55 -1, at A552 \u201353; D.I. 83 , at 7 4:25\u20137:9, 8:8 \u201315, 10:6 \u201311:14. So it seems unlikely that any officials in the infirmary \nstopped him from making a request \u201cthrough machination, misrepresentation, or in-\ntimidation.\u201d Ross , 578 U.S. at 644.  \nBut e ven if his memory is sound , Cropper  has failed to show that he was thwarted \nfrom submitting a request after leaving  the infirmary. He says he thought that there \nwas a seven -day deadline because \u201cit says [that] on the grievance.\u201d  See D.I. 83 , at \n6:21\u20137:14. But as explained, requests to investigate  staff members do not involve a \ngrievance. Instead, inmates must  write to an Area Supervisor or Unit Commander.  \nSee D.I. 55 -1, at A7 \u00b6  3a. He had done so  in the past , suggesting that he knew this \nwas a separate process not involving a grievance . See id. at A552. So the general \ngrievanc e form \u2019s seven -day deadline should  not have confused him into thinking he \nhad only seven  days to file a written request.  \nNor are the procedures for requesting a staff investigation  written in such a way  \nthat \u201cno ordinary prisoner\u201d would know that there was no deadline for doing so . Ross , \n578 U.S. 643 \u201344. Those  procedures are listed in a single paragraph on page three  of \nthe inmate grievance policy , under the subheading \u201cStaff Investigation.\u201d See D.I. 55-\n1, at A7 \u00b6  3a. No deadline is given. Id. True, later in the document , there is a seven -\nday deadline  for general grievances . Id. at A9 \u00a7  VII.A. But that deadline does not \napply to staff investigations , which do no t go through the general grievance process . \nIt is listed under the heading \u201cNon -Emergency Grievance Resolution Steps\u201d and is \ndiscussed in connection with filing a \u201cGrievance Form ,\u201d which is not used for request-\ning a staff investigation . Id. And e ven if an inmate might  assume  that this seven -day 8 deadline also applied to staff investigations, \u201c[t]he  procedures need not be suffi ciently \n\u2018plain\u2019 as to preclude any reasonable mistake or debate with respect to their mean-\ning.\u201d  Ross , 578 U.S. at 644. \u201cWhen an administrative process is susceptible of multiple \nreasonable interpretations, Congress has determined that the inmate should err  on \nthe side of exhaustion.\u201d Id. So Cropper should have made a request after he left the \ninfirmary even if he thought that it might be too late . \n4. Cropper\u2019s injury does not excuse his failure to exhaust.  Finally, beyond  the three \nsituations identified by the Supreme Court,  Cropper also suggests that he could not  \nsubmit a request  because his eye was injured . See D.I. 58, at  17. The Second and Fifth \nCircuits have held that an administrative remedy is unavailable when it fails to ac-\ncommodat e those whose physical injuries  prevent them from using the  remedy within \nthe allotted time.  See Rucker v. Giffen , 997 F.3d 88 , 90 (2d Cir. 2021); Days  v. John-\nson, 322 F.3d 863, 868 (5th Cir. 2003) .  \nYet even  if the Third Circuit adopt ed a similar rule , it would not apply here . Crop-\nper could have filed a request after his injury healed . Indeed, Cropper filed other  \ngrievances  within four months of the pepper -ball incident . See D.I. 55 -1, at A146. If \nhe could file those grievances, he could also have requested an investigation.   Because \nCropper failed to do so , I must grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on \nhis \u00a7 1983 claims.  \nIII. CROPPER\u2019S FAILURE TO EXHAUST ALSO BARS HIS STATE -LAW CLAIMS  \nI also grant summary judgment for defendants on Cropper\u2019s state -law claims. Del-\naware likewise bars prisoners from filing a complaint \u201crelating to a condition of 9 confinement \u2026 unless the prisoner has fully exhausted all administrative remedies \navailable through the institutional grievance procedure.\u201d 10 Del. C. \u00a7  8804(g) .  \nDelaware courts have applied this exhaustion requirement to complaints about \nisolated  incidents.  See Laub v. Danberg , 2009 WL 1152167, at *1 , *4 (Del. Super. Ct. \nMar. 4, 2009), aff\u2019d, 979 A.2d 1111 (Del. 2009) (applying exhaustion requirement to \nretaliation claim against prison officials) ; In re Petition of Reed , 2004 WL 823431, at \n*1\u20132 & n.5 (Del. Ch. Feb. 2, 2004)  (applying exh austion requirement to claim that \nprison officials had taken an inmate\u2019s  personal property  during a shakedown ). So \nCropper needed to exhaust his administrative remedies  before bringing his state -law \nclaims too . Because  he did not do so, those  claims must be dismissed  as well . \n* * * * * \n\u201c[A] court may not excuse a failure to exhaust, even to take [special] circumstances \ninto account.\u201d Ross , 578 U.S. at 639. So I must grant summary judgment for defend-\nants. "}
