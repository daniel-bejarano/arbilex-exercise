{"case_name": "Stephenson v. May et al", "case_number": "20-443", "judge": "Judge Gregory B. Williams", "date": "04-10-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\nJOSHUA STEPHENSON,\nPetitioner,\nv. : Civil Action No. 20-443-GBW\nROBERT MAY, Warden,\nand ATTORNEY GENERAL\nOF THE STATE OF\nDELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nAt Wilmington this isis day of April, 2023, having considered\nPetitioner\u2019s second and incomplete \u00a7 2254 petition (D.I. 49) that he filed in the instant\nproceeding after the Court\u2019s denial of his original \u00a7 2254 Petition (D.I. 47; D.I. 48);\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, to the extent Petitioner\u2019s second and partially\ncompleted petition presents the same arguments challenging his 2015 convictions that the\nCourt already considered and denied, the petition (D.I. 49) is DISMISSED as an\nunauthorized second or successive habeas petition. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A);\nBenchoff v. Colleran, 404 F.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 2005) (explaining that a habeas petition\n\nis classified as second or successive within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 ifa prior\n\npetition has been decided on the merits, the prior and new petitions challenge the same\nconviction, and the new petition asserts a claim that was, or could have been, raised in a\nprior habeas petition).\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent the Court should liberally\nconstrue the incomplete petition to be a request for a certificate of appealability, the\nrequest (D.I. 49) is denied for the same reasons provided in the Court\u2019s Memorandum\nOpinion and Order dated March 9, 2023. (See D.I. 47 at 41; D.L. 48)\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent the second petition should be\nliberally construed as a Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider the Court\u2019s decision, the motion\n(D.I. 49) is denied. Rule 59(e) is \u201ca device [] used to allege legal error,\u201d! and may only\nbe used to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\nSee Howard Hess Dental Labs, Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l Inc., 602 F.3d 237, 251 (3d Cir.\n2010). The scope of a Rule 59(e) motion is extremely limited, and may not be used as an\nopportunity to relitigate the case. See Blystone v. Horn, 664 F.3d 397, 414 (d Cir.\n2011); see also Brambles USA Inc. v. Blocker, 735 F. Supp. 1239, 1240 (D. Del. 1990).\nThe moving party must show one of the following in order to prevail on a Rule 59(e)\nmotion: (1) an intervening change in the controlling law; (2) the availability of new\nevidence that was not available when the court issued its order; or (3) the need to correct\n\na clear error of law or fact or to prevent a manifest injustice. See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 v.\n\n1Fyorelli, 337 F.3d at 288.\n\nQuinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir. 1999). for being untimely. Here, the second\npetition merely re-asserts the same arguments contained in Petitioner\u2019s original \u00a7 2254\nPetition and, therefore, does not provide any reason warranting reconsideration of the\nCourt\u2019s dismissal of his original \u00a7 2254 Petition.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, to the extent one is required, the Court\ndeclines to issue a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); see also Slack v.\n\nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).\n\nJ. 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n"}
