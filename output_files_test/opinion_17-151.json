No. 17 -151- LPS \n       : BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA,  : \n       :  Defendant.     : ______________________________________________________________________________  \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nAt Wilmington, this 11th  day of April, 2023: \nThe Venezuela Parties1 moved to disqualify the Special Master (D.I. 509), relying on 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 455, Canons 2 and 3 of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, and the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,  based on his ex parte \ncommunication s with OFAC on January 12, 20232 and based on his purported \u201cadvocacy\u201d to the \nUnited States Government.  The Court considered the parties\u2019 respective briefs and related filings and heard oral argument on the motion on March 30, 2023.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court denied the motion.  (D.I. 538)  The Court\u2019s reasoning, which it endeavored to \n \n1 Capitalized terms that are not defined herein are defined in the Sale Procedures Order (D.I. \n481). \n \n2 The Venezuela Parties had, on Monday, January 9, 2023, moved for an order directing the \nSpecial Master to permit counsel for the Venezuela Parties to att end the Thursday, January 12, \n2023 meeting.  (D.I. 499)  On January 10, 2023, the Court issued an expedited briefing schedule.  (D.I. 500)  O n January 11, the Court denied the motion, based on considerations including \nuntimeliness and that the ex parte  interactions challenged by the Venezuela Parties were \nexplicitly contemplated and permitted by the Sale Procedures Order.  ( See D.I. 506) 2 \n explain from the bench  (see D.I. 542 at 103- 21), and all of which is incorporated herein by \nreference, is essentially as follows:  \n. . .  [A] s all parties recognize in their extensive briefing, the motion is largely a \nrehash of the Venezuela parties \u2019 motion to be included in the special master \u2019s \nJanuary 12th meeting with OFAC, a motion I denied . . . .  I will refer to that \n[meeting] as the OFAC meeting or January 12th meeting, even though we learned \ntoday that OFAC was apparently not present at the meeting.  \n \nMy denial of the motion for disqualification today is based on, essentially, the same reasoning that I gave in denying the meeti ng-related motion, but I do want to \nexpound on that reasoning.  The first basis for denying the motion is that the burden to prevail on it is on the moving party[, which must]  . . . show  bias or some other \nreason for disqualification, and it is a substanti al burden, and the  Venezuela parties \nsimply have not met it. [\n3]  There is no evidence before the Court that the  special \nmaster engaged in advocacy in the OFAC  meeting.   There \u2019s no evidence, in \nparticular,  that he advocated for a change in U.S. foreign policy or advocated for \nCrystallex to be  granted a license.  \n So one, but not the sole, ground on which I\u2019m denying the motion is the failure of proof by the Venezuela parties.  In my mind, that is  a denial on the merits, and I \nwill have a  little more to say o n the merits, but I now  want to say something about \nsome of the  procedural bases on which I \u2019m denying the  motion as well.  \n \nThe first one is that [the] motion to  disqualify, in my view, is untimely.  This is a  \nbasis to deny the motion on all the grounds on which it is asserted; that is, section \n455(a), [s]ection 455(b), Canons 2 and 3 of the Code of  Judicial Conduct, and the \ndue process clause of  the Fifth Amendment.  \n \nI don\u2019 t think it\u2019s disputed that there is a timeliness requirement for filing su ch a \nmotion.  The Third Circuit said as much in . . . Kensington.[\n4]  Parties seeking \ndisqualification [pursuant to]  Section 455(a) should do so in a timely manner.  And \nthen in a case called Stone [H]e[d]ge Properties, the Third Circuit also noted that \nthere is a timeliness requirement for a disqualification motion under section \n455(b).[5] \n \n3 See, e.g., Schweiker v. McClure, 456 U.S. 188, 196 (1982) (\u201c[T]he burden of establishing a \ndisqualifying interest rests on the party making the assertion.\u201d); see also  United States v. \nMicrosoft Corp. , 253 F.3d 34, 108 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201cDisqualification is never taken lightly.  In \nthe wrong hands, a disqualification motion is a procedural weapon to harass opponent s and delay \nproceedings.\u201d).  \n \n4 In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd., 368 F.3d 289, 312 (3d Cir. 2004).  \n \n5 Stone Hedge Props. v. Phoenix Cap. Corp., 71 F. App\u2019x 138, 141 (3d Cir. 2003).  3 \n Here the motion is untimely because the grounds for it were known to the moving \nparties for at least many months prior to the filing of their motion.  A good summary of the relevant timeline showing that all the parties have known since approximately May of 2021 that the special master had engaged OFAC counsel and was in ex parte communication with OFAC is set out in Crystallex \u2019s response to \nthe motion, DI 513 at pages 3 to 5.  The ex parte meetings, including what the Venezuela parties now refer to as advocacy, to the extent those are two different grounds for the motion, ex parte meeting s and advocacy, both of these things, as \nproperly understood, were contemplated thr oughout the process of negotiating and \nlitigating the sales procedures order, which was adopted in October 2022.  And this \ngave  rise to the notice, actual notice, to the  moving parties  that the concerns they \nbelatedly  raised could and should have been raised much  sooner.  \n So for example, the special master met  with OFAC ex parte three times in the \nsummer of 2021.  There \u2019s support for that at DI 348 paragraphs 39 and 40.  On \nNovember 8, 2021, we  had . . . a hearing that was longer than  today\u2019 s hearing, a nd \namong other things we  discussed  [was] that the special master would  communicate \nwith OFAC ex parte, as he previously had done.  There was no reference to  potential \ndisqualification of the special  master or grounds for seeking his  disqualification, \neven though also on the  agenda that day was a motion to disqualify one  of the \nadvisors to the special master.   The transcript of . . . that whole proceeding . . . is at \nDI 409.  In my March 2022 opinion, DI 443 particularly at page 17, I noted that the sale procedure [s] order I would adopt would include a six -month window and during \nthe six -month window, the special master w [ould]  be directed to use his best efforts \nto obtain guidance from OFAC, making no mention that such meetings would be anything other than e x parte, as all such meetings up to that point had been. \n I then entered the sale procedure [s] order [i]n October 2022 and expressly \ncontemplated [that] the special master [would] proactively engag[e] with OFAC  \nand included that six- month window.  \u201cWithin six months\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m adding some \nwords to the quote \u2013 \u201che shall solicit and attempt to gain clarity and guidance from \nOFAC . . . of its support for or not opposition to the launch of the marketing \nprocess.\u201d  You can see these provisions at DI 481  . . . paragr aphs 3 and 4.[\n6] \n \n \n6 The full quote ( D.I. 481 \u00b6 3) reads,  \u201cWithin the period of six (6) months after the date of this \nOrder (the \u2018 Six-Month Window \u2019), the Special Master and his Advisors shall solicit and attempt \nto gain clarity or guidance from the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asse ts Control ( \u2018OFAC\u2019 ) of its support for (or non -opposition to), the launch of the \nMarketing Process by the Special Master, the viability of the Marketing Process, and any additional feedback or guidance that the Special Master believes will more likely resu lt in a \nvalue -maximizing Sale Transaction.\u201d  \n 4 \n In the status report of October 4, 2022, the special master confirmed he d [id] not \nintend to include the Venezuela parties at such a meeting.  That\u2019s DI 480 at [2] , \nnote [2].  There \u2019s no indication anywhere in the sale procedure [s] order that the \nspecial master \u2019s communications with OFAC needed to include any other parties, \nand there was no reason for any  sales process party to believe that they would be \ninvolved or invited to attend the meeting. \n Let me say something about advocacy.  I think when the special master used this word in this context, . . . he meant, as his counsel explained today, that he conveyed \nto OFAC his view that in order to conduct a value -maximizing transaction, which \nin his view is in the interest of all partie s, he, the special master, and ultimately the \nCourt [,] needs clarity from the U.S. government as to whether it will or will not or \nmay exercise its sole authority at the end of the process to grant a specific license, a license which will be required under  the current sanctions regime before a sale \ntransaction can be consummated.  That\u2019s what I think he meant by \u201cadvocacy.\u201d  \n I don\u2019 t think \u201cadvocacy\u201d is really the right word for that, but whatever word he \nused, the moving parties have not proven that it was materially different than the types of things the special master did at the earlier ex parte meetings with OFAC, nor have the moving parties persuaded me that there\u2019s anything wrong with what the special master did, whether we call it advocacy or something  else.  Which, by \nthe way, everything he did, he did at my express direction.  I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind the context here.  \n As Crystallex emphasized in argument today, while we do have certain views of  \nthe United States government on what \u2019s going on in this process, they\u2019re somewhat \noutdated, and they\u2019re expressly time bound.  So in July 2020,[\n7] we received the \nstatement of interest on behalf of the United States government stating a preference \nthat the Court halt the prefatory steps it was taking towards the sale.  As is entirely \nunderstandable and reasonable, that position was the position of the United States \ngovernment, quote, at that time.  It may well still be the position of the United States  \ngovernment, but in my view, there \u2019s absolute ly nothing improper about inquiring \nas to whether  it\u2019s still their view.   It\u2019s not advocacy.  There \u2019s nothing improper \nabout it.  \n \nSimilarly, the denial without prejudice  that Crystallex . . . [ received] for a specific \nlicense was based on, as it had to be, circumstances at  that time, and I believe the \nletter expressly  notes that it\u2019s a denial without prejudice to ask again . . . .[8] \n \n7 See D.I. 212 at 9 . \n \n8 D.I. 346 Ex. 1 at 5 (\u201c[T]he denial is without prejudice to reconsideration at a later time if the \nforeign policy considerations change.  As noted above, the United States anticipates that it will reassess whether the sale of the PDVH shares as requested b y Crystallex is consistent with U.S. \nforeign policy as the situation in Venezuela evolves.\u201d) . \n 5 \n The government \u2019s position could change at any time, and, very importantly, . . . I \nentirely respect and understand that u nless the current sanctions regime is changed, \nit will be for the executive branch and only the executive branch to ultimately \ndecide whether to grant the license or licenses necessary for a sales transaction to be completed and for the Court\u2019s judgment to  eventually be enforced.  That is up \nto them.  Nothing a special master says or anything I say or do will change that.  And I think everything that the special master does or says or has done or said has to be understood in that context.  \n . . .  So that was a lengthy side note on what are we talking about when we say \n\u201cadvocacy,\u201d but I still am trying to articulate why I think  the motion to disqualify \nthe special master was untimely.  And the first point for that is I do  think everything \nthat occurred  since at least  May of 2021 is relevant to understanding the  tim[eliness] \n[of the disqualification motion].  \n But I now want to say in the alternative, [that] if you wipe all of that away and only \nlook at  what happened from December 28, 2022,[\n9] to the  filing of the motion in \nfront of me today on January 23, 2023,[10] . . . I still think the motion, as an  \nalternative basis for my ruling, is untimely and sufficiently untimely that it is denied on that basis as well.  I do view the facts of what happened in l ate December and \nearly January of this year as, essentially, undisputed at this point.  By December 28th of last year, the Venezuela parties knew that the  special master would meet \nwith OFAC sometime in January and knew that the special master had not \ncoordinated with them,  [or] asked about their schedule, to figure out what day in \nJanuary they should meet. \n [The special master] . . . didn\u2019 t even contact them about setting up the  meeting with \nOFAC, and so by December 28th, particularly given the pattern of the special \nmaster\u2019s meetings with OFAC being ex parte and the sale procedures order not \ndoing anything to change that, I think by December 28th, the Venezuela parties had \nactual  knowledge that there would be a meeting in January and it would be ex parte \nbetween the special master and [OFAC].  If the Venezuela parties really believed \nthat that was going to be grounds, ultimately, for disqualification of the special \n \n9 See D.I. 495 at 2 (Special Master\u2019s Monthly Report, filed December 28, 2022, stating that \nSpecial Master \u201c[c]oordinated regarding a meeting with representatives of the United States Department of the Treasury and the United States Department of Justice to take place in January\u201d and \u201c[m]et with [his] Advisors regarding outreach to and negotiations with OFAC\u201d) . \n \n10 The motion is timestamped as having been filed on Friday, January 20, 2023.  However, as it \nwas filed after 5:00 p.m. that day, it is not considered to have been filed until M onday, January \n23, 2023, pursuant to this District\u2019s Revised Administrative Procedures Governing Filing and Service b y Electronic Means \u00a7 (F).  \n 6 \n master, a speci al master on whom, as we\u2019ve heard today, they [have]  spent a lot of \nmoney on and I, of course, [have] spent a lot of time giving assignments to and \nhav[e]  vested my authority in, if they really thought that was going to be meritorious \ngrounds for disqualif ying the special master, I think that\u2019s an emergency that \nrequires contacting the Court or doing your level  best to contact the Court within a \nday, two days maybe, three days at most.  \n \nI\u2019m not saying that you necessarily have to have fully coordinated amongst . . . \nyourselves and have written a nice brief, but if you think you\u2019 re in good faith sitting \non an issue that could mandatorily require me to disqualify the special master, I don\u2019t think you can wait from December 28th until January 9th without even contacting the Court and giving it a hint that there is this kind of emergency.  \n Of course, at that point [December 28th] , January was  undefined.  There was no \nspecific date, . . . so [January] could  have meant . . . maybe  January 3rd.  I just don\u2019t \nthink you can sit on that kind of an issue for that many days without even contacting the Court.  \n Time went on.  On December 30th, the special master let the Venezuela parties know a meeting was scheduled for January 12th specifically.[\n11]  Again, they knew \nor absolutely should have known, based on the pattern and practice and sale \nprocedures order, that that meeting would be ex parte, and that was expressly \nconfirmed on January 3rd,[12] and it was also on January 3rd, evidently, that the \nfirst use of the word \u201cad vocate\u201d came up, although I think that [it] should have been \nunderstood from at least December 28th, if not well before that.  \n Anyway, even if \u2013 and I don\u2019t think this is the best way to see it \u2013 even if the clock \nstarted ticking only on January 3rd, you c an\u2019t wait from January 3rd until January \n9th to contact the Court if you want to seek relief that becomes moot on January 11th or the morning of January 12th, particularly when the stakes are this high[,]   \n. . . this much money has been spent on the specia l master,  [and]  this much litigation \nhas gone into directing the special master [about] what to do.  \n \nAt best for the Venezuela parties, they knew a meeting was scheduled to occur . . . \nfor 13 days and they let 10 of those days lapse before contacting the C ourt or \nseeking any relief.  They took up 10 of 13 days, which by my calculation is 77 percent of the potential time I had to hear about the dispute, get briefing on it, \nreview the briefing, analyze the issue, make a decision, and articulate the decision.  \n \nI recognize there\u2019s not a lot of case law, if any, that says waiting a matter of days makes a motion to disqualify untimely, but I do think the circumstances here are, perhaps, unique and extreme enough that the pace at which the Venezuela parties \n \n11 D.I. 516 Ex. 1 at 2- 3. \n \n12 D.I. 516 \u00b6\u00b6 9- 10. 7 \n moved, e ven if I don\u2019t start the clock until December 28th, was simply too slow, \nand I would say substantially too slow.  I certainly don\u2019t believe that the Venezuela \nparties moved as swiftly as was reasonably practical.  And I do think in this context, the delay was substantial, as the Third Circuit cases require [,] for all the reasons \nI\u2019ve just explained.  \n And I also have reluctantly concluded that the delay was strategic; that is, I think the way the Venezuela parties have handled the issues relating to the OFAC  \nmeeting, the relief that they\u2019ve sought, first with respect to the meeting itself and now to disqualify the special master, I do believe it has . . . at least a substantial \nelement of being tactical and designed with at least a partial goal of further del aying \nthese proceedings.  \n As [Crystallex\u2019s counsel] observed[,] . . .  the argument that after the meeting the \nspecial master must mandatorily be disqualified because he is in possession of some otherwise undisclosed information, factual information on a di sputed issue, is at \nbest . . . hinted at in the briefing on the first motion.  There\u2019s no explicit reference to Section 455(b)(1), which is one of the significant bases for the disqualification \nmotion.  \n And I think no persuasive basis has been given for why the moving parties did not make a 455(b)(1) argument in their efforts to modify the meeting parameters, which leads me, again, reluctantly, to the conclusion that at least part of their motivation was to hold an argument in reserve to throw at the Court weeks after the meeting as a potential basis to compel the Court to disqualify [the ] special master.  \n And it probably goes without saying, but if I disqualify the special master, it will set back and further delay these already delayed proceedings, perhaps  by quite a \nlot, and . . . it may also lead and it may also have led, had I been persuaded to do \nthat, to an argument that I should be disqualified.  And while I\u2019m confident other judges could effectively, of course, preside over these actions, I have . . . years of \nexperience invested in [them]  now, and it would no doubt delay things substantially \nif we needed to [reassign] these matter to another judge.  \n So I think that all of that, that potential to really substantially slow down  these \nproceedings even further by going after  the special master , [and]  potentially asking \nto remove me, was at least part of what was going on in . . . the . . . duly delayed \ntiming of these motions.  \n All of the reasons that the motion directed to the meeting was untimely apply equally, if not more so, to the motion t o disqualify, which, of course, was not filed \nuntil January 23rd, a fter the [OFAC] meeting [had occurred].  It is, at least . . . as \nuntimely as the motion[] [regarding the] meeting itself.  That\u2019s all I ha[ve] to say about timeliness.  \n 8 \n As a further reason  for denying . . . the motion to disqualify, I do believe that the \nbases on which the Venezuela parties seek disqualification of the special master are \nwaived.  Really, the same analysis as to the timeliness [applies here].  Because the moving parties have  no evidence that the ex parte meeting on January 12th was \nmaterially different than all of the prior meetings [,] given the course of how we got \nto January 12th, I conclude that the Venezuela parties\u2019 long -time acquiescence in \nthe special master\u2019s ex parte engagement with OFAC, which was materially similar \nto what he had done repeatedly before, . . . also constitutes a waiver of their right to seek disqualification of the special master based on that meeting.[\n13] \n Further, just a little bit more on why the motion fails on the merits.  If the timing . \n. . and the waiver are not enough, I find that as, I\u2019ve already said, there\u2019s no[t] \nsufficient evidence to grant the motion.  Let me add to that.  Specifically under 455(a), I find the special master\u2019s and my impartiality cannot be reasonably \nquestioned.  A reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would not \nconclude that his or my impartiality might be reasonably questioned.  The Court \nhas authorized the ex parte meetings[,]  which the law permits me to d o.  The special \nmaster\u2019s opening brief opposing this motion [D.I. 512]  at pages 9 to 11 and the \nletter filed by ConocoPhillips, DI 522 at pages 3 to 4, set out how Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 and various cases applying that rule approve [d] of judges  \nauthorizing ex parte communications by a special master with the Court or a party.  That\u2019s the express language of Rule 53,[\n14] and that language has been \u2013 as \nexplained in those filings and in the cases cited [ \u2013] . . . interpreted to include the \nCourt\u2019s ability to authorize ex parte communications with third parties.  \n \nI am persuaded that these authorities make my order lawful and that the challenging \nfacts and circumstances I am confronting in this case make my order reasonable and necessary.  There is no thing improper or anything a reasonable person would \nthink improper in the special master assisting the Court in its efforts to enforce judgments that have been entered and affirmed, and no reasonable person would think that there is anything improper or giving rise to a reasonable basis to question impartiality in using the special master in this way and in him following my \ndirection to do so. \n \nIn addition to Rule 53, the Court does have  . . . inherent power to enforce its own \njudgment [s] and to issue orders as necessary to make its judgments effective.  That \n \n13 See In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd. , 353 F.3d 211, 220- 21 (3d Cir. 2003) (explaining that \ndisqualification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) \u201cmay be waived by the parties\u201d although \u201cthe grounds \nfor disqualification under \u00a7 455(b)(1) generally  cannot be waived\u201d) . \n \n14 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(b)(2)(B)  (providing that order appointing special master must state \u201cthe \ncircumstances, if any, in which the master may communicate ex parte with the court or a party\u201d).  \n 9 \n proposition is supported in many places, but among others, in the Peacock decision \nof the Supreme Court[,15] 516 U.S. at 356. \n As for the  455(b) grounds, the special master does not, nor do I, have any personal \nknowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding, which is what must be shown and has not been shown for disqualification under 455(b).  \n There is not and will not be  any dispute as to what OFAC\u2019s position is.  We\u2019re not \ngoing to litigate that.  OFAC will tell us its position or it won\u2019t tell us its position, and we will all accept that [a] s their position or [that] they\u2019re not going to tell us \nwhat their position is. . . .  It\u2019s not a factual dispute over an evidentiary fact \nconcerning this proceeding that the rule is concerned with.  \n So for all of those reasons, my decision is to deny the motion to disqualify. \n   \n________________________________ \n      HONORABLE LEONARD P.
