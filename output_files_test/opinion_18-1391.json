Andrews", "date": "04-11-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE \nINGEVITY CORPORATION and \nINGEVITY SOUTH CAROLINA, LLC, \nPlaintiffs/Counter-Defendants, \nV. \nBASF CORPORATION , \nDefendant/Counter-Plaintiff. Civil Action No. 18-1391-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nPlaintiffs Ingevity Corporation and Ingevity South Carolina, LLC (collectively, \n\"Ingevity\") filed a patent case against Defendant BASF, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. \nRE38,844 \"(the '844 Patent\"). (D.I. 1). The '844 Patent claimed a technology for reducing \nevaporative emissions. (Id.). On November 17, 2020, I invalidated all asserted claims of the '844 \nPatent based on prior invention. (D.I. 419 at 14).1 \nBASF had filed counterclaims. BASF alleged that Ingevity: (1) unlawfully leveraged, or \ntied, the '844 Patent by requiring customers wishing to license the patent to also purchase \nunpatented carbon honeycombs from Ingevity; (2) unlawfully restrained competition by entering \ninto exclusive supply agreements with Delphi, KFTC, and Kayser; and (3) tortiously interfered \nwith a prospective business relationship between BASF and Kayser. (D.I. 65 at 16-37; D.I. 525 at \n2; D.I. 549 at 12). The parties filed and briefed cross-motions for summary judgment. (D.I. 440, \n441, 443, 444, 455, 456, 468, 470). Ingevity argued that its carbon honeycombs were non-staple \n1 The Federal Circuit later affirmed a related ITC decision. See Ingevity Corp. v. ITC, 2021 WL \n3440786 (Fed. Cir. July 21, 2021). \n1 articles of commerce, such that Ingevity had the right to control the market for such honeycombs \n(D .I. 441 at 6-15), and that its alleged anticompetitive conduct was immune from liability under \nthe patent laws and the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. (Id. at 15-20). I denied both summary judgment \nmotions. (D.I. 525). I decided that BASF's tying claim involved a question of fact as to whether \nIngevity's carbon honeycombs were staple articles of commerce. (Id. at 2-3). I said that I would \ndecide the Noerr-Pennington issues, but that my decision \"must await hearing the evidence at \ntrial.\" (Id. at 4-5). I noted that \"the Noerr-Pennington doctrine will [likely not] help Ingevity if \nBASF proves the Ingevity product that competes with the EvapTrap XC is a staple article of \ncommerce. \" (Id. at 5). \nThe staple article of commerce question was incorporated in Final Jury Instruction 4.2, \nwhich provided, \"BASF bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the \ncarbon honeycombs at issue are staple goods and therefore beyond the scope of Ingevity's right to \nexclude.\" (D.I. 549 at 17; D.I. 570 at 1316). I further instructed that if the jury determined that \nBASF had not met this burden, then the jury \"must find for Ingevity on the tying and tortious \ninterference claims.\" (D.I. 549 at 17; D.I. 570 at 1316). The parties also jointly requested and \nreceived a jury instruction on Noerr-Pennington and patent-enforcement immunity. (See D.I. 545 \nat 24-25). That instruction -Final Jury Instruction 4.1-was provided to the jury in writing and \norally. It read as follows: \n4.1 COMMON IMMUNITY -PATENT ENFORCEMENT AND THE \nEXERCISE OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS \nIngevity has the right under the patent laws to enforce its patents, including through \nlicensing, through communications about its patent rights to customers and competitors , \nand through litigation. Additionally , Ingevity has the right under the first amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution to file a lawsuit, to threaten litigation, and to communicate with \ncustomers about litigation. Evidence of the exercise of such rights cannot form the basis \nfor BASF's antitrust claims or BASF's tortious interference claim. \n2 However , Ingevity has no right to engage in conduct, such as tying or exclusive \ndealing, that unlawfully restricts competition beyond the scope of the patent monopoly , \nand such conduct can form the basis for BASF' s antitrust claims and its tortious \ninterference claim. \n(D.I. 549 at 16; D.I. 570 at 1315).2 \nThe jury returned a verdict finding that BASF proved by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat (1) Ingevity unlawfully tied licenses to the '844 Patent to sales of Ingevity's carbon \nhoneycombs ; (2) Ingevity engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing; and (3) Ingevity knew about and \nunlawfully interfered with a prospective business relationship between BASF and Kayser. (D.I. \n553 at 1-2). Following the jury's verdict, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law on the immunity issues. (D.I. 575, 576, 577). I have considered the parties' \nbriefing. For the reasons set forth below, I find that neither the Noerr-Pennington doctrine nor the \npatent laws immunize Ingevity's conduct. \nThe key question here is whether the jury implicitly found facts that are fatal to Ingevity's \nimmunity defenses. I agree with BASF that, \"in finding Ingevity liable for tying, exclusive dealing, \nand tortious interference , the jury implicitly and necessarily found that BASF had proven that the \nhoneycombs at issue were a staple good with substantial noninfringing uses.\" (D.I. 575 at 5). The \nlogic is straightforward. The jury was instructed to find for Ingevity if BASF failed to meet its \nburden on the staple article of commerce question. (D.I. 549 at 17). As the jury did not find for \nIngevity (D.I. 553), the jury must have found that BASF met its burden. \n2 Both parties requested the first paragraph. Only BASF requested the second paragraph . \nIngevity's written objections to the second paragraph led with its being \"repetitive, ... \nargumentative , confusing , and unnecessary. \" (D.I. 545 at 24-25). Ingevity did not make or renew \nany objections to Final Jury Instruction 4.1 when the instructions were being finalized. (See D.I. \n569 at 1245-95). \n3 Ingevity does not dispute that the jury implicitly found that its honeycombs were staple \ngoods.3 In Ingevity's view, however, this finding is irrelevant. (D.I. 576 at 1). Ingevity maintains \nthat its immunity defenses do not depend on any staple article finding by the jury, as the staple \narticle question \"is separate from Ingevity's First Amendment and patent law immunity defenses.\" \n(Id at 8-9). \"[T]he accused tying conduct,\" says Ingevity, \"is in fact an exercise of First \nAmendment and patent rights\" (id at 3), as BASF's evidence regarding that conduct \"shows \nnothing more than that Ingevity communicated to customers what does and does not infringe the \n'844 Patent,\" which is a protected exercise of such rights. (Id at 2). \nThe trouble with Ingevity's argument is that the jury found otherwise . Jury Instruction 4.1 \nprovided that Ingevity has a right under the patent laws \"to enforce its patents . . . through \ncommunications about its patent rights to customers and competitors , and through litigation,\" as \nwell as a First Amendment right \"to file a lawsuit, to threaten litigation, and to communicate with \ncustomers about litigation. \" (D.I. 549 at 16). The jury was instructed , \"Evidence of the exercise of \nsuch rights cannot form the basis for BASF's antitrust claims or BASF's tortious interference \nclaim.\" (D.I. 549 at 16). In other words, the jury was \"instructed that it could not find illegal tying \nif Ingevity' s conduct was limited to 'communications about its patent rights to customers .'\" (D .I. \n577 at 3 (quoting D.I. 549 at 16)). Again, the logic is straightforward. The jury found tying (D.I. \n553); thus, the jury also found that the conduct upon which the jury based its finding was not \nlimited to protected communications about its patent rights to customers. I therefore disagree with \nIngevity's assertion that \"the jury was not asked to decide ... the immunity questions now before \n3 Ingevity indicates that it will seek to show in a forthcoming motion that the jury's staple article \nfinding \"was not supported by substantial evidence, or at a minimum was against the great weight \nof the evidence.\" (D.I. 576 at 1). \n4 the Court,\" such as \"whether the conduct at issue ... was petitioning activity or an immune exercise \nof patent rights.\" (D.I. 576 at 8). \nNeither am I convinced by Ingevity's argument that the jury's findings are irrelevant \nbecause the parties agreed that I-and not the jury-would decide the instant immunity questions . \n(Id.). As I noted in my order on the summary judgment motions (D.I. 525 at 4), the parties appeared \nto have reached such an agreement prior to the pretrial conference. (See D.I. 496 at 15 n.3 (\"BASF \nand Ingevity agree that the determination of whether conduct amounts to patent enforcement or \npetitioning activity that is therefore immune under the patent laws and/or the Noerr-Pennington \ndoctrine is a question of law for the Court, but include the issue here in case the Court disagrees \nand determines the matter is a question of fact for the jury.\")).4 The parties did not, however, agree \nthat I would decide every subsidiary factual issue that bears on immunity . For example, at the \npretrial conference , BASF clarified that although it would be helpful for me to resolve the \nimmunity issues as a matter of law, \"there may be subsidiary factual issues that wind up being \ntried before the jury.\" (D.I. 521 at 8). \nIngevity's position was less clear. Although Ingevity indicated its preference for me to \n\"hear the evidence in the case and then decide [the immunity questions] ... and not give that to the \njury\" (id. at 7), Ingevity also appeared to agree with BASF that the jury should decide related \nfactual issues. (See id. at 13 (\"[Y]ou might instruct the jury that certain activities that they've \nidentified as being improper ... are protected and Ingevity has a right to do X, Y, Z .... \")). At trial, \nIngevity did not object to Jury Instruction 4.1. Indeed, when asked about that instruction during \n4 At the time of the pretrial order, the parties filed requested final jury instructions. (D.I. 496). The \nparties continued to work on resolving disputes on that subject. After four days of trial, the parties \nfiled revised requested final jury instructions. (D.I. 545). At the end of the fifth day of trial, the \nCourt and the parties discussed the jury instructions at the prayer conference . (D.I. 569 at 1245-\n95). Thereafter , the Court filed the final jury instructions. (D.I. 549). \n5 the \"prayer conference,\"5 Ingevity seemed to suggest that the instruction reflected Ingevity's own \ntheory that its Noerr-Pennington and patent law immunity defenses are independent of the staple \ngood issue. (See D.I. 569 at 1282-83). Ingevity also confirmed during the prayer conference that \nit wanted the jury to decide factual issues bearing on the immunity questions. \"[The Court]: So \nbasically you're wanting to ask [on the verdict form 'whether the good is staple'] for -not really \nfor what the jury is being directly asked to decide, but as a sort of factual finding that I would then \ndo something with if necessary afterwards? [Counsel for Ingevity] : I believe that's correct.\" (Id. \nat 1284 (bracketed quote at 1283)). \nIn sum, counter to Ingevity's contentions (see D.I. 572 at 4-6), nothing in the record \namounts to a waiver by BASF of its demand for a jury trial such that the jury's findings as to \"any \nfactual issues relevant to the immunity defenses\" were merely \"advisory.\" (Id. at 6). \"Given that a \ncourt must indulge every reasonable presumption against a finding of waiver, ambiguity should be \nresolved against inferring waiver.\" Cabinet Vision v. Cabnetware , 129 F.3d 595, 601 (Fed. Cir. \n1997). I do not think that Ingevity should receive another bite at the apple by relitigating facts that \nthe jury, at Ingevity 's request, has already decided. See Everett H ex rel. Havey v. Dry Creek Joint \nElem. Sch. Dist., 2018 WL 3655886, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. July 31, 2018) (rejecting plaintiffs ' demand \nthat the court \"issue findings of fact and conclusions of law that run counter to the jury's findings\" \nin a case \"already decided by the jury at Plaintiffs ' request\") . \n5 This is a term used in Delaware. See Lolley v. State, 132 A.3d 1160 (Table), 2016 WL 446736, \nat* 1 (Del. Feb. 4, 2016) (Chief Justice Seitz). I have the impression it is not widely used elsewhere. \n6 Thus, for the reasons discussed above, I conclude that neither the Noerr-Pennington \ndoctrine nor the patent laws immunize Ingevity's conduct. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n~ \nEntered this 11 day of April, 2023. \n7 "}
