Fallon", "date": "04-14-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nMARQUINEZ et al., )\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civil Action No. 12-cv-695-RGA-SRF\nDOLE FOOD COMPANY INC. et al., 5\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nAt Wilmington this 14th day of April, 2023, the court having considered the parties\u2019\nsubmissions regarding Luis Antonio Aguilar Marquinez, et al. (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) Motion to Allocate\nin Whole or in Part the Court Appointed Expert Witness Costs (\u201cMotion\u201d), (D.I. 419), IT IS\nHEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is DENIED for the reasons discussed below:\n\n1. Background.\u201d This motion concems the allocation of costs for a court appointed\nexpert witness on Ecuadorian law. In Chavez and Marquinez, motions for summary judgment\n\nwere filed in the mass toxic tort case by the participating Defendants\u2019 concerning the Ecuadorian\n\n' The briefing for the pending Motion is as follows: Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion and opening brief (D.I.\n419), Defendants\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 426), and Plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief (D.I. 429). In addition,\nthe expert witness, Professor Angel R. Oquendo, submitted a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion.\n(D.I. 427)\n\n2 This case was consolidated with eight other cases pending in this district and was designated as\nlead on December 5, 2019. (D.I. 195; see No. 12-695-RGA-SRF; No. 12-696-RGA; No. 12-\n697-RGA-SRF; No. 12-698-RGA; No. 12-699-RGA; No. 12-700-RGA; No. 12-701-RGA; and\nNo. 12-702-RGA) This case and Chavez et al. v. Dole Food Company, Inc., et al, No. 12-697-\nRGA-SRF are relevant to the present Motion as they concern the Ecuadorian Plaintiffs.\n\n3 Participating Defendants include: (1) Dole Food Co. Inc., Dole Fresh Fruit Co., Standard Fruit\nCompany, and Standard Fruit and Steamship Company, who filed for summary judgment in\nChavez (D.I. 333); (2) Dow Chemical Company, Occidental Chemical Corp., AMVAC Chemical\nCorp., and Shell Oil Co., who filed for summary judgment in Marquinez (D.1. 354); and (3)\nChiquita Brands Int\u2019! Inc., Chiquita Fresh N. Am. LLC, and Chiquita Brands LLC, who joined in\nthe aforementioned summary judgment motions (D.I. 355). Defendant Del Monte Fresh Produce\nN.A. Inc. is not a participating Defendant for purposes of this Motion. (D.I. 426 at 1 n.1)\nPlaintiffs who claim to have been injured as a result of alleged exposure to an agricultural\nchemical called dibromochloropropane (\u201cDBCP\u201d) while working on banana farms. (D.I. 333;\nD.L 354; see D.I. 1 at J] 5, 104-05) The Ecuadorian Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary\njudgment. (D.I. 339) The summary judgment motions contained conflicting expert declarations\nregarding the application of Ecuadorian law. (D.I. 341; D.I. 356-1, Ex. B; D.I. 360-2, Ex. 2)\n\n2. On August 5, 2021, the Honorable Richard G. Andrews ordered the parties to\nmeet and confer and nominate an expert to assist the court in answering whether a protection\naction under Ecuadorian constitutional law is an appropriate mechanism for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n(D.I. 383) The parties recommended Professor Angel R. Oquendo. (D.I. 387) The court\nrequired a neutral expert to resolve the conflict between both sides\u2019 experts on (1) whether a\nplaintiff could bring a protection action for events that occurred prior to 2008, the date the\nEcuadorian Constitution was adopted, and (2) whether Plaintiffs\u2019 claims could appropriately be\nbrought as a protection action. (D.I. 388 at 2) The court appointed Professor Oquendo and\ntasked him \u201cto opine on matters of Ecuadorian law relevant to the applicability of the Delaware\nBorrowing Statute.\u201d (D.I. 389 at J 1)\n\n3. The court ordered the parties to compensate Professor Oquendo as follows:\n\nProfessor Oquendo shall be compensated for his services at his usual hourly rate. Others\n\nassisting him shall be compensated at their usual hourly rates. Professor Oquendo shall\n\nsend itemized statements for services and expenses directly to counsel for the parties after\nthe completion of his report, and he shall receive payment directly from counsel for the\nparties in a timely fashion. The compensation and expenses of Professor Oquendo shall,\nunless otherwise ordered, be shared equally by the parties (that is, 50% by Plaintiffs and\n\n50% by the relevant Defendants). Any objections or disputes as to Professor Oquendo\u2019s\n\ncompensation, costs, and/or expenses shall be presented to the Court in a timely\n\napplication.\n\n(Id. at | 5 (emphasis added))\n4. On December 14, 2021, Professor Oquendo submitted his report. (D.I. 393)\nDefendants then desired to depose Professor Oquendo. (D.I. 396) On January 21, 2022, the\ncourt ordered that Defendants should bear one hundred percent of the cost for the deposition\nunless Plaintiffs questioned Professor Oquendo \u201cmore than a de minimis amount,\u201d in which\nDefendants could move to seek a proportionate contribution from the Plaintiffs. (D.I. 398)\n\n5. More than eight months after issuing his expert report, Professor Oquendo was\nstill owed Plaintiffs\u2019 half of his expert witness fees. Therefore, on August 19, 2022, the court\nissued a Show Cause Order requiring the Plaintiffs to demonstrate why they should not be\nsanctioned for withholding their fifty percent share. (D.I. 411) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded\nthat they had good cause to withhold payment because they intended to challenge Professor\nOquendo\u2019s fees but did not want to do so until after his expert deposition so as not to risk biasing\nProfessor Oquendo against Plaintiffs in offering his opinion on highly contested legal questions.\n(I. 414)\n\n6. Professor Oquendo\u2019s deposition took place on September 19, 2022. (D.I. 426, Ex.\nA) On September 30, 2022, the court held the Show Cause Hearing, and the Plaintiffs deposited\ntheir fifty percent share, which totaled $168,898.00, with the court. (D.I. 416; see also docket\nentry dated October 13, 2022) On October 14, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed the present Motion and\n\nthe court discharged the Show Cause Order. (D.I. 418; D.I. 419)\n\n4 Defendants say the Plaintiffs spent more than a de minimus amount of time questioning the\nexpert, about 18% of the deposition time, but Defendants have not moved for contribution from\nPlaintiffs towards the deposition fees charged by Professor Oquendo. (D.I. 426 at 5 n.7; see D.L.\n398)\n7. Legal Standard. Pursuant to the Federal Rule of Evidence 706(c)(2), a court\nappointed expert witness \u201cis entitled to a reasonable compensation, as set by the court. This\ncompensation is payable . . . by the parties in the proportion and at the time that the court\ndirects\u2014and the compensation is then charged like other costs.\u201d\n\n8. Plaintiffs now move to shift the entire expense of the court appointed expert\u2019s\nreport to the Defendants. Plaintiffs\u2019 rationale is that the Defendants were the \u201cprime movers\u201d\ncreating the need for the expert\u2019s opinion because Defendants disputed whether Plaintiffs could\nbring a protection action. (D.J. 419 at 2-6) Plaintiffs contend that the expert supports their\nposition, therefore, it was a needless expense for resolving an issue that should not have been\nchallenged. (/d.) In addition, the Plaintiffs claim they are indigent, and the Defendants have\ngreater resources, so it is not unreasonable for the Defendants to bear the full expense for the\nexpert\u2019s report. (/d. at 4-5) Alternatively, Plaintiffs ask the court to reduce the fees charged by\nthe expert. (/d. at 6-7) The court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on all grounds as discussed, infra.\n\n9. The Expert\u2019s Opinions Were Necessary to Assist the Court. The Plaintiffs\nargue that the Defendants should bear the entire cost of Professor Oquendo\u2019s fees because the\nDefendants\u2019 litigation position, that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were time barred, inter alia, caused the\nneed for the expert\u2019s report. (D.I. 419 at 2-6) Moreover, the ultimate opinions offered by the\nexpert favored Plaintiffs\u2019 position on the disputed issues of Ecuadorian law. (/d.) Plaintiffs\nargue that shifting the cost is appropriate and tracks the rationale for the court\u2019s order that\nDefendants pay the full cost of the expert\u2019s deposition. (Jd. at 3)\n\n10. The court is not persuaded by the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Defendants should\nbear the entire cost because they unreasonably took a position that necessitated the court\u2019s\n\nretention of the expert. The case on which Plaintiffs rely does not support their position for cost-\nshifting based on unfavorable outcome and instead supports the court\u2019s original equal\napportionment. (See D.I. 419 at 5) See Leesona Corp. v. Varta Batteries, Inc., 522 F. Supp.\n1304, 1312 n.21 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (noting that the court appointed expert was \u201cpaid in equal\nshares by plaintiff and defendant\u201d).\n\n11. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defendants caused the parties to incur an unnecessary\nexpense for the expert fails to acknowledge that Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in both\nthe Marquinez and Chavez cases, thus, a conflict in application of Ecuadorian law was presented\nfor which the court required an expert. The court needed to identify the applicable statute of\nlimitations for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Ecuadorian law in order to apply the Delaware Borrowing\nStatute. Due to both sides\u2019 conflicting interpretation of Ecuadorian law, the court acted within\nits discretion under Rule 706 to appoint a neutral expert and apportion the expense between the\nparties.\n\n12. Defendants complied with the court\u2019s Order assessing them with the total cost of\nthe expert\u2019s deposition because Defendants noticed the deposition. (D.I. 410) Defendants\u2019\npayment has no bearing on Plaintiffs\u2019 compliance with their obligations under the court\u2019s\noriginal order apportioning expenses for the expert\u2019s report.\n\n13. Furthermore, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that expert witness fees should be assessed\nagainst the side the opinion allegedly disfavors is unpersuasive and lacks any authority\nemploying such a calculation based on hindsight. Professor Oquendo provided his expert\nopinion, and it remains for the court to determine how it affects the viability of the Ecuadorian\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n14. Plaintiffs Failed to Demonstrate that Payment of their Share of Fees for the\nExpert Would Pose an Undue Burden. The Plaintiffs argue that they are \u201cimpecunious,\u201d so\njustice requires shifting costs to the Defendant corporations which \u201chave far more resources to\nbear this expense.\u201d (D.I. 419 at 4-5) Plaintiffs briefly argue that the cost \u201cplac[es] a substantial\nburden on Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s resources to prosecute this litigation.\u201d (/d. at 6 n.3; see also D.I.\n429 at 4) The court will not entertain arguments placed in a footnote nor will it infer that a\nfinancial hardship is present without supporting evidence. Plaintiffs have already deposited their\nfifty percent share of Professor Oquendo\u2019s fees with the court, so they have demonstrated their\nability to pay their allocated share.\n\n15. When the court entered an Order allocating the costs of the expert to be \u201cshared\nequally by the parties,\u201d it left open the opportunity to raise \u201c[a]ny objections or disputes as to\nProfessor Oquendo\u2019s compensation . . . in a timely application.\u201d (D.I. 389 at ] 5) Plaintiffs did\nnot voice concern that allocating them with an equal share of the expense would be unduly\nburdensome or constrain their ability to litigate their case. Further, Plaintiffs did not object to the\nallocation, nor did they ask to defer allocation until the expert issued his opinion. The Plaintiffs\nhave long been on notice of the court\u2019s allocation of the fees. They chose to avoid paying their\nshare until the court resorted to a Show Cause Order and finally ordered them to deposit their\nshare with the court. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to re-allocate the cost based on financial\nburden is unpersuasive.\n\n16. The court also finds that Plaintiffs have failed to support their cost-shifting\nargument with binding authority from the Third Circuit. The cases cited by Plaintiffs are from\ncourts outside of this circuit and do not address re-apportionment of costs for the court appointed\n\nexpert once the court has ordered an equal allocation. (See D.I. 419 at 3-5) The cases that\nPlaintiffs cite are distinguishable in that they involve court appointed medical experts to render\nopinions on injuries alleged by prisoners in civil rights actions. See e.g., Claiborne v. Blauser,\n934 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2019) (discussing Rule 706 in the context of a court appointed\nmedical expert in a prisoner\u2019s civil rights action); Ledford v. Sullivan, 105 F.3d 354, 359-60 (7th\nCir. 1997) (affirming the district court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiff's request to appoint a\ncourt expert to opine on the plaintiff's medical condition in a civil rights action); McKinney v.\nAnderson, 924 F.2d 1500, 1510-11 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. granted, judgment vacated on other\ngrounds, 502 U.S. 903 (1991), on remand, judgment reinstated, 959 F.2d 853, 854 (9th Cir.\n1992) (recommending that the district court appoint an expert witness to opine on the health\neffects and concentration levels of secondary cigarette smoke in the prisoner\u2019s civil rights\naction). These cases are inapplicable to the present situation because, in prisoner civil rights\ncases, medical experts are necessary for the indigent plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of proof on\ndamages. Such is not the case here regarding Professor Oquendo\u2019s expert opinion on Ecuadorian\nlaw.\n\n17. The Court Finds the Expert Witness Fees are Reasonable. Alternatively, the\nPlaintiffs move for a reduction of the fees billed by Professor Oquendo and his assistant, Claudia\nSchubert, because the hours billed for preparing the report are excessive and unreasonable. (D.I.\n419 at 6-7) Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the court should evaluate the expert\u2019s fees by the\nsame standard it applies to the fees charged by a Special Master. (Jd. at 7)\n\n18. Fees billed by Special Masters bear no relationship to fees billed by a court\nappointed expert because Special Masters are not subject to Rule 706. It remains within the\ncourt\u2019s discretion to allocate costs for a court appointed expert. Moreover, the role of a Special\n\nMaster is akin to that of a judicial officer not an expert witness. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument ignores the\ndistinction and lacks any supporting authority.\n\n19. Professor Oquendo and Schubert billed the parties $337,796 for approximately\n432 hours of work during the months of October of 2021 through December of 2021, resulting in\ncompletion of a 30-page report. (D.I. 419, Ex. A; D.I. 393) The court asked Professor Oquendo\nto respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion challenging his expert witness fees. (D.I. 424) In his response,\nProfessor Oquendo explains that his report \u201cdelves deeper\u201d than the report of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert in\nopining on the issues in the pending case. (D.I. 427 at 1) Professor Oquendo did not pull up the\ncases on both sides of the issue and decide between them. Rather, \u201c[iJn pursuit of reliability for\n[the] assessment, [he and his assistant] stud[ied] the totality of [the issues] and develop[ed] an\nanalytic scheme.\u201d (Jd. at 2) In fact, Professor Oquendo could find no direct authority on point\naddressing the disputed issues for which he was retained. (D.I. 426, Ex. A at 133:21-134:17;\n195:23-196:14 (discussing that the Constitutional Court has not spoken on whether a protection\naction could be retroactively applied to conduct that occurred before the adoption of the\nEcuadorian Constitution)) Professor Oquendo states in his declaration that he worked on seven\nprior cases researching similar issues of Ecuadorian law, and in six of them he expended more\nhours than he did here. (D.I. 427 at 1)\n\n20. Plaintiffs questioned Professor Oquendo about the charges on his bill ina\nvideoconference specifically for that purpose and, later, at his deposition. (/d. at 4-5; D.I. 426,\nEx. A at 211:11-24) In their Motion, Plaintiffs fail to mention their questioning of Professor\nOquendo on either occasion. Plaintiffs fail to substantively respond to Professor Oquendo\u2019s\nexplanation in defense of his fees. Plaintiffs argue generally that the hours expended on the\nexpert report were unreasonable, but they provide no facts to support their position. Plaintiffs do\n\nnot suggest any analytic framework for auditing the reasonableness of the number of hours billed\nnor have they provided a declaration attesting to the hours reasonably necessary to provide the\nexpert report ordered by the court. Plaintiffs simply provide a comparison of the hours billed by\nProfessor Oquendo\u2019s team with the number of hours billed by the Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Maria\nMifio. (D.I. 419 at 6) Dr. Mifio billed a total of $7,500 for 25 hours of work to complete a 10-\npage report. (/d.) A superficial comparison of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s bill to the court appointed\nexpert\u2019s bill is a thin basis on which to avoid payment of their allocated share which the court\nappropriately ordered in the exercise of its discretion.\n\n21. Plaintiffs complain that Professor Oquendo addressed more issues than were\nnecessary compared to the issues addressed by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Mifio. (/d.) The argument\nmisses the point that Professor Oquendo was appointed by the court and his report conforms to\nthe scope of duties set by the court. Therefore, the court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to\ndemonstrate that the number of hours billed by Professor Oquendo and Schubert were\nunreasonable, and therefore, denies Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to reduce Professor Oquendo\u2019s bill for\nexpert witness fees.\n\n22. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is DENIED. (D.L\n419) An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue. Upon the expiration of\nthe deadline for objections, if any, or upon further Order of the court, the amount of $168,898.00\nshall be released by the court from the funds on deposit in full and final satisfaction of Plaintiffs\u2019\nshare of Professor Oquendo\u2019s fees.\n\n23. | This Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed.
