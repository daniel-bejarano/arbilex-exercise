No. 23-115-GBW\nSCOTT CERESINI, Warden, and :\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPetitioner is an inmate at the Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown,\nDelaware. He has filed a form application for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2241 (D.I. 1 at 1-8), a typed document titled \u201cPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d\n(\u201cPetition\u201d) (D.I. 1 at 9-17), and a document titled \u201cPoints and Authorities in\nSupport of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d (\u201cPetition\u201d). (D.I. 1-1) In the\nform application, Petitioner explains that he\n\nwas arrested on April 20, 2015 on assorted charges which\n\nincluded guns and drugs to which he had in his private\nvehicle while traveling on Interstate 95 through\nWilmington, Delaware. On 6-22-15, a True Bill of\nIndictment was handed down for Eric. B. Simmons with\nfirearms, drug, and traffic charges pursuant to Delaware\nUniform Controlled Substances Act under Title 16 of the\nDelaware Code; the National Firearms Act under\nDelaware Code Title 11; and Traffic charges on Delaware\nUniform Traffic Complaint and Summons under Delaware\nTitle 21.\n(DI. 1 at 9-10) Petitioner explains that, following a Superior Court jury trial on\nMay 10, 2017, the Superior Court sentenced him to ten years at Level V\nincarceration. (D.I. 1 at 10) It appears that Petitioner will be transferred to Iowa at\nthe completion of his Delaware sentence. See Simmons v. Akinbayo, 2018 WL\n3827149 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 6, 2018).\n\nPetitioner asserts that he \u201cis a private sentient man, a living being with a\nsoul, flesh, and blood, and not a \u2018subject\u2019 or \u2018citizen\u2019 of the U.S. government or\nDelaware state government.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 9) He contends that he is in custody in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the State of Delaware lacked\njurisdiction over his person. (See id.) Petitioner seeks immediate release from\ncustody, and explains that he has filed the instant habeas request under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2241 rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because\n\n\u00a7 2254 requires a state habeas petitioner to be in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a state court[. This]\ndescription [...] does not fit Petitioner\u2019s circumstances\nbecause the judgment is a nullity, a void judgment.\u201d!\n\n(DI. 1-1 at 1-2)\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\nof someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground\nthat his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Notably,\na district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \u201cif it plainly appears from\nthe face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not\nentitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\nI. DISCUSSION\nPetitioner invokes the so-called \u201cflesh and blood\u201d movement to avoid the\nconsequences of his state criminal convictions. As explained in a recent decision\nby the Western District of Pennsylvania,\n[a]dherents to the \u201cflesh and blood\u201d movement believe\nthat a person has two distinct versions of himself, a \u201cflesh-\n\nand-blood\u201d natural man and a legal person\u2014the vessel\n[also called a \u201cstrawman\u201d]. They theorize that the\n\n'Petitioner\u2019s justification for filing his petition under \u00a7 2241 lacks merit, because \u00a7\n2254 is the exclusive federal remedy when a petitioner challenges the validity of a\nstate criminal conviction and sentence. Nevertheless, since Petitioner\u2019s instant\nhabeas request is summarily dismissible regardless of the authority relied upon, the\nCourt will not address this error in more depth.\n\n3\ngovernment has power only over the strawman and not\n\nover the live person, who remains free. Therefore, the real\n\nperson can demand that government officials pay\n\nenormous sums of money to use the strawman's name or,\n\nin the case of prisoners, to keep him in custody. Courts\n\nhave routinely dismissed nonsensical claims of this nature\n\nas patently frivolous.\nEllis v. Philadelphia Cnty., 2022 WL 1491411, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 28, 2022)\n(collecting cases) (cleaned up).\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Petitioner\u2019s instant \u201cflesh and\nblood\u201d argument is frivolous and fails to provide a basis for habeas relief.\nTherefore, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition for failing to assert\nan issue cognizable on federal habeas review.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant\nPetition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because\nPetitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a\n\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United\n\nStates v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.\n\nDated: April (4 , 2023 Pa edb | (Md ,\nGREGORY B.
