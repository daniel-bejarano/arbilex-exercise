Before the Court is a motion to strike and dismiss filed by\nDefendants Days Inn Worldwide, Inc., Wyndham Worldwide, Inc., Wyndham\nHotel Group, LLC, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, LLC, Wyndham Hotels and\nResorts, Inc., and Wyndham Hotel Management, Inc. (the \u201cHotel Defendants\u201d)\n(D.I. 17); a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, filed by Defendants\nBeaufort County Sheriff's Office, Lyle E. Harris, Jeremy Hewitt, and P.J. Tanner\n(the \u201cBeaufort County Defendants\u201d) (D.I. 21); a motion to dismiss for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction filed by Walter J. Galdenzi, 9 Marina, LLC, Southern Cross\nInvestments, Inc. and Suzanne Mark (the \u201cGaldenzi Defendants\u201d) (D.I. 46); a\nmotion for removal of attorneys of record for fraud on the Court, filed by Plaintiff\n(D.I. 51); and a motion to compel an investigation for fraud on the Court, filed by\nPlaintiff (D.I. 53). The matters are fully briefed.\nIl. BACKGROUND\n\nThe Complaint is over 600 pages long, contains over 1,600 numbered\nparagraphs, and includes 67 pages of exhibits. He alleges that in April 2020 during\nthe start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he was 88 years old and living in a Days Inn\n\nhotel located in Hilton Head, South Carolina. The hotel shut down in response the\n\n{\npandemic, and Plaintiff was forcefully evicted, despite having nowhere to go and,\nas a result of his age, being at high risk serious for serious complications or death\nfrom COVID-19. (DL. 1). Notably, he asserts that \u201c[t]his Court has personal\njurisdiction because the events giving rise to the matter in controversy occurred\nwithin the State of South Carolina and they occurred in Beaufort County South\nCarolina.\u201d (Jd. at { 194). He also expounds upon the connections of the Galdenzi\nDefendants and Beuafort County Defendants to the state of South Carolina for\npersonal jurisdiction purposes. (/d. at JJ 195, 197-99, 201-09).\n\nIn their motion to strike and dismiss, the Hotel Defendants argue the\nexpansive complaint fails to comply with Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, which requires \u201ca short plain statement of the claim showing that the\npleaders is entitled to relief.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 5-7). The motions to dismiss filed by the\nBeaufort County Defendants and Galdenzi Defendants argue both that this Court\nlacks personal jurisdiction over them, and that venue is improper in the District of\nDelaware. (D.I. 22 at 2-6; D.I. 47 at 5-10).\n\nIn February 2022, a month before filing this action, Plaintiff filed an\nessentially identical complaint in the District of South Carolina. See Wolffe v.\nGaldenzi, et al., No. 9:22-cv-00548 (D.S.C.). In March 2022, days before\ninitiating this action, he also filed an essentially identical complaint in the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, et al., No. 2:22-cv-994 (E.D.\n2\nPa.).! In September 2022, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the South Carolina\naction, with prejudice, indicating that he would instead proceed with his cases in\nPennsylvania and Delaware. See Wolffe, No. 9:22-cv-00548, D.I. 75.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania case, the Hotel Defendants filed a motion to strike and\ndismiss that was essentially identical to the motion they filed in this proceeding.\nAlso in the Pennsylvania case, the Beaufort County Defendants and Galdenzi\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction that were\nessentially identical to the motions they filed in this proceeding, except they of\ncourse argued that Pennsylvania, rather than Delaware, did not have personal\njurisdiction over them, and that the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was not the\nproper venue.\n\nIn October 2021, in the Pennsylvania case, the court granted the Beaufort\nCounty Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, noting that all of his arguments for\npersonal jurisdiction appeared to be repeated from his complaint in the South\nCarolina case and accordingly directed at South Carolina, and that \u201c[a]bsent from\nMr. Wolffe\u2019s complaint are allegations that the Beaufort County defendants have\nany contacts with Pennsylvania, or that any of the acts or omissions giving rise to\nthis action occurred in Pennsylvania. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, 2022 WL 14813700,\n| Plaintiff additionally filed an essentially identical complaint in Pennsylvania state\n\ncourt, which was removed to federal court and then consolidated with his federal\ncase. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, et al., No. 2:22-cv-2882 (E.D. Pa.).\n3\nat *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 2022) (emphasis original). The Court also concluded that\nvenue was not proper as to the Beaufort County Defendants. Jd. at *3-4. In\nNovember 2022, also in the Pennsylvania case, the court granted the Hotel\nDefendants motion to strike and dismiss, holding that \u201cMr. Wolffe\u2019s complaint is\nrife with redundant and verbose recitations of facts and rambling and unclear\nallegations, making it difficult to parse out which claims he is asserting against\nwhich defendants,\u201d and that \u201cWolffe\u2019s complaint fails to meet the Rule 8(a)(2)\nstandard requiring a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claims.\u201d Wolffe v. Galdenzi,\n2022 WL 16722318, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 4, 2022). The Galdenzi filed their\nmotion to dismiss in the Pennsylvania case in January 2023, but three days later,\nbefore the court ruled on the motion, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case,\nindicating that he would proceed with his claims in this Court. Wolffe v. Galdenzi,\net al., No. 2:22-cv-994, D.I. 61.\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA. Rule 8(a)\n\nThe Court has the power to dismiss a complaint that fails to comply with\nRule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Ala\u2019 Ad-Din Bey v. United\nStates DOJ, 457 F. App\u2019x 90, 91 (3d Cir. Jan. 11, 2012) (per curiam) (affirming\ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal). Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nrequires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\n4\nentitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Each averment must be \"simple,\nconcise, and direct.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). \u201cTaken together,\u201d Rules 8(a) and\n8(d)(1) \u201cunderscore the emphasis placed on clarity and brevity by the federal\npleading rules.\u201d In re: Westinghouse Sec. Litig., 90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(citation omitted). Dismissal pursuant to Rule 8 has been found warranted where a\ncomplaint is rambling, unclear, and/or unwieldy. See Trillo v. Kent, 477 F. App\u2019x\n881, 882 (3d Cir. Sept. 6, 2012) (per curiam). Dismissal under Rule 8 has also\nbeen held proper when a complaint \u201cleft the defendants having to guess what of the\nmany things discussed constituted [a cause of action].\u201d Binsack v. Lackawanna\nCnty. Prison, 438 F. App\u2019x 158, 160 (3d Cir. July 21, 2011) (per curiam).\n\nB. Rule 12(b)(2)\n\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court\nmay dismiss a suit for lack of jurisdiction over the person. Although Rule 8 does\nnot require a plaintiff to set forth in the complaint \u201cthe grounds upon which the\ncourt has personal jurisdiction over the defendant,\u201d Hansen v. Neumueller GmbH,\n163 F.R.D. 471, 474 (D. Del. 1995), \u201conce a defendant has raised a jurisdictional\ndefense, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving by affidavits or other competent\nevidence that jurisdiction is proper.\u201d Dayhoff Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co., 86 F.3d 1287,\n1302 (3d Cir. 1996). If the district court does not hold an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ncourt should resolve any factual disputes in the plaintiffs favor and should deny\n\n5\nthe motion if the plaintiff's evidence establishes \u201ca prima facie case of personal\njurisdiction.\u201d Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAlliance Pharma SA, 623 F.3d\n147, 155 (3d Cir. 2010).\n\nTwo requirements, one statutory and one constitutional, must be satisfied for\npersonal jurisdiction to exist over a defendant. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. C\n& C Helicopter Sales, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 400, 403 (D. Del. 2002). \u201cFirst, a\nfederal district court may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state\nin which the court sits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.\u201d Jd. (citing\nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)). The Court must, therefore, determine whether there is a\nstatutory basis for jurisdiction under the Delaware long-arm statute. Jd. (citing 10\nDel. C. \u00a7 3104(c)). \u201cSecond, because the exercise of jurisdiction must also\ncomport with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the Court\nmust determine if an exercise of jurisdiction violates [Defendant\u2019s] constitutional\nright to due process.\u201d Jd. (citing International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S.\n310 (1945)).\n\n\u201cOnce a jurisdictional defense has been raised, the plaintiff bears the burden\nof establishing with reasonable particularity that sufficient minimum contacts have\noccurred between the defendant and the forum state to support jurisdiction.\u201d Jd.\n(citing Provident Nat\u2019! Bank v. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 819 F.2d 434,\n\n437 (3d Cir. 1987). Plaintiff may establish jurisdictional facts through sworn\n6\naffidavits or other competent evidence. See Time Share Vacation Club v. Atlantic\nResorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d 61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\nPlaintiff must demonstrate either specific or general jurisdiction. Specific\njurisdiction arises when the particular cause of action arose from Defendant\u2019s\nactivities within the forum state. In contrast, general jurisdiction does not require\nDefendant\u2019s connections be related to the particular cause of action, but that\nDefendants have continuous or systematic contacts with the forum state. American\nBio Medica Corp. v. Peninsula Drug Analysis Co, Inc., 1999 WL 615175 (D. Del.\n1999). \u201c[A]t no point may a plaintiff rely on the bare pleadings alone in order to\nwithstand a defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of in personam\njurisdiction.\u201d Jd. Plaintiff is required to respond to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction with actual proof, not mere allegations. Id.\nSee also Hurley v. Cancun Playa Oasis In\u2019tl Hotels, 1999 WL 718556, at *1 (E.D.\nPa. Aug. 31, 1999) (stating that \u201c[g]eneral averments in an unverified complaint or\nresponse without the support of sworn affidavits or other competent evidence are\ninsufficient to establish jurisdictional facts\u201d).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Court will adopt the reasoning of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nand grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The Court agrees that the Hotel\n\nDefendants and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that dismissal without\n\n7\nprejudice of the approximately 600-page complaint under Rule 8(a) is appropriate.\nSee Trillo, 477 F. App\u2019x at 882 (affirming dismissal under Rule 8(a) of \u201crambling\nand unclear\u201d complaint); Wolffe, 2022 WL 16722318, at *2 (holding that \u201cMr.\nWolffe\u2019s complaint is rife with redundant and verbose recitations of facts and\nrambling and unclear allegations, making it difficult to parse out which claims he\nis asserting against which defendants\u201d).\n\nThe Court also adopts the reasoning of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nand the Beaufort County Defendants and holds both that personal jurisdiction is\nlacking over these Defendants and that venue is not proper in this Court. See\nWolffe, 2022 WL 14813700, at *3 (\u201cAbsent from Mr. Wolffe\u2019s complaint are\nallegations that the Beaufort County defendants have any contacts with\n[Delaware], or that any of the acts or omissions giving rise to this action occurred\nin [Delaware].\u201d). Finally, the Court will adopt the same reasoning with regard to\nthe Galdenzi Defendants. See Id.\n\nPlaintiffs pending motions for removal of attorneys of record for fraud on\nthe Court, and to compel an investigation for fraud on the Court, will denied as\nfrivolous. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, 2022 WL 14813702 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 2022)\n\n(denying essentially identically motions as frivolous).\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant the Hotel Defendants\u2019\nmotion to strike and dismiss (D.I. 17); (2) grant the Beaufort County Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss (D.I. 21); (3) grant the Galdenzi Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\n(D.I. 46); and (4) deny Plaintiff's pending motions (D.I. 51, 53). Plaintiff will be\ngiven leave to file an amended complaint against the Hotel Defendants.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}
