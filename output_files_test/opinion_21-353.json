{"case_name": "Corso v. Concordia Healthcare USA, Inc.", "case_number": "21-353", "judge": "Judge Stephanos Bibas", "date": "04-13-2023", "ocr_text": " \n  \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \n \nJOSEPH CORSO , \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nCONCORDIA HEALTHCARE USA, \nINC. , \n \nDefendant . \n No. 21-cv-353-SB \nKevin Scott Mann, CROSS & SIMON , LLC, Wilmington, Delaware ; David B. Gordon, \nTiana A. Bey, MITCHELL SILBERBERG & KNUPP LLP, New York, New York  \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff  \n \nAlessandra Glorioso , Angela E. Dralle, William J. Miller,  DORSEY & WHITNEY LLP, \nWilmington, Delaware  \n \nCounsel for Defendant  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nApril 13 , 202 3 \nBIBAS, Circuit Judg e, sitting by designation . \nIn my last opinion, I granted partial summary judgment for each party , letting  \nCorso recover $669, 600 in interest payments.  D.I. 66. I then gave the parties two \nweeks to brief the issue of prejudgment interest. Id. I now calculate pre - and post -\njudgment interest  and enter final judgment in the amount of $831,916.85 .  \n2 1. Corso is entitled to prejudgment interest . In general, \u201cDelaware law awards pre -\njudgment interest as a matter of right.\u201d Balooshi v. GVP Glob. Corp. , 2022 WL \n576819, at *14 (Del. Super. Ct. Feb. 25, 2022). But Concordia says Corso has no right \nto it or that it should begin accruing later than the d ate of the breach . Concordia  is \nmistaken.  \nFirst, Concordia says the total -breach rule should apply  not just to the contract\u2019s \nprincipal payments, but also its interest payments. D.I.  67, at 1. But this argument \nis not about prejudgment  interest; it relitig ates the substance of the case. So I reiter-\nate part of the summary -judgment  opinion : True, the interest payments were \u201calso \ntied to the outstanding principal.\u201d D.I. 65, at 12.  But the exception to the total -breach \nrule requires that the payments be \u201c not re lated to one another .\u201d Id. at 15 ( emphasis \nadded, internal quotation marks omitted). Though the interest payments had some  \nrelationship through the principal payments , that relationship was  a layer removed. \nSo they were independent enough that \u201cthe failure  to make one interest payment did \nnot substantially affect [Corso\u2019s] expectation in future ones. \u201d Id. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted, alteration in original).  \nSecond , Concordia argues that \u201cCorso \u2018essentially forgave the Company\u2019s \nbreaches\u2019 until the date he filed suit and thereby made an unconditional and \u2018unre-\nquited demand,\u2019 so pre -judgment interest should not begin to accrue until March 9, \n2021.\u201d D.I.  67, at 2 (quo ting Balooshi , 2022 WL 576819, at *14).  Not so. \u201cIn contract \nactions, pre -judgment interest is computed from the date of the breach.\u201d Balooshi , \n2022 WL 576819, at *1. And I already decided that each breach  occurred when each  \n3 payment came due . See D.I. 65, at 14 , 17\u201318. Plus, even according to the case  that \nConcordia cites, Corso  did not  forgive Concordia, because  he made \u201cdemands for as-\nsurances\u201d  on several occasions.  Balooshi , 2022 WL 576819, at *14 ; see D.I. 65 at 20 \u2013\n21. So Corso is entitled to prejudgment  interest  accruing from the dates of breach . \n3. Calculating prejudgment interest . Next, the parties dispute the prejudgment \ninterest rate. Concordia says I should use the 6% rate for interest payments from the \ncontract; Corso says I should use the Delaware  statutory rate. Corso is right.  \nAlthough the Delaware prejudgment -interest statute can be displaced by a \u201ccon-\ntract rate,\u201d there is no such rate here. 6 Del. C. \u00a7  2301(a). The contract does not set \nan all -purpose rate. Instead, the only time it mentions th e 6% rate is when referring \nto the \u201cinterest in arrears on the unpaid principal balance.\u201d D.I.  1-1, at 2. Because \nthe contract \u201cfixes the rate of interest to be paid before maturity but is silent as to \nthe interest to be paid thereafter in case of default, \u201d I apply the \u201cstatutory rate of \ninterest, rather than the contract rate.\u201d Martin v. Star Pub. Co. , 107 A.2d 795, 796 \n(Del. Super. Ct. 1954).  \nThe statutory rate is \u201c5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\u201d as of the date of \nthe breach. 6 Del. C. \u00a7  2301(a ); Balooshi , 2022 WL 576819, at *14. The breaches here \noccurred on October 25, 2018, 2019, and 2020. And I am entering final judgment on \nApril 13, 2023. So interest has accrued for 1,631, 1,266, and 900 days, respectively.  \nOn the breach  dates, the Federal  Reserve discount rate was 2.75%, 2.25%, and \n0.25%. Fed. Rsrv. Bank, Interest Rates, Discount Rate for United States,  \n4 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=jafQ#0. So the prejudgment interest rates are \n7.75%, 7.25%, and 5.25%. Corso asks for simple interest . D.I.  68, at *3.  \nThus, the prejudgment  interest amounts are $77,295.99, $56,127.16, and \n$28,893.70, totaling $162,316.85.  Combined with the $669,600, the total amount \nowed to Corso is $831,916.85.  \n4. Calculating post -judgment interest.  As for post -judgmen t interest, it compounds \nannually at the federal statutory rate: \u201c [T]he weekly average 1 -year constant ma-\nturity Treasury yield \u2026 for the calendar week preceding the date of the judgment.\u201d \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1961(a). Last week, that was 4. 53%. Fed. Rsrv. Bank, Mar ket Yield on \nU.S. Treasury Securities at 1 -year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Ba-\nsis, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS1. And post -judgment interest runs from the \n\u201cdate of the entry of the judgment\u201d to the date of payment. \u00a7  1961(a), (b). So post -\njudgment interest will accrue on the $ 831,916.85 from April 13 , 2022,  at an annual ly \ncompounding rate of  4.53%. "}
