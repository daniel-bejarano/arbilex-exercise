Fallon", "date": "04-13-2023", "ocr_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE\n\nGORDIAN MEDICAL, INC. d/b/a\nAMERICAN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES and\nAMT ULTIMATE HOLDINGS, L.P.,\n\nPlaintiffs,\nCivil Action No. 22-319-MN-SRF\n\nVv.\n\nMISTY VAUGHN,\n\neNO a SS SS eS\n\nDefendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\nAt Wilmington this 13th day of April, 2023, the court having considered non-party\nCuritec, LLC\u2019s (\u201cCuritec\u201d) motion to quash the subpoena served on non-party Justworks\nEmployment Group, LLC (\u201cJustworks\u201d) (D.I. 59), and the associated briefing and filings (D.I.\n60; D.I. 61; D.I. 63; D.I. 68), IT IS ORDERED that Curitec\u2019s motion is DENIED for the reasons\nset forth below:\n\n1. Background. The court incorporates by reference the detailed factual background\nin its prior decisions, (D.I. 22; D.I. 45), and provides below only those facts most relevant to the\npending motion to quash the subpoena.\n\n2. This is a diversity action for breach of contract brought by Gordian Medical, Inc.,\nAmerican Medical Technologies, and AMT Ultimate Holdings, L.P. (collectively, \u201cAMT\u201d)\nagainst Misty Vaughn (\u201cVaughn\u201d). The complaint alleges that Vaughn breached her\nemployment agreements by terminating her employment with AMT and joining AMT\u2019s\n\ncompetitor, Curitec. (D.I. 1-1 at ff 1, 32, 37, 38; Ex. A at \u00a7 9(b)-(c))\n3.  Curitec has a contract with Justworks, a cloud-based human resources contractor,\nfor benefits, payroll, human resources, and compliance support. (D.L. 63, Ex. 1 at ] 2; Ex. A)\nOn January 26, 2022, Vaughn executed a Worksite Employee Acknowledgment agreement with\nJustworks confirming her understanding that Curitec had a contractual relationship with\nJustworks to assist Curitec \u201cwith human resources related matters, such as payroll, workers\u2019\ncompensation insurance, and employee benefits, as agreed upon between Justworks and\n[Curitec].\u201d (Ud., Ex. 1 at Ex. A at J 1)\n\n4. On November 22, 2022, AMT served a subpoena on Justworks seeking the\nproduction of \u201c[a]ny and all documents in your possession, custody or control regarding: (1)\nCuritec, LLC\u2019s employment of Misty Vaughn; and (2) Any and all of the \u2018human resource\nrelated matters, such as payroll, workers\u2019 compensation insurance and employee benefits\u2019\nreferenced in paragraph 1 of the attached Worksite Employee Acknowledgement agreement\nsigned by Misty Vaughn.\u201d (D.I. 48-1 at 5)\n\n5.  Curitec filed the pending motion to quash on December 6, 2022, the day before the\ndeadline to respond to the subpoena expired. (D.I. 59; D.I. 48-1 at 2) Fact discovery closes on\nMay 16, 2023. (D.I. 72 at 2)\n\n6. Legal Standard. A non-party seeking protection from a subpoena may do so\nthrough \u201cthe overlapping and interrelated provisions of both Rules 26 and 45.\u201d Mannington\nMills, Inc. v. Armstrong World Indus., 206 F.R.D. 525, 529 (D. Del. 2002). Rule 45(d)(3)(B) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the court \u201cmay, on motion, quash or modify\nthe subpoena if it requires . . . disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research,\ndevelopment, or commercial information[.]\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(B)(i). However, trade\n\nsecrets are not \u201cabsolutely privileged from discovery in litigation.\u201d Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of\nShreveport, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 107 F.R.D. 288, 292 (D. Del. 1985). Under Rule 45(d)(3),\nthe district court has discretion over whether to quash or modify a subpoena. See In re Bestwall\nLLC, 47 F.4th 233, 242 (3d Cir. 2022).\n\n7. Analysis. Curitec moves to quash the subpoena issued by AMT to non-party\nJustworks on two grounds: (1) the subpoena improperly seeks to obtain Curitec\u2019s trade secret\ninformation; and (2) the subpoena exceeds the scope of permissible discovery under the\nrelevance and proportionality standard of Rule 26(b). (D.I. 60 at 5-8) In the alternative, Curitec\nmoves for a protective order under Rule 26(c) and seeks a corresponding award of attorneys\u2019\nfees. (/d. at 8-9) For the following reasons, Curitec\u2019s motion is DENIED.\n\n8. Motion to Quash. Curitec objects to AMT\u2019s subpoena of Justworks because it\nwould require the disclosure of Curitec\u2019s trade secret and confidential information. (D.I. 60 at 7-\n8) To prevail on the motion to quash, Curitec bears the burden to show that: (1) the information\nsought is a trade secret, and (2) disclosure of the information might be harmful. See Taro\nPharms. U.S.A., Inc. v. Perrigo Israel Pharms. Ltd., C.A. No. 14-989-RGA, 2015 WL 7737310,\nat *1 (D. Del. Dec. 1, 2015).\n\n9. In support of its position that the subpoenaed documents are trade secrets, Curitec\ndefines \u201ctrade secret\u201d in accordance with a federal criminal statute, without explaining how that\ndefinition applies to a civil breach of contract action being litigated in federal court pursuant to\ndiversity jurisdiction. (D.I. 60 at 7-8) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839).' Curitec\u2019s argument is\notherwise limited to the conclusory assertion that \u201cCuritec\u2019s employee compensation packages\nare part of what makes it competitive and an industry leader in its field,\u201d and \u201cCuritec derives\n\nsignificant economic value from such business and financial information, and it takes extensive\n\n' Curitec repeats this error in the reply brief. (D.I. 68 at 7)\n3\nmeasures to ensure that such information remains secret.\u201d (D.I. 60 at 8) These conclusory\nallegations, which are not supported by a declaration or any supporting documents, do not satisfy\nCuritec\u2019s burden to show that the information sought is a trade secret or that disclosure of the\nsecret might be harmful. Cash Today of Texas, Inc. v. Greenberg, C.A. No. 02-mc-77-GMS,\n2002 WL 31414138, at *3 (D. Del. Oct. 23, 2002) (\u201cIt is not the court\u2019s role to fathom arguments\non [the movant\u2019s] behalf, however, and \u2018blanket and generalized\u2019 assertions of confidentiality,\nabsent allegations regarding specific harm, are not sufficient to sustain a motion to quash.\u201d).\n\n10.\u2018 The authority cited by Curitec does not support a different outcome. In Peters v.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, the Western District of Pennsylvania observed that \u201c[e]mployee\ncompensation may constitute confidential business information\u201d in analyzing pending motions to\nseal or unseal documents. 2019 WL 109402, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 4, 2019) (emphasis added).\nThe decision does not support a conclusion that employee compensation information amounts to\na trade secret in all instances. The court granted a motion to unseal documents containing\nallegedly confidential compensation information because the defendant \u201csupplie[d] no sworn\nstatement or other evidence\u201d to support allegations of serious injury or harm if the information\nwere disclosed. Id. at *4. Here, Curitec has similarly failed to provide any evidence supporting\na conclusion that Curitec would be harmed by the disclosure of the subpoenaed information.\n\n11. _ In the reply brief, Curitec argues that a presumption of harm applies to the\ndisclosure of the subpoenaed information due to the competitive relationship between AMT and\n\nCuritec.? (D.I. 68 at 3) In support of this \u201cpresumption,\u201d Curitec relies exclusively on the\n\n2 Curitec cites D.I. 59 at page 6 to suggest that AMT has ignored \u201cCuritec\u2019s host of citations to\n\nfederal statute and Third Circuit authority on point.\u201d (D.I. 68 at 5) Docket entry 59 is Curitec\u2019s\n2-page motion. (D.I. 59) Even assuming Curitec intended to refer to its opening brief, a review\nof D.I. 60 at page 6 contains no citations to case authorities or statutes. (D.I. 60 at 6) The table\nof contents in Curitec\u2019s opening brief reveals that Curitec cited a total of five cases, only one of\n\n4\nWestern District of Pennsylvania\u2019s unpublished decision in Nova Chemical Inc. v. Steiner, 2007\nWL 9813317 (W.D. Pa. June 11, 2007), and accuses AMT of \u201cpresent[ing] a misleading and\nwoefully incomplete legal standard by choosing to omit this presumption from its representation\nof Curitec\u2019s burden as briefed in its Opposition.\u201d (/d.) AMT\u2019s failure to address a portion of an\nunpublished, non-binding decision from outside this district is not cause to suggest AMT seeks\nto mislead the court, and Curitec\u2019s \u201caspersions seem to exceed the bounds of legitimate\nadvocacy\u201d in this regard. See Acceleration Bay LLC v. Activision Blizzard, Inc., C.A. No. 16-\n453-RGA, 2017 WL 9833512, at *1 n.2 (D. Del. June 23, 2017).\n\n12. Moreover, the court\u2019s discussion of the applicable standard for disclosure of trade\nsecrets in Nova Chemical is consistent with the legal standard applied herein. The Nova\nChemical court affirmed that, \u201cto resist discovery of a trade secret, a party must first demonstrate\nby competent evidence that the information sought through discovery is a trade secret and that\ndisclosure of the secret might be harmful.\u201d 2007 WL 9813317, at *2 (emphasis added).\nAlthough the Nova Chemical court indicated that \u201cdisclosure to a competitor is presumed more\nharmful than disclosure to a non-competitor,\u201d nothing in the decision suggests that this negates\nthe movant\u2019s burden to establish confidentiality and harm by competent evidence. Id. (citing\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co., 107 F.R.D. at 293). Here, Curitec has offered no evidence to establish\n\nthat the subpoenaed information is trade secret information.\n\nwhich was a decision from the Third Circuit. (/d. at ii) The citation to the Third Circuit case is\nfound in the section of the brief addressing Curitec\u2019s standing to bring the motion to quash under\nRule 45, which is undisputed. (D.I. 60 at 5; see D.I. 63 at 7) On this record, the court is unable\nto ascertain the \u201chost of citations\u201d to which Curitec refers in arguing that it would be harmed by\nthe disclosure of the subpoenaed information. Putting aside the lack of legal authority\nsupporting Curitec\u2019s position, Curitec\u2019s reply brief fails to remedy the dearth of evidence\nshowing that Curitec would experience harm from the disclosure under the facts of this specific\ncase. See Cash Today, 2002 WL 31414138, at *3.\n\n5\n13. The burden does not shift to AMT to show that the subpoenaed information is\nrelevant and necessary because Curitec has not satisfied its burden to show the trade secret\nnature of the subpoenaed information and the harm caused by disclosure. See Taro Pharms.,\n2015 WL 7737310, at *1 (\u201cIf such a showing is made, the burden shifts to the party seeking\ndiscovery to show that the disclosure of the trade secret is both relevant and necessary.\u201d).\n\n14. Even if the court were to find Curitec had satisfied its burden, AMT has\nestablished that the disclosure of the subpoenaed information is relevant and necessary to the\ncase under Rule 45(c)(3). See Taro Pharms., 2015 WL 7737310, at *2 (\u201cThe relevance\nrequirement is drawn broadly.\u201d). The prayer for relief in AMT\u2019s complaint confirms that AMT\nseeks injunctive relief against Vaughn. (D.I. 1-1 at 21-22) To obtain injunctive relief, AMT\nmust establish it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted. See Rigby v.\nJennings, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, C.A. No. 21-1523-MN, 2022 WL 4448220, at *4 (D. Del. Sept. 23,\n2022) (explaining that the standard for both preliminary and permanent injunctions requires a\nshowing of irreparable harm).\n\n15. The complaint alleges that Vaughn agreed to the non-competition, non-\nsolicitation, and confidentiality clauses in her Employment Agreement in recognition of the\nirreparable harm AMT could suffer if Vaughn provided similar services for a competitor after\nseparating from AMT. (DI. 1-1 at 10-12) According to the pleaded allegations, Vaughn\u2019s\nactions \u201cthreaten to cause Plaintiffs imminent, irreparable harm and injury, including without\nlimitation, the loss of clients, profits, business reputation, market share, the disclosure and\nmisuse of trade secret, confidential and/or proprietary business information, and loss of\ngoodwill.\u201d (Id. at 19) Discovery on the nature of Vaughn\u2019s role at Curitec and its comparability\n\nto the role she held at AMT is relevant to these allegations because it is likely to show whether\nVaughn was in a position to use proprietary information learned at AMT for the benefit of\nCuritec.\n\n16. Curitec also argues that the subpoena should be quashed because the requests are\noverbroad. (D.I. 60 at 6-7) In support of this argument, Curitec repeatedly refers to a discovery\ndispute between AMT and Vaughn regarding the scope of certain requests for production of\ndocuments. (/d.; D.I. 57) There, the court found that the requests for production were not\nlimited in time or scope, or to the employees, customers, and/or business partners who are\nrelevant to the claims in the case. (D.I. 57) Here, in contrast, the subpoena requests employment\nand compensation information specific to Vaughn during her employment by Curitec, which\nbegan on February 7, 2022\u2014a little more than one year ago. (D.I. 1-1 at ]61) The subpoena\nrequests are therefore sufficiently limited in time and scope.?\n\n17. Protective order. In the event the court denies the motion to quash the subpoena,\nCuritec alternatively requests the entry of a protective order under Rule 26(c). (D.I. 60 at 8-9)\nAMT objects to Curitec\u2019s alternative request for relief on the grounds that Curitec lacks standing\nto seek a protective order for a subpoena issued to Justworks. (D.I. 63 at 6)\n\n18. Rule 26(c) applies to \u201c[a] party or any person from whom discovery is sought\nmay move for a protective order[.]\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1). Because Curitec is not a party to\nthe action and is not the subject of the subpoena at issue, AMT argues that Curitec lacks standing\nto seek a protective order. (D.I. 63 at 6) Here, however, there is significant overlap between the\ninformation sought in AMT\u2019s subpoena to Justworks and its subpoena to Curitec. (Compare D.I.\n\n61, Ex. 2 with D.I. 48-1 at 5) Moreover, there is no dispute that the information in Justworks\u2019\n\n3 The document requests in the subpoena are limited on their face to information about Vaughn.\n(D.I. 48-1 at 5) AMT confirms it is seeking a narrow set of employment information related to\nVaughn\u2019s brief employment by Curitec. (D.I. 63 at 9)\n\n7\npossession is maintained by Justworks on behalf of Curitec pursuant to the contractual agreement\nbetween Justworks and Curitec. (D.I. 63, Ex. 1 at Ex. A) AMT cites no authority holding that a\nnon-party lacks standing to seek a protective order under comparable circumstances.\n\n19. Nonetheless, Curitec\u2019s alternative request for a protective order is denied-in-part\nbecause Curitec does not provide a form of order or otherwise describe the scope of protection\nsought. Instead, Curitec simply recites the text of Rule 26(c). (D.I. 60 at 8-9) Curitec fails to\nacknowledge the Protective Order which includes third-party discovery that has already been\nentered in this case. The Protective Order to which the parties stipulated provides:\n\nThis Protective Order (hereinafter \u201cProtective Order\u201d or \u201cOrder\u201d) shall apply to all\n\ndocuments or other information produced in the course of discovery in this Action\n\nthat the producing person or entity (the \u201cProducing Entity\u201d) has designated as\n\n\u201cCONFIDENTIAL \u2014 SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER\u201d or \u201cATTORNEYS\u201d\n\nEYES ONLY \u2014 SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER\u201d (either a \u201cConfidentiality\n\nDesignation\u201d or collectively the \u201cConfidentiality Designations\u201d) pursuant to this\n\nOrder, including but not limited to, all initial disclosures, all responses to discovery\n\nrequests, all deposition testimony and exhibits, and all materials (including\n\ndocuments or testimony) produced by non-parties in response to subpoenas issued\n\nin connection with this matter, including all copies, excerpts, and summaries\nthereof (collectively the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\n\n(D.I. 42 at \u00a7 1) The protective order expressly permits \u201cany third party subpoenaed by one of the\nparties\u201d to designate as Confidential or Attorneys\u2019 Eyes Only \u201cany documents, testimony,\nwritten responses, or other materials produced in this case\u201d if they contain personnel records,\nconfidential personal information, or other forms of competitively sensitive commercial\ninformation. (/d. at \u00a7 4) In the absence of any showing that these provisions are insufficient to\nprotect Curitec\u2019s sensitive information, Curitec\u2019s alternative request for an undefined protective\norder is denied, but the court orders the production of the subpoenaed documents in issue subject\n\nto the existing Protective Order.\n20. Having denied Curitec\u2019s motion to quash, the court also denies Curitec\u2019s request\nfor attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Rule 37(a)(5).4 (D.I. 60 at 9)\n\n21. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Curitec\u2019s motion to\nquash (D.I. 59) is DENIED.\n\n22. This Memorandum Order is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written\nobjections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Order.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to four (4) pages\neach.\n\n23. The parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nwww.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nerry R. Fallo\nUnited.States Magistrate Judge\nee\n\n4 For the first time in the reply brief, Curitec also suggests it is entitled to fees under Rule\n45(d)(1).
