Civil Action No. 15-108-RGA \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nDefendant Caterpillar has moved for certification of interlocutory appeal of my denial of \nits summary judgment motion. (D.I. 463). The motion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 465,468, \n471). \nThe parties agree upon the standard for such a certification. I would need to certify that \nthe appeal involves a controlling question of law upon which there is substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion, the resolution of which would materially advance the ultimate termination \nof the litigation. (D.I. 465 at 8; D.I. 468 at 3). Caterpillar says that there are \"at least\" five such \ncontrolling questions of law. (D.I. 465 at 10). \nI think Caterpillar is wrong. It does not cite any cases that are contrary to any of the \ncases I cited in my summary judgment opinion. Indeed, for most of the issues it raises, it is clear \nthat it does not disagree on the law. It merely disagrees with my application of that law to the \nPage 1 of 3 facts of record in this case. It essentially wants a do over with the Court of Appeals on the \napplication of established law to an extensive factual record. \nCaterpillar's first argument is that I impermissibly allowed late amendment of the \npleadings . That is not a \"controlling question of law.\" Amendment of pleadings is a \ndiscretionary decision. \nCaterpillar 's second argument, which is not addressed in the summary judgment opinion, \nis that Caterpillar is too remote to be a defendant when ICP is the plaintiff. ICP is an \"indirect \npurchaser,\" not a \"direct purchaser.\" The argument relates to \"the risk of duplicative recovery \nand the potential for overly-complex damages and apportionment calculations .\" McCarthy v. \nRecordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 851 n.14 (3d Cir. 1996). Caterpillar did not address either the \nrisk of duplicative recoveries1 or the potential for problems related to damages in its summary \njudgment briefing. (D.I. 391 at 34-35; D.I. 433 at 6-7). It does not hint at any such argument in \nthe instant briefing either. \nCaterpillar's third argument is that I ruled incorrectly on its collateral estoppel argument. \nI put it like this because Caterpillar and I agree that the same Third Circuit case states the law. \n(D.I. 456 at 23; D.I. 465 at 13). There is no dispute about a controlling question of law.2 \nCaterpillar's fourth argument is, essentially, that the great weight of the evidence is on its \nside. That could be true, but that is not the standard that applies when considering summary \njudgment. Caterpillar characterizes Plaintiffs evidence as \"speculation.\" (D.I. 465 at 15). \nCaterpillar simply disagrees with my analysis of the record. \n1 I cannot see how there would be any risk at all. \n2 Although not germane to this Memorandum Order, I note that the related case in Florida was \nargued to the Eleventh Circuit on December 13, 2022. \nPage 2 of 3 Caterpillar's fifth argument is that the evidence for the tortious interference claim is \ninsufficient. I do not think there is any disagreement on the applicable law. Rather, the \ndisagreement is on whether the record provides a basis for Plaintiff to move forward on this \nclaim. That is not a controlling question of law. \nCaterpillar's motion (D.I. 463) is DENIED. \n{L~ \nIT IS SO ORDERED this I day of April 2023. \nPage 3 of 3 "}, {"case_name": "Simmons v.

No. 23-115-GBW\nSCOTT CERESINI, Warden, and :\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nPetitioner is an inmate at the Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown,\nDelaware. He has filed a form application for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2241 (D.I. 1 at 1-8), a typed document titled \u201cPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d\n(\u201cPetition\u201d) (D.I. 1 at 9-17), and a document titled \u201cPoints and Authorities in\nSupport of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\u201d (\u201cPetition\u201d). (D.I. 1-1) In the\nform application, Petitioner explains that he\n\nwas arrested on April 20, 2015 on assorted charges which\n\nincluded guns and drugs to which he had in his private\nvehicle while traveling on Interstate 95 through\nWilmington, Delaware. On 6-22-15, a True Bill of\nIndictment was handed down for Eric. B. Simmons with\nfirearms, drug, and traffic charges pursuant to Delaware\nUniform Controlled Substances Act under Title 16 of the\nDelaware Code; the National Firearms Act under\nDelaware Code Title 11; and Traffic charges on Delaware\nUniform Traffic Complaint and Summons under Delaware\nTitle 21.\n(DI. 1 at 9-10) Petitioner explains that, following a Superior Court jury trial on\nMay 10, 2017, the Superior Court sentenced him to ten years at Level V\nincarceration. (D.I. 1 at 10) It appears that Petitioner will be transferred to Iowa at\nthe completion of his Delaware sentence. See Simmons v. Akinbayo, 2018 WL\n3827149 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 6, 2018).\n\nPetitioner asserts that he \u201cis a private sentient man, a living being with a\nsoul, flesh, and blood, and not a \u2018subject\u2019 or \u2018citizen\u2019 of the U.S. government or\nDelaware state government.\u201d (D.I. 1 at 9) He contends that he is in custody in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the State of Delaware lacked\njurisdiction over his person. (See id.) Petitioner seeks immediate release from\ncustody, and explains that he has filed the instant habeas request under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2241 rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because\n\n\u00a7 2254 requires a state habeas petitioner to be in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a state court[. This]\ndescription [...] does not fit Petitioner\u2019s circumstances\nbecause the judgment is a nullity, a void judgment.\u201d!\n\n(DI. 1-1 at 1-2)\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\nof someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground\nthat his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Notably,\na district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition \u201cif it plainly appears from\nthe face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not\nentitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\nI. DISCUSSION\nPetitioner invokes the so-called \u201cflesh and blood\u201d movement to avoid the\nconsequences of his state criminal convictions. As explained in a recent decision\nby the Western District of Pennsylvania,\n[a]dherents to the \u201cflesh and blood\u201d movement believe\nthat a person has two distinct versions of himself, a \u201cflesh-\n\nand-blood\u201d natural man and a legal person\u2014the vessel\n[also called a \u201cstrawman\u201d]. They theorize that the\n\n'Petitioner\u2019s justification for filing his petition under \u00a7 2241 lacks merit, because \u00a7\n2254 is the exclusive federal remedy when a petitioner challenges the validity of a\nstate criminal conviction and sentence. Nevertheless, since Petitioner\u2019s instant\nhabeas request is summarily dismissible regardless of the authority relied upon, the\nCourt will not address this error in more depth.\n\n3\ngovernment has power only over the strawman and not\n\nover the live person, who remains free. Therefore, the real\n\nperson can demand that government officials pay\n\nenormous sums of money to use the strawman's name or,\n\nin the case of prisoners, to keep him in custody. Courts\n\nhave routinely dismissed nonsensical claims of this nature\n\nas patently frivolous.\nEllis v. Philadelphia Cnty., 2022 WL 1491411, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 28, 2022)\n(collecting cases) (cleaned up).\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Petitioner\u2019s instant \u201cflesh and\nblood\u201d argument is frivolous and fails to provide a basis for habeas relief.\nTherefore, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition for failing to assert\nan issue cognizable on federal habeas review.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant\nPetition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because\nPetitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a\n\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir.

Huntley\u2019s (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) unopposed motion for leave to\namend the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). (D.I. 40) For the\nfollowing reasons, Plaintiffs motion to amend is GRANTED.!\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff filed this action against defendants VBit Technologies Corp., VBit Mining LLC,\nAdvanced Mining Group, Danh Cong Vo a/k/a Don Vo, Katie Vo, Sean Tu, Jin Gao, Lillian\nZhao, and various John Doe individual defendants and ABC companies (\u201cDefendants\u201d) on\nSeptember 2, 2022, alleging violations of various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and asserting causes of action for common law fraud, breach of\n\ncontract, and unjust enrichment under Delaware law. (D.I. 1) Five named Defendants answered\n\n| Filings associated with the pending motion are found at D.I. 42, D.I. 44, DI. 45, D.L. 46, and\nDI. 47.\nthe complaint. (D.I. 9; D.I. 11; D.I. 18) Defendants Lillian Zhao and Advanced Mining Group\ndid not respond to the complaint.? Defendant Jin Gao filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for\nimproper venue pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), and Plaintiff subsequently\nfiled a notice of voluntary dismissal of Jin Gao, resulting in termination of the motion to dismiss.\nMI. 22; D.I. 31)\n\nPlaintiff filed the pending motion for leave to amend on March 6, 2023, seeking to add\nthirty-five plaintiffs, remove existing defendant Katie Vo from the lawsuit, and add corporate\naffiliate VBit DC Corp. as a defendant. (D.I. 40, Ex. B) The proposed amended complaint also\nraises additional factual allegations and includes six additional causes of action against\nDefendants. (/d.) The additional counts include causes of action for negligent\nmisrepresentation, civil conspiracy, violations of the Delaware Uniform Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act and Consumer Fraud Act, violations of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices\nand Consumer Protection Law, appointment of a receiver, and successor liability / de facto\nmerger or consolidation. (/d., Ex. B at {J 170-78, 191-219) Plaintiff alleges that these factual\nallegations were recently discovered as a result of further engagement by Plaintiff's counsel with\nvictims of Defendants\u2019 conduct and additional due diligence and factual research performed by\nPlaintiff's counsel. (D.I. 40 at 3)\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that after a responsive\n\npleading has been filed, a party may amend its pleading \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written\n\nconsent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d and \u201c[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d\n\n2 In the pending motion, Plaintiff indicates he \u201chas not yet determined whether Defendants\nLillian Zhou and Advanced Mining Group exist[.]\u201d (D.L 40 at 2)\n\n2\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies within the discretion\nof the court. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs.\nLitig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to\nthe amendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Arco, 921 F.2d 484, 487 (3d Cir. 1990). In the absence\nof undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the amendment\nshould be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non-moving party. See\nFoman, 371 U.S. at 182; In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1434.\n\nI. DISCUSSION\n\nPlaintiff's motion to amend is granted. There is no undue delay because Plaintiff sought\nleave to amend only six months after the original complaint was filed, before a scheduling order\nwas entered. (D.I. 1; D.I. 40) Plaintiff explains that the proposed amendment could not be made\nsooner because the additional factual allegations and causes of action are based on information\nobtained from the proposed additional plaintiffs. (D.I. 40 at 3)\n\nMoreover, no Defendant has indicated that Plaintiffs proposed amended pleading would\nbe futile or would result in undue prejudice. (D.I. 42; D.I. 45; D.I. 46; D.I. 47) Defendants\nanswered the original complaint in lieu of moving to dismiss, and they raise no opposition to the\nnewly added counts in the proposed amended complaint. (D.I. 9; D.I. 11; D.I. 18)\n\nConsequently, there is no basis on the present record to deny Plaintiff's motion to amend under\nRule 15(a). See Tri-State Energy Sols., LLP v. KVAR Energy Savings, Inc., C.A. No. 08-209-SD,\n2010 WL 11707411, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2010) (granting unopposed motion to join additional\nparties and add certain counts to the complaint).\n\nThe proposed amended complaint removes Katie Vo as a defendant. (D.I. 40, Ex. B) In\n\nhis reply letter, Plaintiff confirms that the omission of Katie Vo from the proposed amended\npleading was intentional. (D.I. 44 at \u00a7 6) Having granted Plaintiff's motion to amend the\ncomplaint, I recommend that the court dismiss defendant Katie Vo from the action without\nprejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is GRANTED in the\nform attached as Exhibit A to the pending motion.? (D.I. 40) The proposed amended complaint\nattached to the motion to amend shall be docketed by the clerk as the amended pleading. In\naccordance with the amended complaint and the parties\u2019 agreement, I recommend that the court\ndismiss defendant Katie Vo from the action without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 41(a)(2).

A) The remaining Defendants who have entered an\nappearance in this action shall have thirty (30) days to file a response to the amended complaint.\nAn Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.\nThis Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), Fed.

(D.I. 1) Pending before the court are two motions: (1)\nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s final\ndecision denying Plaintiff's claim for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the\nSocial Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433, (D.I. 11); and (2) the Commissioner\u2019s\nmotion for remand to the Social Security Administration for further proceedings pursuant to the\nfourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), (D.I. 13).? Plaintiff opposes the Commissioner\u2019s motion\nfor remand for further proceedings and argues that the court should instead remand the case for a\nfinding of disability and an award of benefits. (D.I. 15) For the reasons set forth below, the\n\nCommissioner\u2019s motion for remand is DENIED, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is\n\n' On August 2, 2022, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned judicial officer\nto conduct all proceedings in this matter through final judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).\n\n(DI. 10)\n2 The briefing on the pending motion for remand is found at D.I. 14 and D.I. 15.\nGRANTED insofar as Plaintiff seeks the entry of judgment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) reversing\nthe Commissioner\u2019s final decision and ordering the payment of benefits.\nL BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff filed an application for DIB on April 30, 2014, alleging disability as of February\n4, 2010. (D.I. 8 at21) An ALJ held a hearing on April 25, 2017, and subsequently issued an\nunfavorable decision on June 22, 2017, finding that Plaintiff could perform a reduced range of\nlight work even though she had severe impairments which included degenerative disc disease of\nthe lumbar spine, degenerative joint disease, obesity, and thoracic outlet syndrome. (Jd. at 21-\n27) After the Appeals Council denied her request for review, Plaintiff appealed the decision to\nthis court. (Jd. at 10-14)\n\nOn August 8, 2019, the court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanded the case for\nfurther administrative proceedings. (D.I. 8-1 at 590-627) In reaching this conclusion, the court\nfound that the ALJ erred in his assessment of the medical opinion evidence by assigning little\nweight to the opinions of three treating physicians: Dr. Tuerff, Dr. Devotta, and Dr. Bose. (/d. at\n620-25) The court determined that the treatment records the ALJ relied on to discount those\nopinions were not inconsistent with the medical opinions. (/d.) Because the treating physician\nopinions established greater limitations than those set forth in the ALJ\u2019s residual functional\ncapacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) determination, the court rejected that determination. (Jd. at 626) The court\nfurther found that the ALJ erred in his finding that Plaintiff could perform light work based on\nthe opinions of the state agency consultants because those consultants opined that Plaintiff could\nperform sedentary work. (Jd. at 625)\n\nOn remand, another hearing was held and the ALJ again issued an unfavorable decision\n\nin April of 2020 based on a finding that Plaintiff could perform a reduced range of sedentary\nwork. (D.I. 8-1 at 457-71) After the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review,\nPlaintiff again appealed the decision to this court. The Commissioner filed an uncontested\nmotion to remand the case for further consideration of the medical opinion evidence and\nPlaintiff's RFC, and to obtain supplemental testimony from a vocational expert. (D.L. 8-2 at 32-\n33) The court granted the uncontested motion to remand on March 18, 2021. (Jd. at 28)\n\nOn August 15, 2021, the Appeals Council entered an order effectuating the remand,\nconcluding that the ALJ had not complied with the court\u2019s 2019 order and setting forth specific\ninstructions requiring the ALJ to further consider the medical opinion evidence, Plaintiff's RFC,\nand supplemental vocational evidence. (D.I. 8-2 at 40-42) The ALJ held a hearing in January of\n2022 and denied Plaintiff's claim yet again in March of 2022, finding that Plaintiff could\nperform a reduced range of sedentary work at step 5 of the sequential analysis. (D.I. 8-1 at 1002-\n13)\n\nFor the third time, Plaintiff has appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision. (D.I. 1) For the second\ntime, the Commissioner has responded to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with a\nmotion for remand, conceding that the ALJ erred in considering Plaintiff's claim. (D.I. 14) The\ncourt must now decide whether to remand for further administrative proceedings pursuant to the\nfourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), or whether a finding of disability and an order for\npayment of benefits is appropriate at this juncture.\n\nIl. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nSection 405(g) defines the role of the court in reviewing Social Security disability\ndeterminations, providing that \u201c[t]he court shall have the power to enter, upon the pleadings and\ntranscript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the\n\nCommissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). \u201cOftentimes the remedy prescribed by the court is the relief sought . . . by the\nCommissioner: a remand for further proceedings. Such relief is specifically authorized by\nstatute, and given the deference owed to administrative agency decisions, is often appropriate.\u201d\nDiaz v. Berryhill, 388 F. Supp. 3d 382, 390 (M.D. Pa. 2019). But the statute also provides that\nthe court may direct the Commissioner to award benefits instead of remanding for further\nproceedings. See Brownawell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. , 554 F.3d 352, 357-58 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\nA decision regarding the proper form of relief under \u00a7 405(g) is within the discretion of\nthe court. See Podedworny v. Harris, 745 F.2d 210, 221 (3d Cir. 1984). An order directing the\nagency to award benefits is appropriate only if two conditions are met: (1) \u201cthere has been an\nexcessive delay in the litigation of the claim which is not attributable to the claimant;\u201d and (2)\n\u201cthe administrative record of the case has been fully developed and substantial evidence on the\nrecord as a whole indicates that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits.\u201d Diaz, 388 F.\nSupp. 3d at 391. If both conditions are met, \u201cit is unreasonable for a court to give the ALJ\nanother opportunity to consider new evidence concerning the disability because the\nadministrative proceeding would result only in further delay in the receipt of benefits.\u201d\nPodedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22.\n\nUnder the first prong of the analysis, \u201ccourts measure th[e] delay both in terms of the\npassage of years and by reference to whether there have been prior appeals and remands.\u201d Diaz,\n388 F. Supp. 3d at 391. Generally, courts have found that administrative delays of five years or\nmore in cases involving one or two prior remands constitute excessive delays warranting an\naward of benefits. See id. (citing Brownawell, 554 F.3d at 358 (awarding benefits in case\n\ninvolving eight-year delay and two prior remands); Morales v. Apfel, 225 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir.\n2000) (awarding benefits in case involving ten-year delay and two appeals); Podedworny, 745\nF.2d at 223 (awarding benefits after more than five years of proceedings and two appeals)).\n\nThe second prong is satisfied when the record is fully developed and substantial evidence\non the record supports a conclusion that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits. Diaz,\n388 F. Supp. 3d at 391-92 (citing Gilliland v. Heckler, 786 F.2d 178, 184 (3d Cir. 1986)). In\ncircumstances where \u201cthe record before the agency does not support the agency action, [ ] the\nagency has not considered all relevant factors, or [ ] the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate\nthe challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare\ncircumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d Fla.\nPower & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). However, an award of benefits is\nproper when an \u201cextensive medical record, wrongly rejected by the ALJ, is substantial evidence\u201d\nthat a claimant is disabled, Morales, 225 F.3d at 320, or when treatment records and medical\nopinions over an extended period support a conclusion that the claimant cannot maintain a\nnormal, regular work schedule, Nance v. Barnhart, 194 F. Supp. 2d 302, 322 (D. Del. 2002).\n\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Delay\n\nThe parties do not meaningfully dispute Plaintiff's satisfaction of the first condition\nregarding excessive delay which is not attributable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff's disability application\nwas filed more than eight years ago and was subject to three hearings before an ALJ and three\nappeals to the district court. (D.I. 8 at 21-27; D.I. 8-1 at 457-71, 590-627, 1002-13; D.L. 8-2 at\n40-42; D.I. 14) The delays are therefore excessive both in terms of the overall duration and the\nnumber of instances in which the court has been charged with remanding flawed ALJ decisions.\n\nSee Diaz, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 393 (\u201c[I]f we acceded to the Commissioner\u2019s suggestion and\nremanded this case we would be setting the stage for an extraordinary, fourth administrative\ndecision in this case.\u201d). The delays in this case are more pronounced than those deemed\nexcessive by the Third Circuit in Brownawell and Podedworny. See Brownawell, 554 F.3d at\n358 (awarding benefits in case involving eight-year delay and two prior remands); Podedworny,\n745 F.2d at 223 (awarding benefits after more than five years of proceedings and two appeals).\nTherefore, the first condition supports a finding of disability and an award of benefits.\n\nB. Development of the Administrative Record\n\nThe court must next determine whether substantial evidence dictates a finding that the\nclaimant is disabled.? See Podedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22. In performing this analysis, the\ncourt is mindful of the Commissioner\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe district courts have no fact-finding\nrole in Social Security cases.\u201d Grant v. Shalala, 989 F.2d 1332, 1338 (3d Cir. 1993).\nNonetheless, the Supreme Court has affirmed the court\u2019s \u201cbroad grant of authority\u201d under \u00a7\n405(g) to enter a judgment reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision without remanding the case\nfor arehearing. Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1765, 1779 (2019).\n\nThe Commissioner contends that remand for further proceedings is appropriate because\nthe ALJ\u2019s articulation of the medical opinion evidence is unclear and does not permit meaningful\njudicial review, and the record contains competing medical opinion evidence. (D.I. 14 at 2-3)\nBut, as in Podedworny, correction of certain defects in the ALJ\u2019s assessment of the medical\nopinion evidence is not enough in this case. 745 F.2d at 222. Instead, the record before the court\nestablishes that the Commissioner\u2019s presentation of medical and vocational evidence is not\n\nsufficient to support a finding that Plaintiff is not disabled. Id.\n\n3 The parties do not appear to dispute the completeness of the administrative record. See\nPodedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22.\nSubstantial evidence in the record before the court supports a conclusion that Plaintiff\ncannot perform sedentary work. Plaintiff seeks benefits for the time between her alleged\ndisability onset date on February 4, 2010, and her date last insured, which was December 31,\n2014. (D.L. 8 at 21) The evidence of record, including most of the opinions by Plaintiff's\ntreating specialists which have been the focal point of multiple remands, falls within this time\nperiod. Because this evidence has been fully developed and will not change, the court concludes\nthat a fourth attempt by the ALJ to assess the evidence is not a worthwhile use of resources. See\nPodedworny, 745 F.2d at 222.\n\nPlaintiff's medical treatment notes from February 4, 2010 through December 31, 2014\nsupport a conclusion that Plaintiff is disabled and entitled to benefits. Plaintiff underwent a first\nrib resection, scalenectomy, and neurolysis to treat her thoracic outlet syndrome in February of\n2010. (D.L. 8-1 at 256-58) Although the surgery eliminated her back and upper chest pain, she\nexperienced pain, tingling, and numbness from her shoulder to her hand. (Jd.) Her surgeon\nconfirmed in follow up treatment notes that Plaintiff would be unable to return to work due to\nher continuing post-operative neurologic symptoms in her left arm, as well as her inability to use\nher right arm. (Jd. at 260-62) On physical examination for her neck and shoulder pain in July of\n2010, Plaintiff showed significant weakness in her rhomboid strength of the left shoulder, and\nthe range of motion in her neck was impaired to about 60%. (Jd. at 863-65) Trigger point\ninjections were not successful in reducing her pain. (/d. at 866)\n\nPlaintiff also received a series of lumbar epidural injections in 2012 to treat back pain\nwhich radiated down her right leg, but she continued to experience low back and mid thoracic\npain. (/d. at 119-20) She underwent a provocative lumbar discography on December 10, 2012,\n\nwhich revealed a grade IV tear at the L3 and L4 spinal segments, followed by a lumbar fusion\nprocedure on April 23, 2013. (/d. at 121-25) Her pain levels in the months following surgery\nwere between six and eight on a scale of ten, and she continued to experience lower back pain\nradiating across her lower limbs. (Jd. at 125-27) Physical therapy notes after her lumbar surgery\nindicate that she could walk for an hour and sit for thirty minutes at a time. (D.I. 8 at 589)\nPlaintiff also received injections in her sacroiliac joint in November of 2013, but the injections\nprovided no relief. (D.I. 8-1 at 130-31) An MRI in April of 2014 revealed postoperative fibrosis\nand narrowing at the L3 and L4 discs. (D.I. 8 at 797)\n\nPlaintiff also sought treatment for knee and hip pain beginning in 2010. Treatment notes\nfrom orthopedist Bruce Katz, M.D., confirm that Plaintiff received injections in both knees in\nNovember of 2010 and discussed distal realignment surgery. (D.I. 8 at 356) Plaintiff also saw\northopedist Alex Bodenstab, M.D. for treatment of her right hip and groin pain. (/d. at 360) Dr.\nBodenstab described her symptoms as \u201cfairly dramatic\u201d and recommended a hip arthroscopy.\n(Id.) On May 31, 2011, Dr. Bodenstab performed a right hip arthroscopic resection of a torn\nlabrum. (Jd. at 364-65) Following the surgery, Plaintiff continued to report pain and groin\ncramping, although she demonstrated increased tolerance for walking. (Jd. at 366-67) In July of\n2011, Dr. Bodenstab described Plaintiffs hip issues as \u201cthe least of her issues right now\u201d and\nnoted that she was under consideration for a patellar realignment to treat damage to the cartilage\nin her knee. (/d. at 369) Physical therapy notes from 2014 confirm that Plaintiff continued to\nexperience groin pain at a level that prevented her physical therapist from initiating strength\ntraining. (D.I. 8-1 at 20) Her pain was exacerbated by lifting, pushing, and pulling. (/d.)\n\nOn October 27, 2011, Plaintiff underwent surgery to treat her moderate to severe plantar\n\nfasciitis and a moderate heel spur which demonstrated bone marrow edema. (D.I. 8-1 at 375,\n387-88) Despite initial improvement post-surgery, Plaintiff's pain returned throughout her entire\nfoot, limiting her to walking no more than one hour per day with pain. (/d. at 398, 416-17)\n\nThe treating specialists who performed Plaintiff's surgeries and treated her pain provided\nmedical opinions that uniformly described severe, work-preclusive limitations. See SSR 96-8p,\n1996 WL 374184, at *1 (July 2, 1996) (explaining that an individual\u2019s ability to do sustained\nwork-related activities on a \u201cregular and continuing basis\u201d means 8 hours a day, for 5 days a\nweek). Dr. Devotta, a pain management specialist, opined in May of 2014 that Plaintiff could\nstand or walk no more than two hours and sit no more than four hours in an eight-hour workday,\nwith one or two unscheduled breaks lasting fifteen to twenty minutes and two or three absences\nper month. (D.I. 8 at 823) Dr. Devotta issued another opinion on June 10, 2015, a few months\nafter Plaintiff's date last insured. (D.I. 8-1 at 845-48) In this assessment, Dr. Devotta reiterated\nthat Plaintiff could stand or walk less than two hours less than two hours in an eight-hour\nworkday and could remain at a workstation for two to three hours total in a standard workday,\nwith one or two unscheduled breaks per day and three absences per month due to her pain and\nother symptoms. (Jd.)\n\nDr. Bose, Plaintiff's orthopedic surgeon, similarly opined in March of 2014 that Plaintiff\ncould sit for two hours in an eight-hour workday and stand, walk, and drive for one hour each in\nan eight-hour workday. (D.L. 8 at 818) In a 2017 opinion, Dr. Bose maintained his opinion that\nPlaintiff had a maximum tolerance of sitting for two hours and standing, walking, or driving for\none hour in an eight-hour workday. (D.I. 8-1 at 448) And Dr. Tuerff, a vascular surgeon, opined\nin October of 2010 that Plaintiff would need to lie down for about two hours per workday and\ntake four to five unscheduled breaks. (Id. at 312-14) These limitations are work preclusive\n\naccording to the vocational expert, who testified that frequent unscheduled breaks and more than\none absence a month would not be tolerated in an employment setting. (D.I. 8-1 at 523, 1065)\nTaking into consideration the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, as well as Plaintiff's medical\nopinions and treatment records, there is substantial evidence to support Plaintiff's inability to\nwork full-time.\n\nThe ALJ\u2019s failure to articulate a sufficient basis for rejecting the medical opinions of\nPlaintiffs treating physicians, despite multiple remands with explicit instructions on how to\nremedy the deficiencies, further supports an award of benefits at this stage. See Pearson v. Saul,\n2020 WL 1865715, at *13 (MLD. Pa. Apr. 14, 2020). The court\u2019s prior remands in this case have\nlargely been based on errors in the ALJ\u2019s assessment of opinions from Plaintiff's treating\nphysicians, Drs. Tuerff, Devotta, and Bose, which in turn impact the adequacy of the RFC\nassessment. (D.I. 8-1 at 620-25); see Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 614 (3d Cir. 2014)\n(explaining that hypothetical posed to vocational expert must accurately portray credibly\nestablished limitations). In 2019, the court determined that the medical opinions of Drs. Devotta\nand Bose describing Plaintiff's significant functional limitations were supported by objective\nmedical evidence, and the ALJ had not adequately discussed the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\n404.1527(c) in connection with the medical opinions of Drs. Tuerff, Devotta, and Bose. (D.I. 8-\n1 at 620-25)\n\nThe ALJ has admittedly not been able to remedy these deficiencies in the 2020 and 2022\nopinions. (D.I. 8-1 at 468-69, 1010-11; D.I. 8-2 at 32-33; D.I. 14) In 2021, the Commissioner\nconceded that another remand for further consideration of the opinion evidence and Plaintiff's\nRFC was appropriate, and the Appeals Council set forth specific instructions requiring the ALJ\nto further consider the medical opinion evidence, Plaintiff's RFC, and supplemental vocational\n\nevidence. (D.I. 8-2 at 32-33, 40-42) Nonetheless, the Commissioner now admits that the ALJ\u2019s\n\n10\nMarch 2022 decision was again deficient in the assessment of the treating physician opinions.\n(D.I. 14) In that decision, the ALJ afforded no weight to the opinions of Dr. Bose, Dr. Tuerff, or\nDr. Devotta because the restrictive postural limitations set forth in those opinions were\ninconsistent with the overall record\u2014essentially the same conclusion that was rejected by the\ncourt in the first appeal back in 2019. (D.I. 8-1 at 1010-1 1)\n\nThe Commissioner argues that remand for further proceedings is appropriate because the\nrecord contains competing opinion evidence from a state agency medical expert who challenged\nthe extent of the limitations imposed by Plaintiff's treating physicians and opined Plaintiff could\nstand or walk for four hours and sit for six hours in a normal workday. (D.I. 14 at 3; D.I. 8 at 91)\nBut the court\u2019s 2019 decision explained that the opinions of Drs. Bose and Devotta were\nconsistent with objective medical evidence in the record and noted that the opinions of state\nagency consultants contradicting the treating physicians\u2019 opinions could not properly be credited\nin the absence of an adequate explanation of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for doing so. (D.I. 8-1 at 622-\n25); See Fargnoli v. Massanari, 247 F.3d 34, 43 (3d Cir. 2001). The ALJ was given two more\nopportunities to provide such an explanation, and it is undisputed that the ALJ failed to do so on\nboth occasions. (D.I. 8-1 at 468-69, 1010-11; D.I. 8-2 at 32-33; D.I. 14) This supports a\nconclusion that there is no sufficient basis in the overall record to reject the limitations\nconsistently articulated in the treating physicians\u2019 opinions. After three decisions by the ALJ\nand two failed attempts to repair the record, \u201cit is unreasonable . . . to give the ALJ another\nopportunity to consider new evidence concerning the disability because the administrative\nproceeding would result only in further delay to the receipt of benefits.\u201d Podedworny, 745 F.2d\n\nat 222; see also Smith, 139 S. Ct. at 1779.\n\n11\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner\u2019s motion for remand is DENIED (D.I. 13),\nand Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED insofar as it seeks judgment under\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) reversing the Commissioner\u2019s final decision and ordering the payment of\n\nbenefits.

WASHINGTON,\nPetitioner,\nv. : Civil Action No. 22-1299-GBW\n\nROBERT MAY, Warden, and\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE\n\nSTATE OF DELAWARE,\n\nRespondents.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nIn February 2001, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner\nCorey D. Washington (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) of one count of possession of cocaine with\nintent to deliver, one count of maintaining a vehicle, two counts of possession of\ncocaine within 1000 feet of a school, one court of resisting arrest, one count of\ndriving with a suspended or revoked license, and one count of possession of drug\nparaphernalia. See Washington v. State, 284 A.3d 725 (Table), 2022 WL 4242151,\nat *1 (Del. Sept. 14, 2022). The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as a habitual\n\noffender to life imprisonment plus nine years. See Washington, 2022 WL\n4242151, at *1. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions\nand sentence on March 18, 2002. See Washington v. State, 793 A.2d 311 (Table),\n2002 WL 440253, at *1 (Del. Mar. 18, 2002).\n\nThereafter, Petitioner filed two motions for postconviction relief pursuant to\nDelaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (\u201cRule 61 motions\u201d) \u2014 one in 2003 and\none in 2005 \u2014 which were denied. See Washington v. State, 940 A.2d 946 (Table),\n2007 WL 4110636, at *1 (Del. Nov. 20, 2007). Petitioner only appealed the denial\nof his second Rule 61 motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that\ndenial on November 20, 2007. See id. at *2.\n\nIn October 2017, the Superior Court granted Petitioner\u2019s request for a\ncertificate of eligibility to file a petition to modify Petitioner\u2019s habitual offender\nsentence under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214(f). See Washington, 2022 WL 4242151, at *1.\nThe Superior Court granted the petition on December 11, 2018, and reduced\nPetitioner\u2019s life sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver to thirty-\nfive years of Level V incarceration, suspended after fifteen years for decreasing\nlevels of supervision. See id. The remainder of Petitioner\u2019s sentence was\nunchanged. Jd.\n\nOn May 4, 2022, Petitioner filed a Rule 35 motion for correction of an\n\nillegal sentence. See Washington, 2022 WL 4242151, at *1. The Superior Court\n\n2\ndenied the Rule 35 motion on May 11, 2022 for being repetitive and because the\nsentence was appropriate for the reasons set forth at sentencing. See id. The\nDelaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment on September\n14, 2022. See id. at *2.\n\nIn October 2022, Petitioner filed the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cPetition\u201d) presently pending before the Court.\n(D.I. 1) Petitioner contends that the Delaware state courts violated his Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights by failing to retroactively apply Delaware\u2019s 2011\nNed Carpenter Act! to his case when denying his Rule 35 motion to modify his\nsentence. According to Petitioner, his sentences for possession of cocaine with\nintent to deliver (thirty-five years of Level V incarceration suspended after fifteen\nyears) and two counts of possession within 1000 feet of a school (two years of\nLevel V incarceration for each count) are illegal because the Ned Carpenter Act\n\neliminated or modified those offenses in 2011. (D.I. 1 at 9; D.I. 1-1 at 26)\n\n\u2018Delaware enacted the Ned Carpenter Act in 2011. See Ayala v. State, 204 A.3d\n829, 838 (Del. 2019). \u201cThe Act eliminated the offenses of possession near a park\nand maintaining a dwelling but did not apply retroactively to any violation that\noccurred prior to September 1, 2011.\u201d Jd. at 838-39.\n0. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nA district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\nof someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground\nthat his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). It is well-\nsettled that \u201c[s]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law,\u201d? and claims\nbased on errors of state law are not cognizable on habeas review. See Estelle, 502\nUSS. at 67-68. Notably, a district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition\n\u201cif it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it\nthat the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.\nIi. DISCUSSION\n\nAlthough presented in terms of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,\nPetitioner\u2019s challenge to the Delaware state courts\u2019 denial of his Rule 35 motion\nfor correction of sentence alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal\nhabeas relief because Petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware state\ncourts\u2019 analysis and application of a state law in a state collateral proceeding. See\nHassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 1998) (holding that the \u201cfederal\n\nrole in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what\n\n2Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).\n4\noccurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner\u2019s\nconviction; what occurred in the petitioner\u2019s collateral proceeding does not enter\ninto the habeas proceeding.\u201d) (emphasis in original); see also Lambert v.\nBlackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (\u201calleged errors in [state] collateral\nproceedings . . . are not a proper basis for habeas relief\u2019). Accordingly, the Court\nconcludes that summary dismissal of the instant Petition is appropriate.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant\nPetition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because\nPetitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United\n\nStates v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.\n\nTie\n\nGREGORY B.

(D.I. 3-1 at 7); see Clark v. State, 900 A.2d 100 \n(Table), 2006 WL 1186738, at* 1 (Del. 2006). The two victims were the seven and nine year old \nsons of Petitioner 's girlfriend at the time. See Clark, 2006 WL 1186738 at *l. On May 23, \n2005, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to 102 years of incarceration . The Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner's convictions May 2, 2006. See Clark, 2006 WL 1186738, at \n*2. \nIn 2022, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a pro se motion for correction of \nsentence pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 35(a). (D.I. 3 at 4; D.I. 3-1 at 10) \nThe Rule 35(a) motion alleged that the \"Superior Court failed to give all but one charge an effective date as to when [Petitioner's] sentences were to begin.\" (D.I. 3 at 4) The Superior \nCourt denied the Rule 35(a) motion on November 16, 2022, and Petitioner does not indicate ifhe \nappealed that decision. (D.I. 3; D.I. 3-1 at 10) \nOn November 30, 2022, Petitioner filed the instant Petition and a Motion for Leave to \nProceed In Forma Pauperis . (D.I. 1; D.I. 3) The Petition asserts four grounds for relief: (1) trial \ncounsel provided ineffective assistance during Petitioner 's 2005 criminal proceeding ; (2) the \nSuperior Court did not provide effective dates for the sentences imposed for eleven of his twelve \n2005 convictions; (3) in 2022, the Superior Court violated Delaware state law by denying \nPetitioner's Rule 35(a) motion; and (4) the Superior Court judge who denied Petitioner's rule \n35(a) motion in 2022 acted with a closed mind. (D.I. 3) \nI. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES \nThe instant Petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. A district court may entertain a petition for a writ of \nhabeas corpus on behalf of someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on \nthe ground that his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States, 1 and \nmay summarily dismiss a habeas petition \"if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and \nany exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 \n2254. Notably, claims based on errors of state law are not cognizab le on habeas review. See \nEstelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684,691 (1975) (noting that \"[s]tate \ncourts are the ultimate expositors of state law.\"). \n1See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). \nj \n2 II. DISCUSSION \nA. Claims Three and Four: State Law Issues \nClaims Three and Four challenge the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner's Rule 35 \nmotion for modification of sentence and, therefore, involve matters of state law. See Lambert v. \nBlackwell, 387 F.3d 210,247 (3d Cir. 2004) (\"alleged errors in [state] collateral proceedings ... \nare not a proper basis for habeas relief'); Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. \n1998) (holding that the \"federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to \nevaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner's \nconviction; what occurred in the petitioner's collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas \nproceeding.\") (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss Claims \nThree and Four for failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. \nB. Claims One and Two: Time-Barred \nIn contrast, Claims One and Two assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. \nNevertheless, as explained below, the Court's preliminary review indicates that Claims One and \nTwo are time-barred under AEDPA's one-year statute oflimitations . See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b); \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l) ; United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir. 1999); Mason v. Meyers, \n208 F.3d 414 (3d Cir. 2000). \nAEDP A imposes a one-year filing deadline that runs from the latest of: \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion \nof direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such \nreview; \n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application \ncreated by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of \nthe United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from \nfiling by such state action; \n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially \n3 recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly \nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively \napplicable to cases on collateral review; or \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims \npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due \ndiligence. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l). The Court does not discern any facts triggering the application of\u00a7 \n2244(d)(l)(B),(C), or (D). Consequently, the one-year period oflimitations for Claims One and \nTwo began to run when Petitioner's convictions became final under\u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A) . \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244( d)(l )(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment but does \nnot seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the statute of \nlimitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed for seeking \ncertiorari review. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012). In this case, the Delaware \nSupreme Court affirmed Petitioner 's convictions on May 2, 2006, and it appears that he did not \nseek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his judgment of conviction became \nfinal on August 1, 2006. Applying the one-year limitations period to that date, Petitioner had \nuntil August 1, 2007 to timely file a habeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 \n(3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA's limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, \n2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA's one-year limitations period is \ncalculated according to the anniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on the \nanniversary of the date it began to run). Petitioner filed the instant Petition on November 30, \n2022, approximately fifteen years after that deadline. Thus, the Court's preliminary screening of \nthe Petition indicates that the remaining cognizable habeas claims -Claims One and Two -are \nuntimely. \n4 AEDPA's limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling. See Holland, \n560 U.S. at 645 (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may \nalso be excused from failing to comply with the limitations period by making a gateway showing \nof actual innocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021). Nevertheless, for \nthe reasons set forth below, none of these doctrines appear to render Claims One and Two timely \nfiled. \n1. Statutory tolling \nPursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA's \nlimitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post\u00ad\nconviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of \nAEDPA's limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A \npost-conviction motion is '\"properly filed' for statutory tolling purposes when its delivery and \nacceptance is in compliance with the state's applicable laws and rules governing filings, such as \nthe form of the document , any time limits upon its delivery, the location of the filing, and the \nrequisite filing fee.\" Crump v. Phelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations \nperiod is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be \nfiled even if the appeal is not eventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. \nPetitioner filed his Rule 35 motion for correction of sentence in 2022, at least sixteen \nyears after the expiration of AEDP A's statute of limitations. Therefore , statutory tolling is \ninapplicable. \n2. Equitable tolling and actual innocence \nEquitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the petitioner \ndemonstrates \"(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary \n5 circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\" Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With \nrespect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to \nthe petitioner 's excusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary circumstance \nrequirement, \"the relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is \nunique to the petitioner , but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA's \none-year deadline.\" Pabon v. Mahanoy , 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary \ncircumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is \"a causal connection, or nexus, \nbetween the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner's failure to file a timely federal \npetition.\" Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). Specifically , \"if the person seeking \nequitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the \nextraordinary circumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary \ncircumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did \nnot prevent timely filing.\" Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768 , 773 (3d Cir.2003). The burden is \non the petitioner to prove that he has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights. See Urcinoli \nv. Cathe!, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir.2008). \nIn addition, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an \"equitable exception \" \nthat can overcome the bar of AEDPA's one-year limitations period. See McQuiggin v. Perkins, \n569 U.S 383,392 (2013); Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 150-51 (3d Cir. 2021). A petitioner \nsatisfies the actual innocence exception by (1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his \ninnocence; and (2) showing \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" that \"a reasonable juror would \nhave reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new evidence. \" Id. at 151. \nPetitioner does not assert his actual innocence , but asks the Court to excuse his late filing \nbecause he is \"doing [his] own legal work prose and learning as [he] go[es].\" (D.I. 3 at 14) A \n6 prisoner's prose status does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance for equitable tolling \npurposes. See Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that a prose \npetitioner's misunderstanding of the law is insufficient to equitably toll habeas limitations \nperiod). Nevertheless, since the Court sua sponte raises the issue of timeliness , Petitioner shall \nhave another opportunity to address the issues of equitable tolling and actual innocence and show \ncause why his Petition should not be dismissed as time-barred. See Day v. McDonough, 547 \nU.S. 198, 209-10 (2006) ( district courts are authorized to consider sua sponte the timeliness of a \nstate prisoner's habeas petition, but must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to \npresent their positions); United States v. Bendolph, 409 F.3d 155, 165 n.15 (3d Cir. 2005). \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss Claims Three and Four \nfor failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. Petitioner, however, shall be \ngiven an opportunity to show cause why Claims One and Two should not dismissed as time\u00ad\nbarred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l) . In his response to this Memorandum and Order, Petitioner \nshall state with specificity any facts establishing a credible claim of actual innocence or facts that \nmay entitle him to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations for Claims One and Two. \nAdditionally, the Court will grant Petitioner 's Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis. The Court \nwill issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum. \nDated: April 14, 2023 \n7 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRJCT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRJCT OF DELAWARE \nJAMES T.

Before the Court is the issue of claim construction of \nmultiple terms in these patents. The Court has considered the parties' joint claim construction brief, \nthe accompanying appendix and declarations , the parties' supplemental submissions as requested \nby the Court, and argument at the claim construction hearing (the \"Hearing\"). See D.I. 120, 133, \n134, 180, 181, 198, 199. \nI. LEGAL ST AND ARDS \nA. Claim Construction \n\"It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to \nwhich the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. \nSumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (\"A claim in a patent provides \nthe metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling the protected invention \"). \"[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for \nconducting claim construction .\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the \nappropriate weight to appropriate sources \"in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent \nlaw.\" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although \nsubsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. \n831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372 (1996)). \n2 \"The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as \nunderstood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and \nprosecution history.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. \n2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art \"is deemed to \nread the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term \nappears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at \nat 1313. \n\"When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic \nevidence, including the claims themselves, the specification , and the prosecution history of the \npatent, which is usually dispositive. \" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d \n1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \"Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted , \ncan ... be valuable\" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because \"claim terms are \nnormally used consistently throughout the patent,\" and so, \"the usage of a term in one claim can \noften illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In \naddition, \"[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]\" Id. For example, \"the \npresence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the \nlimitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\" Id. at 1314-15. \nIn addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which \"is always highly \nrelevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a \ndisputed term.\" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptroni c, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is \nalso possible that \"the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the \npatentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's \nlexicography governs.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. \"Even when the specification describes only \n3 a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the \npatentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of \nmanifest exclusion or restriction. \" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 \n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) ( quoting Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., \n358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification \"is not a substitute for, nor can it be \nused to rewrite, the chosen claim language .\" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d \n870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \nThe Court \"should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence. \" \nMarkman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history \"can often inform the meaning of the claim \nlanguage by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor \nlimited the invention in the course of prosecution[.] \" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. \nIn some cases, the Court \"will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to \nconsult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the \nmeaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period.\" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. \nExtrinsic evidence \"consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, \nincluding expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises.\" Markman, 52 F.3d \nat 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is \"less significant than the intrinsic \nrecord in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nB. Indefinit eness \nSection 112 of Title 35 imposes a definiteness requirement on patent claims. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n112(b) (requiring that the claims \"particularly point[] out and distinctly claim[] the subject matter \nwhich the inventor .. . regards as the invention \"). \"The primary purpose of the definiteness \n4 requirement is to ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public \nof the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, \ne.g., competitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe.\" All Dental \nProdx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 2002). \n\"A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification \ndelineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those \nskilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc., 572 \nU.S. 898,901 (2014). To determine indefiniteness , courts examine \"the patent record-the claims, \nspecification, and prosecution history-to ascertain if they convey to one of skill in the art with \nreasonable certainty the scope of the invention claimed.\" Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., \n789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Like claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, \nbut the Court must sometimes render factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the \nultimate issue of definiteness. See, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int'!, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, \n1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 842-43. \"Any fact critical to a holding on \nindefiniteness ... must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing evidence. \" Intel Corp. \nv. VIA Techs., Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Tech. Licensing Corp. v. \nVideotek, Inc., 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nII. AGREED-UPON TERMS \nThe parties agreed upon the construction of four claim terms as follows: \nClaim Term Agreed-Upon Construction \n\"an effective amount\" \"an amount sufficient to treat the selected \n(' 515 patent, claim 40) CNS disorder\" \n5 Plain and ordinary meaning, \"with an \n\"classified as\" understanding that Defendants may argue that \n(' 515 patent, claim 44) the terms are indefinite in the \nfactual context of an infringement analysis\" \n(D.I. 181) \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"with an \n\"are known to interact with\" understanding that Defendants may argue that \n(' 515 patent, claim 44) the terms are indefinite in the \nfactual context of an infringement analysis\" \n(D.I. 181) \nPlain and ordinary meaning, \"with an \n\"are known to have HERG channel blocking understanding that Defendants may argue that \nproperties \" the terms are indefinite in the \n(' 515 patent, claim 44) factual context of an infringement analysis\" \n(D.I. 181) \nD.I. 180 at 3. The Court will adopt these agreed-upon constructions and will grant Defendants \nleave to renew their indefiniteness argument s. \nIII. DISPUTED TERMS \nA. \"stable dose of levodopa\" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"stable dose of \"a dose of levodopa Not amenable to \"a dose of levodopa \nlevodopa \" that is neither increased construction; that is neither \n('380 patent , claims nor decreased\" indefinite increased nor \n1-2) decreased\" \n' \nWhile Plaintiffs maintain that \"stable dose of levodopa\" can be understood according to its \nplain and ordinary meaning, which according to Plaintiffs is \"a dose of levodopa that is neither \nincreased nor decreased\", Defendants contend that \"stable dose\" is indefinite as it \"provides no \nindication of the length of time and frequency during that time\" so as to inform a skilled artisan \n6 with reasonable certainty what \"unchanging dose oflevodopa should be administered before it can \nbe considered to be 'stable.\"' D.I. 133 at 7-9. \nStarting with the claims, claim 1 of the '380 patent recites: \n1. In a method of treating idiopathic Parkinson's disease in a patient receiving \na stable dose of levodopa, the improvement comprising: \nconcurrently administering safinamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable \nsalt thereof, on an oral dosage schedule of about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about \n5 mg/kg/day, \nwhile maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa. \n'380 patent at cl. 1. Claim 2 of the '380 patent recites: \n2. A method of treating idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease comprising: \nadministering a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa; and \nconcurrently administering safinamide , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt \nthereof, on an oral dosage schedule of about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 5 \nmg/kg/day. \n'380 patent at cl. 2. In claim 1, which the parties agree is written in Jepson1 format (D.I. 133 at 5, \n10), the prior art methods of treating idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (\"PD\") used a \"stable dose of \nlevodopa\". The inventors improved upon the prior art by adding safinamide to the patient's \ntreatment regimen \"while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa.\" That the method \nof treatment involves \"maintaining\" a patient on that \"stable dose\" suggests that the \"stable dose\" \ndoes not increase or decrease. Further, given claim l's Jepson format, explaining that treating a \npatient with a \"stable dose of levodopa\" was accomplished in the prior art, the claim language \nsuggests that a skilled artisan would understand how to treat PD with levodopa, including how to \nrecognize when a patient is receiving a stable levodopa dose. \n1 See Dow Chem. Co. v. Sumitomo Chem. Co., 257 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001) \n( explaining that when a claim \"is written in Jepson format, ... the claim first describes the scope \nof the prior art and then claims an improvement over the prior art.\"). \n7 Claim 2 recites, in non-Jepson format, a method of treatment that involves concurrent \nadministration of safinamide and a \"stable dose of levodopa. \" That the method of treatment \ninvolves \"administering a therapeuticall y effective stable dose\" implies that that once the \"stable \ndose\" is \"therapeuticall y effective,\" that dose stays the same. \nTurning to the specification , while the term \"stable dose of levodopa\" is not used, the \nspecification describes a clinical trial that studied the effect of safinamide on PD symptoms in a \n\"de novo\" group and \"single DA group\", the latter of which \"were treated with one single \ndopamine agonist at stable doses for at least four weeks prior to the screening visit.\" '380 patent \nat 20:25-36; 50-60. The specification describes that the single DA group fared better than the de \nnovo group \"when safinamide was added to a stabilized dose of a variety of dopamine agonists\" \n(as adjunctive therapy) as compared to when safinamide was administered alone (as monotherap y). \nId at 3:5-9; see also id at 23:51-55 (describin g favorable results for \"patients under stable \ndopamine agonist treatment \"). Thus, these descriptions suggest that \"stable doses\" and \"stabilized \ndose[s]\" are unchanged doses. \nThe prosecution history further supports understanding \"stable dose of levodopa \" as a dose \nthat is unchanged. In the Notice of Allowance , the Examiner's explained : \"By 'stable dose,' \nApplicant provides support for this term whereby the dose of L-DOPA is neither increased nor \ndecreased to treat a patient with Parkinson 's Disease ... thereby rendering it distinguishable from \nthe art.\" D.I. 120-24, Ex. Wat JA717. The prosecution history is also consistent with the four\u00ad\nweek time period identified in the specification as the applicant submitted materials describing a \nclinical study in which patients went through a four-week \"levodopa stabilization phase\". See, \ne.g., D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA427; D.I. 134-13, Ex. JJ at JA760; D.I. 120-22, Ex. U at JA507 (\"In \naddition, to guard against changes in drugs confounding the results of the clinical trial, patients \n8 must be on stable doses of these medication s for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the study, and \nthe drug and the dosage must be maintained at a constant level throughout the course of the study, \nif possible.\"). \nAccordingly , in light of the intrinsic record which suggests that a \"stable dose\" is one that \nis unchanged , the Court will construe \"stable dose of levodopa\" to mean \"a dose of levodopa that \nis neither increased nor decreased. \" \nDefendants do not provide an alternate construction. Instead, they contend that the term \n\"stable dose of levodopa\" is indefinite , arguing that \"(t]he intrinsic evidence fails to provide \nreasonable certainty as to the required period of time (i.e., days, weeks, months, etc.) and a \nfrequency of administration during that period of time (q.d., b.i.d., t.i.d., etc.) for a 'dose of \nlevodopa' to become 'stable.\"' D.I. 133 at 10. According to Defendants , without any \nmeasurement scale to determine what constitutes a \"stable dose\", \"stable dose of levodopa\" fails \nto provide objective boundaries to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 38. \nDescriptive words and terms of degree do not render a claim indefinite if there is adequate \nobjective guidance regarding the boundaries of the claim. See Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude \nMed, 30 F.4th 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2022); see also Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech v. ITC, 936 F.3d \n1353, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\"(A] patentee need not define his invention with mathematical \nprecision in order to comply with the definiteness requirement.\") (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In some circumstances , a person of ordinary skill can ascertain an invention 's boundaries \nfrom exemplary designs or specific examples offering an \"objective anchor\" for \ncomparison. Niazi, 30 F.4th at 1348 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, the intrinsic record provides adequate reference points such that the Court cannot \nconclude \"stable dose oflevodopa \" is indefinite . The specification and prosecution history disclose \n9 a data point of four weeks as constituting being on a \"stable dose.\" '380 patent at 20:25-36 ; 20:50-\n60; 23:51-55 ; see also D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA427; D.I. 134-13, Ex. JJ at JA760; D.I. 120-22, Ex. \nU at JA507. While Defendants argue that the specification provides conflicting temporal guidance \nbecause it discloses that in the prior art, patients were administered levodopa for 5-7 years, '380 \npatent at 1 :28-33, the specification does not state that the levodopa dosage remained stable for that \n5-7 year time-period. Rather, the specification explains that patients treated with levodopa began \nto exhibit motor fluctuations after that time period. '380 patent at 1 :28-33. Accordingly, the \nspecification 's four-week period provides an objective anchor from which a skilled artisan can \ndetermine the scope of the claim. \nDefendants further contend that the specification 's disclosures are inapposite because they \nrelate to a stable dose of a dopamine agonist, which \"would be unhelpful to [ a person of ordinary \nskill in the art] deciphering the meaning of a 'stable dose of levodopa.\" ' D.I. 133 at 10-22. But \nDefendants do not support their assertion with any evidence as to what a person of ordinary skill \nin the art would understand about the claims' scope-even after the Court invited Defendants to \ndo so.2 Thus, \"Defendants ' attorney argument falls far short of meeting their burden to prove, by \nclear and convincing evidence ,\" that the '380 patent fails to reasonably inform a person of ordinary \nskill in the art about the scope of the invention. Dasso Int'!, Inc. v. MOSO N Am., Inc., No. 17-\n01574-RGA, 2019 WL 2135855 , at *2 (D. Del. May 16, 2019); see also MiiCs & Partners Am., \nInc. v. Toshiba Corp., No. 14-803-RGA , 2016 WL 4573103 , at *10 & n.23 (D. Del. Aug. 31, \n2016). The Court declines to find \"stable dose of levodopa\" to be indefinite. \n2 See October 7, 2022 Oral Order. B. \"maintaining \" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs ' Defendants ' I\\ The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"maintaining\" Plain and ordinary Not amenable to construction; Plain and ordinary \n(' 3 80 patent, meaning, which is indefinite meaning, which is \nclaim 1) \"keeping\" \"keeping\" \nWhile Plaintiffs argue that \"maintaining \" can be understood according to its plain and \nordinary meaning, which is \"keeping\" , Defendants contend the term is indefinite . D.I. 133 at 23-\n29. \nThe intrinsic record supports construing \"maintaining \" as \"keeping\". Starting with the \nclaims, claim 1 (as discussed supra) describes the prior art method of treating a PD patient who is \n\"receiving a stable dose of levodopa \", the concurrent administration of safinamide to that patient, \nand explains that safinamide should be given \"while maintaining the patient\" on the stable dose of \nlevodopa . '380 patent at cl. 1. \"[M]aintaining \" appears to refer back to the prior art method, \nrequiring the patient to be \"maintained \" or kept on that same stable dose of levodopa . Indeed, \ndependent claim 53 reflects this concept, requiring that the patient receiving a stable dose of \nlevodopa in claim 1 be administered safinamide for at least 12 weeks. '380 patent at cl. 5. A skilled \nartisan would understand that the patient treated according to claim 5' s method was being \n\"maintain[ ed]\" on the stable levodopa dose for those 12 weeks as well. \nTurning to the specification , it uses \"maintaining \" in other contexts to mean \"keeping.\" For \nexample, the specification describes that \"[ o ]ther symptoms of PD include poor balance, due to \n3 Claim 5 recites: \"The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein safinamide , or \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered for at least 12 weeks.\" \n11 the impairment or loss of the reflexes that adjust posture in order to maintain balance.\" '380 patent \nat 10:47-49. It discusses adding buffers to a formulation in \"amounts sufficient to maintain the \npH\" within a specified range, and explains ways a composition's fluidity \"can be maintained. \" Id. \nat 17: 35-40. \nDuring prosecution , the applicant distinguished the prior art by arguing that it did not teach \nthat the levodopa dose given to patients could \"be maintained without reduction when further \nagents are added to the treatment regimen.\" D.I. 120-21, Ex. T at JA482. Additionally, the \napplicant added the clause \"while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa\" to replace \n\"without reducing the patient's dose of concurrently administered levodopa\" in response to an \nexaminer interview so as to \"align more precisely with written description support in the \nspecification.\" D.I. 120-23, Ex.Vat JA710-71 l. \nThus, the intrinsic record suggests that \"maintaining \" can be understood according to its \nplain and ordinary meaning, which is \"keeping\". The Court will adopt that construction. \nDefendants do not contest this construction , 4 but argue that \"maintaining\" suffers not only \nfrom the same indefiniteness as \"stable dose of levodopa\", but it also introduces \"additional \nindefiniteness: for how long after safinamide is added to the patient's treatment regimen must the \n'stable dose' be maintained , and what is the significance of a change in the patient's levodopa dose \nafter that time?\" D.I. 133 at 25. But for the reasons identified above, including that Defendants ' \ndo not support their indefiniteness arguments with any evidence as to what a person of ordinary \nskill in the art would understand about the claims' scope, Defendants have not met their burden \nand the Court does not find \"maintaining \" to be indefinite. \n4D.I.133 at 25. \n12 C. \"a therapeut ically effective stable dose of levodopa\" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants ' F The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"a dose of levodopa \"a dose of levodopa \nsufficient to treat \"a therapeutically sufficient to treat idiopathic effective stable dose idiopathic Parkinson 's Not amenable to Parkinson's disease oflevodopa\" ('380 disease that is neither construction; indefinite that is neither patent, claim 2) increased nor increased nor decreased \" decreased\" \nPlaintiffs propose construing \"a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa\" as \"a \ndose of levodopa sufficient to treat idiopathic Parkinson 's disease that is neither increased nor \ndecreased\", while Defendants contend that this term is indefinite. D.I. 133 at 30-33. \nPlaintiffs' construction is supported by the intrinsic record. Starting with the claims, claim \n2 of the '3 80 patent recites ( as described above) a method of treating idiopathic PD and explains \nthat to accomplish such treatment , a \"therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa\" is \nadministered concurrently with safinamide. '380 patent at cl. 2. The specification describes \ntreatment kits that \"include a therapeutically effective dose of an agent for treating or at least \npartially alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease (e.g., levodopa plus carbidopa \n(SINEMET\u00ae), levodopa plus controlled release carbidopa (SINEMET\u00ae-CR), levodopa plus \nbenserazi de (MADOP AR\u00ae), levodopa plus controlled release benserazide (MADOP AR\u00ae-HBS), \n[and other Parkinson's agents] and safinamide (or a safinamide derivative) .... \" '380 patent at \n5:54-60. And the prosecution history explains that a \"therapeutically effective\" dose refers to a \n\"clinically-relevant\" dose-that is, a dose that is effective to treat PD. D.I. 120-13, Ex.Lat JA357; \nsee also D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA405 (\"safinamide can be added to a stable and therapeutically \neffective L-dopa regimen, providing additional symptomatic benefit\"). \n13 Thus, the claims read in light of the specification and prosecution history suggest that the \nstable levodopa dose be of an unchanging amount sufficient to achieve the desired goal of treating \nPD. Accordingly, the Court will construe \"a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa \" to \nmean \"a dose oflevodopa sufficient to treat idiopathic Parkinson's disease that is neither increased \nnor decreased. \" \nDefendants argue indefiniteness by incorporating their previous arguments as to \"stable \ndose of levodopa \" and \"maintaining.\" D.I. 133 at 32-33. For the reasons identified above, \nincluding that Defendants ' do not support their assertions with any evidence as to what a person \nof ordinary skill in the art would understand about the claims' scope, Defendants have not met \ntheir burden and the Court does not find \"a therapeuticall y effective stable dose of levodopa \" to \nbe indefinite. \nD. \"high purity ... \" \nClaim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants' The Court's \nConstruction Construction Construction \n\"high purity safinamide or \nralfinamide or a \npharmaceutically \nacceptable acid salt \"safinamide or \nthereof'/ \"safinamide or ralfinamide or a \nralfinamide or a pharmaceutically \n\"high purity safinamide or pharmaceuticall y acceptable acid salt \nralfinamide salt with a acceptable acid salt Not amenable thereof that has lower \npharmaceutically thereof that has lower to construction ; than 0.03% (by \nacceptable acid\"/ than 0.03% (by weight) indefinite weight) of impurity \nof impurity Ila7 or Ila7 or impurity Ilb8 \n\"high purity safinamide or impurity Ilb8 or their or their \na pharmaceutically pharmaceutically pharmaceutically \nacceptable acid salt acceptable acid salts\" acceptable acid salts\" \nthereof' and not indefinite \n('515 patent, claims 32-35, \n40-44; '485 patent, claim \n37) \n14 The parties principally dispute the meaning of the phrase \"high purity\" in disputed terms \nof the '515 and '485 patents. While Plaintiffs argue that \"high purity\" refers to safinamide and \nralfinarnide preparations with lower than 0.03% by weight of impurities , D.I. 133 at 34, Defendants \ncontend that \"high purity\" refers to the \"overall chemical purity of a safinarnide preparation ,\" \nresulting in a term that is ambiguous and thus, indefinite . Id. at 42. \nStarting with the claims, claim 32 of the '515 patent recites: \n32. High purity safinamide or ralfinamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid \nsalt thereof with a content of the respective impurity (S)-2-[3-(3-fluorobenzyl)-4-\n(3-fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylarnino]propanarnide (Ila) or (S)-2-[3-(2-fluorobenzyl)-\n4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylarnino]propanarnide (lib) [graphic omitted] or their \npharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, which is lower than 0.03% (by weight). \n'515 patent at cl. 32. Defendants argue that \"Plaintiffs ' construction would render half of the claim \nlanguage that starts with 'with a content' completel y superfluous\" because \"high purity\" modifies \n\"safinarnide \" whereas \"lower than 0.03%\" refers \"to a required level of an impurity, \" meaning that \n\"'[h]igh purity' does not modify \"a content of impurity Ila,\" D.I. 133 at 39. But that claim \nlanguage can be read to reflect the inventors ' discovery disclosing a new process for keeping \nspecific toxic impurities below 0.03% by weight in large scale preparations of safinamide and \nralfinarnide. See, e.g., '515 patent at 1:60-2:27 ; 7:1-3, 7:11-22, 7:57-8:7. \nThe specification supports this reading. It consistently uses the phrases \"high purity\", \n\"highly pure,\" and \"high purity degree\" to specify safinamide or ralfinamide preparations that have \nless than 0.03% by weight of impurities Ila and lib and their salts; not to refer to an overall \nchemical purity level: \nMoreover , another object of this invention is to provide \npharmaceutical formulations comprising safinarnide or ralfinarnide \nor a salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, preferably \nmethanesulfonic acid, as the active agents wherein the content of the \nrespective dibenzyl derivatives (Ila) and (Ilb) or the salt thereof with \n15 a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, e.g. methanesulfonic acid, is \nlower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % (by weight) with \nrespect to the above said active agents. These new pharmaceutical \nformulations were neither suggested nor achievable by applying the \npharmaco-toxicological knowledge regarding safinamide and \nralfinamide nor by using these active agents prepared according to \nthe methods available in the state of the art. \nTherefore, said pharmaceutical formulations comprising safinamide \nor ralfinamide or the salts thereof with a pharmaceutically \nacceptable acid, preferably methanesulfonic acid, having the above \nsaid high purity degree constitute a further object of this invention. \nId. at 7:57-8:8; see also id. at 7:50-56 (\"high purity degree\" safinamide or ralfinamide has a content \nof impurities Ila or Ilb or the salts thereof \"lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % by \nweight\"), id. at 8:50-60 (\"high purity safinamide \" has a content of impurity Ila or a salt thereof \n\"lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01% by weight\"), id. at 9:1-12 (\"high purity \nralfinamide\" has a content impurities Ilb or a salt there of \"lower than 0.03%, preferably lower \nthan 0.01 % by weight\"); see also id. at Abstract (\"A process for obtaining therapeutically active \n2-[4-(3-and 2-(fluorobenzyloxy)benzylarnino]propanamides and their salts with pharmaceutically \nacceptable acids with high purity degree, in particular , with a content of dibenzyl derivatives \nimpurities lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % by weight.\"). The specification also \nincludes multiple examples relating to the chemical synthesis of safinamide or ralfinamide of a \n\"High Purity Degree.\" In those examples , the purity information related is the content of impurity \nIla or Ilb by weight. See id. at Examples 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. In view of these citations, Defendants ' \nassertion that \"[n]othing in the specification could possibly lead a POSA to believe that 'high \npurity' refers only to a low level of a specific impurity, such as Ila or Ilb\" is not persuasive. D.I. \n133 at 40. \n16 Defendants, after pointing out that there is \"no definition of 'high purity\"' in the \nspecification, turn to expert testimony to elucidate that term's meaning. Id. But that effort divorces \nclaim construction from the intrinsic record, and cannot be squared in view of the Federal Circuit's \nguidance that \"the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. \nUsually it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\" Phillips, \n415 F.3d at 1315 (quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, Defendants ' view that \"high purity\" refers \nto a \"'high' (but undefined) level of an overall chemical purity of a safinarnide preparation ,\" rather \nthan to any particular impurity, obtains considerably less support in the specification . D.I. 133 at \n40. \nDefendants also argue that, when applying Plaintiffs ' construction to certain unasserted \nclaims of the '515 patent, claim 29 takes on the same scope as claim 12. D.I. 133 at 47-48. Claim \n29 recites: \nThe process as in claim 12 wherein safinamide or ralfinamide or \ntheir pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, have a content of the \nrespective impurity (S)-2-3-(3-fluo robenzyl)-4-(3-\nfluorobenzyloxy)-benzylaminopropana mide (Ila) or (S)-2-3-(2 -\nfluorobenzyl)-4-(2-fluorobenzy loxy)-benzylaminopropanarnide \n(Ilb) [graphic omitted] or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid \nsalts, which is lower than 0.03% (by weight). \nClaim 12 recites: \nThe process as in claim 8 wherein the 4-(3-fluoroben \nZyloxy)benzaldehyde or 4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)benzalde hyde of \nformula (IV a) or (IVb) employed as the starting material to obtain \nthe Schiff base intermediate of formula (Vla) or (Vlb) contains less \nthan 0.03% (by weight), of the respective impurities 3-(3-\nfluorobenzyl)-4-(3-fluorobenzy loxy)benzaldehyde (Va) or 3-(2-\nfluorobenzyl)-4-(2-fluo robenzylox y)benzaldehyde (Vb) [graphic \nomitted] \n17 According to Defendants , the \"'only additional limitation in claim 29 is that the impurities Ila and \nIlb are limited to less than 0.03% by weight. If 'high purity' were defined as the limitation of these \ntwo specific impurities, this additional element in dependent claim 29 would not provide any \nfurther limitation.\" D.I. 133 at 48. But \"claim differentiation is a guide, not a rigid rule, and does \nnot alter a construction otherwise compelled by the intrinsic record.\" Ultravision Techs., LLC v. \nGovision, LLC, No. 2022-1098, 2023 WL 2182285, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 23, 2023) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the intrinsic record indicates that the scope the \npatentee ascribed to \"high purity\" is safinamide or ralfinamide preparations that have less than \n0.03% by weight of impurities Ila and Ilb and their salts. That the patentee also decided to claim \nwith greater particularity that safinamide or ralfinamide impurities are less than 0.03% by weight \nin claim 29 \"does not overcome that conclusion in these circumstances.\" Ultravision , 2023 WL \n2182285, at *4. \nAccordingly , the Court will construe the \"high purity\" terms to mean \"safinamide or \nralfinamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid salt thereof that has lower than 0.03% (by \nweight) of impurity IIa7 or impurity Ilb8 or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts.\" \nDefendants argue that, under Defendants ' proposed construction , the \"high purity\" terms \nare indefinite. D.I. 133 at 37-38. Defendants do not argue indefiniteness under Plaintiffs ' \nconstruction. As the Court has declined to adopt Defendants ' proposed construction, the Court \nconcludes the \"high purity\" terms are not indefinite . \nIV.

The hotel shut down in response the\n\n{\npandemic, and Plaintiff was forcefully evicted, despite having nowhere to go and,\nas a result of his age, being at high risk serious for serious complications or death\nfrom COVID-19. (DL. 1). Notably, he asserts that \u201c[t]his Court has personal\njurisdiction because the events giving rise to the matter in controversy occurred\nwithin the State of South Carolina and they occurred in Beaufort County South\nCarolina.\u201d (Jd. at { 194). He also expounds upon the connections of the Galdenzi\nDefendants and Beuafort County Defendants to the state of South Carolina for\npersonal jurisdiction purposes. (/d. at JJ 195, 197-99, 201-09).\n\nIn their motion to strike and dismiss, the Hotel Defendants argue the\nexpansive complaint fails to comply with Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, which requires \u201ca short plain statement of the claim showing that the\npleaders is entitled to relief.\u201d (D.I. 18 at 5-7). The motions to dismiss filed by the\nBeaufort County Defendants and Galdenzi Defendants argue both that this Court\nlacks personal jurisdiction over them, and that venue is improper in the District of\nDelaware. (D.I. 22 at 2-6; D.I. 47 at 5-10).\n\nIn February 2022, a month before filing this action, Plaintiff filed an\nessentially identical complaint in the District of South Carolina. See Wolffe v.\nGaldenzi, et al., No. 9:22-cv-00548 (D.S.C.). In March 2022, days before\ninitiating this action, he also filed an essentially identical complaint in the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, et al., No. 2:22-cv-994 (E.D.\n2\nPa.).! In September 2022, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the South Carolina\naction, with prejudice, indicating that he would instead proceed with his cases in\nPennsylvania and Delaware. See Wolffe, No. 9:22-cv-00548, D.I. 75.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania case, the Hotel Defendants filed a motion to strike and\ndismiss that was essentially identical to the motion they filed in this proceeding.\nAlso in the Pennsylvania case, the Beaufort County Defendants and Galdenzi\nDefendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction that were\nessentially identical to the motions they filed in this proceeding, except they of\ncourse argued that Pennsylvania, rather than Delaware, did not have personal\njurisdiction over them, and that the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was not the\nproper venue.\n\nIn October 2021, in the Pennsylvania case, the court granted the Beaufort\nCounty Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, noting that all of his arguments for\npersonal jurisdiction appeared to be repeated from his complaint in the South\nCarolina case and accordingly directed at South Carolina, and that \u201c[a]bsent from\nMr. Wolffe\u2019s complaint are allegations that the Beaufort County defendants have\nany contacts with Pennsylvania, or that any of the acts or omissions giving rise to\nthis action occurred in Pennsylvania. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, 2022 WL 14813700,\n| Plaintiff additionally filed an essentially identical complaint in Pennsylvania state\n\ncourt, which was removed to federal court and then consolidated with his federal\ncase. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, et al., No. 2:22-cv-2882 (E.D. Pa.).\n3\nat *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 2022) (emphasis original). The Court also concluded that\nvenue was not proper as to the Beaufort County Defendants. Jd. at *3-4. In\nNovember 2022, also in the Pennsylvania case, the court granted the Hotel\nDefendants motion to strike and dismiss, holding that \u201cMr. Wolffe\u2019s complaint is\nrife with redundant and verbose recitations of facts and rambling and unclear\nallegations, making it difficult to parse out which claims he is asserting against\nwhich defendants,\u201d and that \u201cWolffe\u2019s complaint fails to meet the Rule 8(a)(2)\nstandard requiring a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claims.\u201d Wolffe v. Galdenzi,\n2022 WL 16722318, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 4, 2022). The Galdenzi filed their\nmotion to dismiss in the Pennsylvania case in January 2023, but three days later,\nbefore the court ruled on the motion, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case,\nindicating that he would proceed with his claims in this Court. Wolffe v. Galdenzi,\net al., No. 2:22-cv-994, D.I. 61.\nI. LEGAL STANDARDS\n\nA. Rule 8(a)\n\nThe Court has the power to dismiss a complaint that fails to comply with\nRule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Ala\u2019 Ad-Din Bey v. United\nStates DOJ, 457 F. App\u2019x 90, 91 (3d Cir. Jan. 11, 2012) (per curiam) (affirming\ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal). Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nrequires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\n4\nentitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Each averment must be \"simple,\nconcise, and direct.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). \u201cTaken together,\u201d Rules 8(a) and\n8(d)(1) \u201cunderscore the emphasis placed on clarity and brevity by the federal\npleading rules.\u201d In re: Westinghouse Sec. Litig., 90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(citation omitted). Dismissal pursuant to Rule 8 has been found warranted where a\ncomplaint is rambling, unclear, and/or unwieldy. See Trillo v. Kent, 477 F. App\u2019x\n881, 882 (3d Cir. Sept. 6, 2012) (per curiam). Dismissal under Rule 8 has also\nbeen held proper when a complaint \u201cleft the defendants having to guess what of the\nmany things discussed constituted [a cause of action].\u201d Binsack v. Lackawanna\nCnty. Prison, 438 F. App\u2019x 158, 160 (3d Cir. July 21, 2011) (per curiam).\n\nB. Rule 12(b)(2)\n\nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court\nmay dismiss a suit for lack of jurisdiction over the person. Although Rule 8 does\nnot require a plaintiff to set forth in the complaint \u201cthe grounds upon which the\ncourt has personal jurisdiction over the defendant,\u201d Hansen v. Neumueller GmbH,\n163 F.R.D. 471, 474 (D. Del. 1995), \u201conce a defendant has raised a jurisdictional\ndefense, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving by affidavits or other competent\nevidence that jurisdiction is proper.\u201d Dayhoff Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co., 86 F.3d 1287,\n1302 (3d Cir. 1996). If the district court does not hold an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ncourt should resolve any factual disputes in the plaintiffs favor and should deny\n\n5\nthe motion if the plaintiff's evidence establishes \u201ca prima facie case of personal\njurisdiction.\u201d Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAlliance Pharma SA, 623 F.3d\n147, 155 (3d Cir. 2010).\n\nTwo requirements, one statutory and one constitutional, must be satisfied for\npersonal jurisdiction to exist over a defendant. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. C\n& C Helicopter Sales, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 400, 403 (D. Del. 2002). \u201cFirst, a\nfederal district court may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state\nin which the court sits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.\u201d Jd. (citing\nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)). The Court must, therefore, determine whether there is a\nstatutory basis for jurisdiction under the Delaware long-arm statute. Jd. (citing 10\nDel. C. \u00a7 3104(c)). \u201cSecond, because the exercise of jurisdiction must also\ncomport with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the Court\nmust determine if an exercise of jurisdiction violates [Defendant\u2019s] constitutional\nright to due process.\u201d Jd. (citing International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S.\n310 (1945)).\n\n\u201cOnce a jurisdictional defense has been raised, the plaintiff bears the burden\nof establishing with reasonable particularity that sufficient minimum contacts have\noccurred between the defendant and the forum state to support jurisdiction.\u201d Jd.\n(citing Provident Nat\u2019! Bank v. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 819 F.2d 434,\n\n437 (3d Cir. 1987). Plaintiff may establish jurisdictional facts through sworn\n6\naffidavits or other competent evidence. See Time Share Vacation Club v. Atlantic\nResorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d 61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\nPlaintiff must demonstrate either specific or general jurisdiction. Specific\njurisdiction arises when the particular cause of action arose from Defendant\u2019s\nactivities within the forum state. In contrast, general jurisdiction does not require\nDefendant\u2019s connections be related to the particular cause of action, but that\nDefendants have continuous or systematic contacts with the forum state. American\nBio Medica Corp. v. Peninsula Drug Analysis Co, Inc., 1999 WL 615175 (D. Del.\n1999). \u201c[A]t no point may a plaintiff rely on the bare pleadings alone in order to\nwithstand a defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of in personam\njurisdiction.\u201d Jd. Plaintiff is required to respond to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction with actual proof, not mere allegations. Id.\nSee also Hurley v. Cancun Playa Oasis In\u2019tl Hotels, 1999 WL 718556, at *1 (E.D.\nPa. Aug. 31, 1999) (stating that \u201c[g]eneral averments in an unverified complaint or\nresponse without the support of sworn affidavits or other competent evidence are\ninsufficient to establish jurisdictional facts\u201d).\n\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe Court will adopt the reasoning of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nand grant Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The Court agrees that the Hotel\n\nDefendants and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that dismissal without\n\n7\nprejudice of the approximately 600-page complaint under Rule 8(a) is appropriate.\nSee Trillo, 477 F. App\u2019x at 882 (affirming dismissal under Rule 8(a) of \u201crambling\nand unclear\u201d complaint); Wolffe, 2022 WL 16722318, at *2 (holding that \u201cMr.\nWolffe\u2019s complaint is rife with redundant and verbose recitations of facts and\nrambling and unclear allegations, making it difficult to parse out which claims he\nis asserting against which defendants\u201d).\n\nThe Court also adopts the reasoning of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nand the Beaufort County Defendants and holds both that personal jurisdiction is\nlacking over these Defendants and that venue is not proper in this Court. See\nWolffe, 2022 WL 14813700, at *3 (\u201cAbsent from Mr. Wolffe\u2019s complaint are\nallegations that the Beaufort County defendants have any contacts with\n[Delaware], or that any of the acts or omissions giving rise to this action occurred\nin [Delaware].\u201d). Finally, the Court will adopt the same reasoning with regard to\nthe Galdenzi Defendants. See Id.\n\nPlaintiffs pending motions for removal of attorneys of record for fraud on\nthe Court, and to compel an investigation for fraud on the Court, will denied as\nfrivolous. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, 2022 WL 14813702 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 2022)\n\n(denying essentially identically motions as frivolous).\nVv. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant the Hotel Defendants\u2019\nmotion to strike and dismiss (D.I. 17); (2) grant the Beaufort County Defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss (D.I. 21); (3) grant the Galdenzi Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\n(D.I. 46); and (4) deny Plaintiff's pending motions (D.I. 51, 53). Plaintiff will be\ngiven leave to file an amended complaint against the Hotel Defendants.\n\nAn appropriate order will be entered.\n"}, {"case_name": "Marquinez et al v.

Civil Action No. 12-cv-695-RGA-SRF\nDOLE FOOD COMPANY INC. et al., 5\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nAt Wilmington this 14th day of April, 2023, the court having considered the parties\u2019\nsubmissions regarding Luis Antonio Aguilar Marquinez, et al. (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) Motion to Allocate\nin Whole or in Part the Court Appointed Expert Witness Costs (\u201cMotion\u201d), (D.I. 419), IT IS\nHEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is DENIED for the reasons discussed below:\n\n1. Background.\u201d This motion concems the allocation of costs for a court appointed\nexpert witness on Ecuadorian law. In Chavez and Marquinez, motions for summary judgment\n\nwere filed in the mass toxic tort case by the participating Defendants\u2019 concerning the Ecuadorian\n\n' The briefing for the pending Motion is as follows: Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion and opening brief (D.I.\n419), Defendants\u2019 answering brief (D.I. 426), and Plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief (D.I. 429). In addition,\nthe expert witness, Professor Angel R. Oquendo, submitted a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion.\n(D.I. 427)\n\n2 This case was consolidated with eight other cases pending in this district and was designated as\nlead on December 5, 2019. (D.I. 195; see No. 12-695-RGA-SRF; No. 12-696-RGA; No. 12-\n697-RGA-SRF; No. 12-698-RGA; No. 12-699-RGA; No. 12-700-RGA; No. 12-701-RGA; and\nNo. 12-702-RGA) This case and Chavez et al. v. Dole Food Company, Inc., et al, No. 12-697-\nRGA-SRF are relevant to the present Motion as they concern the Ecuadorian Plaintiffs.\n\n3 Participating Defendants include: (1) Dole Food Co. Inc., Dole Fresh Fruit Co., Standard Fruit\nCompany, and Standard Fruit and Steamship Company, who filed for summary judgment in\nChavez (D.I. 333); (2) Dow Chemical Company, Occidental Chemical Corp., AMVAC Chemical\nCorp., and Shell Oil Co., who filed for summary judgment in Marquinez (D.1. 354); and (3)\nChiquita Brands Int\u2019! Inc., Chiquita Fresh N. Am. LLC, and Chiquita Brands LLC, who joined in\nthe aforementioned summary judgment motions (D.I. 355). Defendant Del Monte Fresh Produce\nN.A. Inc. is not a participating Defendant for purposes of this Motion. (D.I. 426 at 1 n.1)\nPlaintiffs who claim to have been injured as a result of alleged exposure to an agricultural\nchemical called dibromochloropropane (\u201cDBCP\u201d) while working on banana farms. (D.I. 333;\nD.L 354; see D.I. 1 at J] 5, 104-05) The Ecuadorian Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary\njudgment. (D.I. 339) The summary judgment motions contained conflicting expert declarations\nregarding the application of Ecuadorian law. (D.I. 341; D.I. 356-1, Ex. B; D.I. 360-2, Ex. 2)\n\n2. On August 5, 2021, the Honorable Richard G. Andrews ordered the parties to\nmeet and confer and nominate an expert to assist the court in answering whether a protection\naction under Ecuadorian constitutional law is an appropriate mechanism for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n(D.I. 383) The parties recommended Professor Angel R. Oquendo. (D.I. 387) The court\nrequired a neutral expert to resolve the conflict between both sides\u2019 experts on (1) whether a\nplaintiff could bring a protection action for events that occurred prior to 2008, the date the\nEcuadorian Constitution was adopted, and (2) whether Plaintiffs\u2019 claims could appropriately be\nbrought as a protection action. (D.I. 388 at 2) The court appointed Professor Oquendo and\ntasked him \u201cto opine on matters of Ecuadorian law relevant to the applicability of the Delaware\nBorrowing Statute.\u201d (D.I. 389 at J 1)\n\n3. The court ordered the parties to compensate Professor Oquendo as follows:\n\nProfessor Oquendo shall be compensated for his services at his usual hourly rate. Others\n\nassisting him shall be compensated at their usual hourly rates. Professor Oquendo shall\n\nsend itemized statements for services and expenses directly to counsel for the parties after\nthe completion of his report, and he shall receive payment directly from counsel for the\nparties in a timely fashion. The compensation and expenses of Professor Oquendo shall,\nunless otherwise ordered, be shared equally by the parties (that is, 50% by Plaintiffs and\n\n50% by the relevant Defendants). Any objections or disputes as to Professor Oquendo\u2019s\n\ncompensation, costs, and/or expenses shall be presented to the Court in a timely\n\napplication.\n\n(Id. at | 5 (emphasis added))\n4. On December 14, 2021, Professor Oquendo submitted his report. (D.I. 393)\nDefendants then desired to depose Professor Oquendo. (D.I. 396) On January 21, 2022, the\ncourt ordered that Defendants should bear one hundred percent of the cost for the deposition\nunless Plaintiffs questioned Professor Oquendo \u201cmore than a de minimis amount,\u201d in which\nDefendants could move to seek a proportionate contribution from the Plaintiffs. (D.I. 398)\n\n5. More than eight months after issuing his expert report, Professor Oquendo was\nstill owed Plaintiffs\u2019 half of his expert witness fees. Therefore, on August 19, 2022, the court\nissued a Show Cause Order requiring the Plaintiffs to demonstrate why they should not be\nsanctioned for withholding their fifty percent share. (D.I. 411) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded\nthat they had good cause to withhold payment because they intended to challenge Professor\nOquendo\u2019s fees but did not want to do so until after his expert deposition so as not to risk biasing\nProfessor Oquendo against Plaintiffs in offering his opinion on highly contested legal questions.\n(I. 414)\n\n6. Professor Oquendo\u2019s deposition took place on September 19, 2022. (D.I. 426, Ex.\nA) On September 30, 2022, the court held the Show Cause Hearing, and the Plaintiffs deposited\ntheir fifty percent share, which totaled $168,898.00, with the court. (D.I. 416; see also docket\nentry dated October 13, 2022) On October 14, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed the present Motion and\n\nthe court discharged the Show Cause Order. (D.I. 418; D.I. 419)\n\n4 Defendants say the Plaintiffs spent more than a de minimus amount of time questioning the\nexpert, about 18% of the deposition time, but Defendants have not moved for contribution from\nPlaintiffs towards the deposition fees charged by Professor Oquendo. (D.I. 426 at 5 n.7; see D.L.\n398)\n7. Legal Standard. Pursuant to the Federal Rule of Evidence 706(c)(2), a court\nappointed expert witness \u201cis entitled to a reasonable compensation, as set by the court. This\ncompensation is payable . . . by the parties in the proportion and at the time that the court\ndirects\u2014and the compensation is then charged like other costs.\u201d\n\n8. Plaintiffs now move to shift the entire expense of the court appointed expert\u2019s\nreport to the Defendants. Plaintiffs\u2019 rationale is that the Defendants were the \u201cprime movers\u201d\ncreating the need for the expert\u2019s opinion because Defendants disputed whether Plaintiffs could\nbring a protection action. (D.J. 419 at 2-6) Plaintiffs contend that the expert supports their\nposition, therefore, it was a needless expense for resolving an issue that should not have been\nchallenged. (/d.) In addition, the Plaintiffs claim they are indigent, and the Defendants have\ngreater resources, so it is not unreasonable for the Defendants to bear the full expense for the\nexpert\u2019s report. (/d. at 4-5) Alternatively, Plaintiffs ask the court to reduce the fees charged by\nthe expert. (/d. at 6-7) The court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on all grounds as discussed, infra.\n\n9. The Expert\u2019s Opinions Were Necessary to Assist the Court. The Plaintiffs\nargue that the Defendants should bear the entire cost of Professor Oquendo\u2019s fees because the\nDefendants\u2019 litigation position, that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were time barred, inter alia, caused the\nneed for the expert\u2019s report. (D.I. 419 at 2-6) Moreover, the ultimate opinions offered by the\nexpert favored Plaintiffs\u2019 position on the disputed issues of Ecuadorian law. (/d.) Plaintiffs\nargue that shifting the cost is appropriate and tracks the rationale for the court\u2019s order that\nDefendants pay the full cost of the expert\u2019s deposition. (Jd. at 3)\n\n10. The court is not persuaded by the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Defendants should\nbear the entire cost because they unreasonably took a position that necessitated the court\u2019s\n\nretention of the expert. The case on which Plaintiffs rely does not support their position for cost-\nshifting based on unfavorable outcome and instead supports the court\u2019s original equal\napportionment. (See D.I. 419 at 5) See Leesona Corp. v. Varta Batteries, Inc., 522 F. Supp.\n1304, 1312 n.21 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (noting that the court appointed expert was \u201cpaid in equal\nshares by plaintiff and defendant\u201d).\n\n11. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defendants caused the parties to incur an unnecessary\nexpense for the expert fails to acknowledge that Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in both\nthe Marquinez and Chavez cases, thus, a conflict in application of Ecuadorian law was presented\nfor which the court required an expert. The court needed to identify the applicable statute of\nlimitations for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Ecuadorian law in order to apply the Delaware Borrowing\nStatute. Due to both sides\u2019 conflicting interpretation of Ecuadorian law, the court acted within\nits discretion under Rule 706 to appoint a neutral expert and apportion the expense between the\nparties.\n\n12. Defendants complied with the court\u2019s Order assessing them with the total cost of\nthe expert\u2019s deposition because Defendants noticed the deposition. (D.I. 410) Defendants\u2019\npayment has no bearing on Plaintiffs\u2019 compliance with their obligations under the court\u2019s\noriginal order apportioning expenses for the expert\u2019s report.\n\n13. Furthermore, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that expert witness fees should be assessed\nagainst the side the opinion allegedly disfavors is unpersuasive and lacks any authority\nemploying such a calculation based on hindsight. Professor Oquendo provided his expert\nopinion, and it remains for the court to determine how it affects the viability of the Ecuadorian\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n14. Plaintiffs Failed to Demonstrate that Payment of their Share of Fees for the\nExpert Would Pose an Undue Burden. The Plaintiffs argue that they are \u201cimpecunious,\u201d so\njustice requires shifting costs to the Defendant corporations which \u201chave far more resources to\nbear this expense.\u201d (D.I. 419 at 4-5) Plaintiffs briefly argue that the cost \u201cplac[es] a substantial\nburden on Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s resources to prosecute this litigation.\u201d (/d. at 6 n.3; see also D.I.\n429 at 4) The court will not entertain arguments placed in a footnote nor will it infer that a\nfinancial hardship is present without supporting evidence. Plaintiffs have already deposited their\nfifty percent share of Professor Oquendo\u2019s fees with the court, so they have demonstrated their\nability to pay their allocated share.\n\n15. When the court entered an Order allocating the costs of the expert to be \u201cshared\nequally by the parties,\u201d it left open the opportunity to raise \u201c[a]ny objections or disputes as to\nProfessor Oquendo\u2019s compensation . . . in a timely application.\u201d (D.I. 389 at ] 5) Plaintiffs did\nnot voice concern that allocating them with an equal share of the expense would be unduly\nburdensome or constrain their ability to litigate their case. Further, Plaintiffs did not object to the\nallocation, nor did they ask to defer allocation until the expert issued his opinion. The Plaintiffs\nhave long been on notice of the court\u2019s allocation of the fees. They chose to avoid paying their\nshare until the court resorted to a Show Cause Order and finally ordered them to deposit their\nshare with the court. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to re-allocate the cost based on financial\nburden is unpersuasive.\n\n16. The court also finds that Plaintiffs have failed to support their cost-shifting\nargument with binding authority from the Third Circuit. The cases cited by Plaintiffs are from\ncourts outside of this circuit and do not address re-apportionment of costs for the court appointed\n\nexpert once the court has ordered an equal allocation. (See D.I. 419 at 3-5) The cases that\nPlaintiffs cite are distinguishable in that they involve court appointed medical experts to render\nopinions on injuries alleged by prisoners in civil rights actions. See e.g., Claiborne v. Blauser,\n934 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2019) (discussing Rule 706 in the context of a court appointed\nmedical expert in a prisoner\u2019s civil rights action); Ledford v. Sullivan, 105 F.3d 354, 359-60 (7th\nCir. 1997) (affirming the district court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiff's request to appoint a\ncourt expert to opine on the plaintiff's medical condition in a civil rights action); McKinney v.\nAnderson, 924 F.2d 1500, 1510-11 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. granted, judgment vacated on other\ngrounds, 502 U.S. 903 (1991), on remand, judgment reinstated, 959 F.2d 853, 854 (9th Cir.\n1992) (recommending that the district court appoint an expert witness to opine on the health\neffects and concentration levels of secondary cigarette smoke in the prisoner\u2019s civil rights\naction). These cases are inapplicable to the present situation because, in prisoner civil rights\ncases, medical experts are necessary for the indigent plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of proof on\ndamages. Such is not the case here regarding Professor Oquendo\u2019s expert opinion on Ecuadorian\nlaw.\n\n17. The Court Finds the Expert Witness Fees are Reasonable. Alternatively, the\nPlaintiffs move for a reduction of the fees billed by Professor Oquendo and his assistant, Claudia\nSchubert, because the hours billed for preparing the report are excessive and unreasonable. (D.I.\n419 at 6-7) Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the court should evaluate the expert\u2019s fees by the\nsame standard it applies to the fees charged by a Special Master. (Jd. at 7)\n\n18. Fees billed by Special Masters bear no relationship to fees billed by a court\nappointed expert because Special Masters are not subject to Rule 706. It remains within the\ncourt\u2019s discretion to allocate costs for a court appointed expert. Moreover, the role of a Special\n\nMaster is akin to that of a judicial officer not an expert witness. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument ignores the\ndistinction and lacks any supporting authority.\n\n19. Professor Oquendo and Schubert billed the parties $337,796 for approximately\n432 hours of work during the months of October of 2021 through December of 2021, resulting in\ncompletion of a 30-page report. (D.I. 419, Ex. A; D.I. 393) The court asked Professor Oquendo\nto respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion challenging his expert witness fees. (D.I. 424) In his response,\nProfessor Oquendo explains that his report \u201cdelves deeper\u201d than the report of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert in\nopining on the issues in the pending case. (D.I. 427 at 1) Professor Oquendo did not pull up the\ncases on both sides of the issue and decide between them. Rather, \u201c[iJn pursuit of reliability for\n[the] assessment, [he and his assistant] stud[ied] the totality of [the issues] and develop[ed] an\nanalytic scheme.\u201d (Jd. at 2) In fact, Professor Oquendo could find no direct authority on point\naddressing the disputed issues for which he was retained. (D.I. 426, Ex. A at 133:21-134:17;\n195:23-196:14 (discussing that the Constitutional Court has not spoken on whether a protection\naction could be retroactively applied to conduct that occurred before the adoption of the\nEcuadorian Constitution)) Professor Oquendo states in his declaration that he worked on seven\nprior cases researching similar issues of Ecuadorian law, and in six of them he expended more\nhours than he did here. (D.I. 427 at 1)\n\n20. Plaintiffs questioned Professor Oquendo about the charges on his bill ina\nvideoconference specifically for that purpose and, later, at his deposition. (/d. at 4-5; D.I. 426,\nEx. A at 211:11-24) In their Motion, Plaintiffs fail to mention their questioning of Professor\nOquendo on either occasion. Plaintiffs fail to substantively respond to Professor Oquendo\u2019s\nexplanation in defense of his fees. Plaintiffs argue generally that the hours expended on the\nexpert report were unreasonable, but they provide no facts to support their position. Plaintiffs do\n\nnot suggest any analytic framework for auditing the reasonableness of the number of hours billed\nnor have they provided a declaration attesting to the hours reasonably necessary to provide the\nexpert report ordered by the court. Plaintiffs simply provide a comparison of the hours billed by\nProfessor Oquendo\u2019s team with the number of hours billed by the Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Maria\nMifio. (D.I. 419 at 6) Dr. Mifio billed a total of $7,500 for 25 hours of work to complete a 10-\npage report. (/d.) A superficial comparison of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s bill to the court appointed\nexpert\u2019s bill is a thin basis on which to avoid payment of their allocated share which the court\nappropriately ordered in the exercise of its discretion.\n\n21. Plaintiffs complain that Professor Oquendo addressed more issues than were\nnecessary compared to the issues addressed by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert Dr. Mifio. (/d.) The argument\nmisses the point that Professor Oquendo was appointed by the court and his report conforms to\nthe scope of duties set by the court. Therefore, the court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to\ndemonstrate that the number of hours billed by Professor Oquendo and Schubert were\nunreasonable, and therefore, denies Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to reduce Professor Oquendo\u2019s bill for\nexpert witness fees.\n\n22. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is DENIED. (D.L\n419) An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.

(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) against Defendants Earl George (d/b/a\nEden Salt, Inc., Eden Salt LLC, Eden Salt and Eden Import and Exports), and Eden Import &\nExport LLC (d/b/a Eden Salt Import and Export LLC and Eden Salt), and Serving With a\nMission (collectively, the \u201cDefaulting Defendants\u201d). (D.I. 30)! For the following reasons, I\nrecommend that the court GRANT Plaintiff's motion for entry of default judgment under Rule\n\n55(b)(2) and issue a permanent injunction against the Defaulting Defendants.\n\n! The briefing and other filings associated with the pending motion for default judgment are\nfound at D.I. 31, D.I. 32, D.L. 33, and D.I. 35.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff began as a food co-operative in the mid to late 1960s, and after finding initial\nsuccess with its organic retail food store, it began branding its own organic food products under\nthe \u201cEden\u201d trademark around 1969. (D.I. 33 at {] 4-5) Plaintiff has operated continuously since\nthen and continues to use its \u201cEden\u201d trademark and brand name. (D.I. 33 at J 5)\n\nFor more than twenty years Plaintiff has sold \u201cEden\u201d branded salt. (D.I. 33 at | 19)\nThree of Plaintiff\u2019s marks specifically relate to salts sold under the Eden\u00ae family of trademarks:\nRegistration Nos. 1,452,337 (\u201cthe 2337 mark\u201d), 1,862,634 (\u201cthe \u2019634 mark\u201d), and 3,071,337\n(\u201cthe \u20191337 mark\u201d). (D.I. 15 at J 26-7, 33) Plaintiff first registered a mark relating to salt in\n1987, with the 2337 mark registering \u201cEden\u201d as a trademark for food and beverage products\nincluding \u201csea salt for table use.\u201d (D.I. 33 at \u00a7 20) Plaintiff registered the \u201cEden\u201d trademark for\nadditional food and beverages, including \u201csea salt\u201d in 1994 under the 634 mark. (D.L. 33 at J\n20) Plaintiff also registered \u201cEden Foods\u201d as a trademark for \u201csalt\u201d in 2006 with the 1337 mark.\n(D.I. 33 at \u00a7 20) All of these trademarks have been duly renewed and remain in effect. (D.I. 33\nat { 20)\n\nOn January 12, 2022, the Defaulting Defendants submitted an application to the United\nStates Patent & Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") for the trademark \u201cEden Salt.\u201d (D.I. 32-1 at 2)\nWithin this trademark application, the Defaulting Defendants indicated that \u201cEden Salt\u201d had\nbeen used in commerce since May 7, 2021. (/d.) The Defaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark\napplication also stated the applicant has used the trademark \u201cEden Salt\u201d in interstate commerce\nat least as early as July 5, 2021. (D.I. 15 at | 64) This trademark application was signed by\n\u201cEarl George\u201d and listed Eden Salt\u2019s office address as 501 Silverside Rd., PBM#371,\n\nWilmington, Delaware 19809. (D.I. 32 at { 7)\nThereafter, Plaintiff sent two letters to Andrea Selkregg (\u201cSelkregg\u201d), the attorney who\nfiled the Eden Salt trademark application, asking her to provide details on the identity of her\nclient. (D.I. 32 at 10) A letter to Selkregg dated February 4, 2022, represented that the\nDefaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark application for Eden Salt likely infringed Plaintiff's family of\nEden Foods marks. (D.I. 15 at (66) Selkregg indicated she forwarded the information to her\nclient and stated that she did not represent Eden Salt in the trademark dispute with Eden Foods.\n(DL. 32 at \u00a2 11) On March 8, 2022, Plaintiff contacted Selkregg again to request contact\ninformation for a principal or officer of Eden Salt. (D.I. 32 at ] 12) Selkregg indicated that she\nhad forwarded the information to her client but declined to provide any more information. (Jd.)\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Plaintiff contacted the number listed on the Defaulting Defendants\u2019\nwebsite to obtain information about their directors and officers. (D.I. 32 at 13) The person\nwho answered the phone identified himself only as \u201cPresident\u201d of Eden Salt. (/d.) This\nindividual stated he was represented by counsel in the trademark dispute between Eden Salt and\nEden Foods, but he declined to identify his counsel. (/d.) Plaintiffs counsel was unable to\nengage further given that the individual claimed to be represented by counsel. (/d.)\n\nOn March 30, 2022, Plaintiff commenced this action against the Defaulting Defendants\nalleging that they used Plaintiff\u2019s marks as part of their trademark application for \u201cEDEN\nSALT,\u201d in their trade and domain names, and in the distribution and marketing of their salt\nproducts at the wholesale and/or retail level. (D.I. 1 at Ff 40-44; D.I. 15 at J] 50-54) About a\nweek after the complaint was filed, the court entered an order permitting Plaintiff to serve\nlimited, expedited discovery to ascertain the identities of the Defaulting Defendants. (D.I. 9)\n\nPlaintiff then filed a first amended complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) on May 27, 2022, which names the\nDefaulting Defendants and is otherwise substantively the same as the original complaint. (D.I.\n15 at ff] 4-5)\n\nThe record before the court indicates Plaintiff served the FAC and summons on\ndefendant Serving With A Mission by way of its receiving agent on June 9, 2022. (D.I. 19) The\nfollowing day, Plaintiff served the FAC and summons on the authorized agent of Earl George\nand Eden Import & Export LLC. (D.I. 17; D.I. 18) The Defaulting Defendants failed to file and\nserve a timely responsive pleading as required under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\n\nShortly before the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 responsive pleading deadline expired, Plaintiff\nrepresented on the record that it had faced significant hurdles in serving the Defaulting\nDefendants, and it had not been able to personally serve Earl George or Eden Import & Export\nLLC. (DL 20; D.I. 21) On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed two affidavits of service detailing its\nadditional attempts to personally serve Earl George and Eden Import & Export LLC at Earl\nGeorge\u2019s Brooklyn apartment, ending with the process server posting the summons and FAC on\nthe door of the apartment on July 20, 2022, and mailing the summons and FAC to two Brooklyn\naddresses the following day. (D.I. 24; D.I. 25)\n\nOn August 18, 2022, the court entered a default in appearance against the Defaulting\nDefendants, finding that service was effectuated based on the executed summonses, the affidavits\nof service, and the representations made in the declaration accompanying the request for entry of\ndefault. (D.I. 28; D.I. 29) The court also allowed Plaintiff to issue subpoenas to any registrar for\nthe edensalt.com domain. (D.I. 28)\n\nPlaintiff filed the pending motion for entry of default judgment pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2)\n\non September 12, 2022. (D.I. 30) The assigned District Judge referred the pending motion to\nthe undersigned judicial officer on October 21, 2022. (D.I. 34) On November 1, 2022, Plaintiff\nfiled a letter confirming that the USPTO refused to register \u201cEden Salt\u201d due to a likelihood of\nconfusion with Plaintiff's marks. (D.I. 35)\n\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) provides that a district court may enter default\njudgment against a party when default has been entered by the Clerk of Court. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n55(b). The decision to enter a default judgment is within the discretion of the court. Tristrata\nTech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Rsch., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010) (citing Hritz v.\nWoma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180 (3d Cir. 1984)). The court\u2019s determination is guided by three\nconsiderations: \u201c(1) prejudice to the plaintiff if default is denied, (2) whether the defendant\nappears to have a litigable defense, and (3) whether defendant\u2019s delay is due to culpable\nconduct.\u201d Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000). \u201cA consequence of the\nentry of a default judgment is that the factual allegations of the complaint, except those relating\nto the amount of damages, will be taken as true.\u201d Comdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142,\n1149 (3d Cir. 1990); see J & J Sports Prod., Inc. v. Kim, C.A. No. 14-1170-LPS, 2016 WL\n1238223, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2016).\n\nThe court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the amount of damages or\nestablish the truth of the allegations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). However, \u201cRule 55 does not\nrequire that testimony be presented as a prerequisite to the entry of a default judgment[.J]\u201d 10A\nC. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2688 (3d ed. 2007); see Rhino Assocs.,\nL.P. v. Berg Mfg. & Sales Corp., 531 F. Supp. 2d 652, 657 (M.D. Pa. 2007). Plaintiff seeks only\ninjunctive relief in this instance, and for the reasons set forth below, the uncontroverted factual\n\nallegations in the FAC obviate the need for a hearing to substantiate Plaintiff's proposed\npermanent injunction. See S.E.C. v. Krimm, C.A. No. 17-464-RDM, 2019 WL 2270437, at *5\n(D. Del. May 28, 2019) (granting proposed injunctive relief without a hearing on a motion for\ndefault judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)).\nIl. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Default Judgment\n\nI recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default judgment against the\nDefaulting Defendants. As described at \u00a7 I, supra, Plaintiff served the FAC on the Defaulting\nDefendants, who failed to answer or otherwise respond, and the Clerk of Court entered a default\nin appearance against the Defaulting Defendants. Accordingly, the court takes as true the\nunchallenged factual allegations in the FAC, which plausibly establish the Defaulting\nDefendants\u2019 use of Plaintiff's marks will cause a likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act.\nSee Comdyne I, 908 F.2d at 1149; A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237\nF.3d 198, 202 (3d Cir. 2000) (explaining that trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\nand unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A) are measured by identical standards).\nThe plausibility of Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims extends to the remaining claims brought under\nDelaware state and common law. See Acxiom Corp. v. Axiom, Inc., 27 F. Supp. 2d 478, 506-07\n(D. Del. 1998) (finding it unnecessary to determine whether Axiom\u2019s actions infringed under the\nLanham Act and under Delaware state law or common law because the state law claims are\nsimilar to their federal counterparts in both scope and remedy); see also Mil. Certified\nResidential Specialist, LLC v. Fairway Indep. Mortg. Corp., 251 F. Supp. 3d 750 (D. Del. 2017);\nsee also S&P Glob. Inc. v. S&P Data LLC, C.A. No. 20-701-RGA, 2022 WL 3098096 at *17 n.2\n\n(D. Del. Aug. 4, 2022).\nMoreover, the factors articulated by the Third Circuit in Chamberlain weigh in favor of\ndefault judgment against the Defaulting Defendants. See Chamberlain, 210 F.3d at 164. First,\nPlaintiff has shown it will be prejudiced by its inability to enforce its marks if the motion is\ndenied because the Defaulting Defendants have been unresponsive to Plaintiff's efforts to\ncommunicate and will likely continue to infringe Plaintiff's trademarks. (D.I. 15 at ff 64-68);\nsee Tristrata Tech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Rsch., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010)\n(finding prejudice resulting from inability to enforce patent rights or recover damages). Denial\nof default judgment will prejudice Plaintiff by precluding \u201cany effective avenue for obtaining\nrelief[.]\u201d Roy v. Sakhr Software Co. (K.S.C.C.), C.A. No. 11-863-LPS, 2015 WL 4608132, at *2\n(D. Del. July 31, 2015).\n\nThe second Chamberlain factor also weighs in favor of default judgment. Whether the\nDefaulting Defendants have a litigable defense is unclear due to their failure to appear and\nparticipate in the litigation. See Tristrata, 270 F.R.D. at 164. The strength of Plaintiff's pleaded\nallegations on the likelihood of confusion also reduces the odds that the Defaulting Defendants\ncould present a meritorious defense. Plaintiff's registered marks \u201cEDEN\u201d and \u201cEDEN FOODS\u201d\nare facially similar to the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 name \u201cEden Salt.\u201d See Javo Beverage Co.,\nInc. v. Javy Coffee Co., C.A. No. 22-547-RGA, 2023 WL 387587, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 25, 2023)\n(finding a likelihood of confusion to be plausible between \u201cJavo\u201d and \u201cJavy\u201d). This similarity is\nfurther confirmed by the USPTO\u2019s rejection of the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark application\nfor \u201cEden Salt\u201d based on the likelihood of confusion with Plaintiffs marks. (D.I. 35 at 2-3) The\nfactual allegations in the FAC also establish Plaintiff's decades-long use of its marks in the food\nmarket, (D.I. 15 at ff 25-27, 33); the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 marketing of their products through\n\nthe same channels as Plaintiff, (id. at \u00a2 70; see also D.I. 33 at \u00a7 26-27; D.I. 32 at \u00a2 33); and the\nDefaulting Defendants\u2019 continued use of Plaintiff's marks despite actual knowledge of them.\n(D.I. 15 at FJ 66, 69-71)\n\nThe third and final Chamberlain factor weighs in favor of default judgment because the\nDefaulting Defendants have been on notice of this action, and their decision not to defend against\nthe allegations in the FAC amounts to willful and culpable conduct. See Krimm, 2019 WL\n2270437, at *5. Plaintiff has reached out to the Defaulting Defendants on several occasions,\nsending notice of their infringement, following up with the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 trademark\nattorney, and calling the \u201cEden Salt\u201d number listed on the website. (D.I. 15 at {J 66-68)\nNonetheless, the Defaulting Defendants have responded with evasiveness. (/d.; D.I. 32 at 4 11-\n13, 28-31) For these reasons, I recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default\njudgment under Rule 55(b)(2).\n\nB. Permanent Injunction\n\nPlaintiff asks the court to permanently enjoin the Defaulting Defendants\u2019 conduct. (D.I.\n30 at 1) The court may award injunctive relief under the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116.\nGenerally, a party prevailing on the merits must show four factors to obtain a permanent\ninjunction: (1) it will suffer irreparable injury; (2) no remedy available at law would be\nsufficient; (3) the balance of hardships tips in its favor; and (4) the injunction would serve public\ninterests. TD Bank N.A. v. Hill, 928 F.3d 259, 278 (3d Cir. 2019). In the \u201cspecialized context\u201d\nof a default judgment, where the defendant does not respond and the plaintiff cannot quantify its\ndamages, these factors generally weigh in favor of injunctive relief. See Ottomanson, Inc. v.\nUCAI, LLC, 2020 WL 205945, at *4 (D.N.J. Jan. 10, 2020) (\u201cMerely enjoining infringement\ndoes not deprive the defendant of anything to which it is entitled, and it is in the public interest to\n\ndo so.\u201d).\nBecause liability for trademark infringement and unfair competition has been established\nand Plaintiff has shown that future violations are likely, the court may issue a permanent\ninjunction. See Krimm, 2019 WL 2270437, at *6 (issuing permanent injunctive relief on a\nmotion for default judgment because defendants did not respond to the complaint or otherwise\nrepresent that future violations were unlikely); see also Innovative Office Prods., Inc. v.\nAmazon.com, Inc., 2012 WL 1466512, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 26, 2012) (issuing a permanent\ninjunction based on acceptance of infringement allegation as true for purposes of the motion for\ndefault judgment). Consequently, I recommend that the court issue a permanent injunction\nagainst the Defaulting Defendants consistent with the relief sought at paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of\nPlaintiff's proposed order. (D.I. 30-1 at f{ 4-5, 7)\n\nHowever, Plaintiff's proposed order seeks a broad spectrum of injunctive relief. I\nrecommend that the court deny the relief sought at paragraphs 6, 8, and 9 of Plaintiff's proposed\norder because these requests for relief are not adequately supported by the record and the\napplicable case authorities. (D.I. 30-1 at ff 6, 8-9)\n\nI recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs requested relief at paragraph 6 of the\nproposed order, which seeks a transfer by the Defaulting Defendants and/or the domain name\nregistrar of \u201cany and all rights to any domain name(s) that any of the enjoined persons possesses\nor controls, where the domain name contains the word \u2018EDEN\u2019 (including but not limited to\nedensalt.com).\u201d (D.I. 30-1 at ]6) Plaintiffs request is made pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1125(d)(1)(C), which authorizes the court to \u201corder the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain\nname or the transfer of the domain name to the owner of the mark.\u201d But \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(C)\nprovides relief for violations of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\u201cACPA\u201d),\n\nwhich specifically addresses trademark violations in the registration, trafficking, or use of a\ndomain name. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d); see Pa. Business Bank v. Biz Bank Corp., 330 F. Supp. 2d\n511 (ED. Pa. 2004) (analyzing trademark infringement under \u00a7 1114 and cybersquatting under \u00a7\n1125(d) as separate causes of action). Because Plaintiff's complaint does not allege a cause of\naction under the ACPA, Plaintiff has failed to make the requisite showing of liability to support\nthe remedy of a domain name transfer under \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(C). Cf Ownum, LLC v. Ownum, Inc.,\nC.A. No. 19-1043-MN-JLH, 2020 WL 8882941, at *1, 4 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2020) (granting\ntransfer of a domain name to the plaintiff on a motion for default judgment where the case\n\u201cinvolve[d] an alleged violation of the [ACPA].\u201d).\n\nI recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs requested relief at paragraph 8 of the\nproposed order, which seeks to enjoin the Defaulting Defendants \u201cfrom filing any trademark\napplication seeking to register any trademark that incorporates \u2018EDEN\u2019 or any other word\nconfusingly similar thereto, and that Earl George and Eden Import & Export LLC must withdraw\nany such pending applications.\u201d (D.J. 30-1 at \u00a78) The record shows that the Defaulting\nDefendants already filed a trademark application which was denied due to a likelihood of\nconfusion with Plaintiff's mark. (D.I. 35) Plaintiff has failed to provide any authority\nsupporting this request, and the court finds no basis to grant the request.\n\nFinally, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiff's requested relief at paragraph 9 of the\nproposed order, which seeks to compel the Defaulting Defendants to \u201cdeliver up for destruction\nor other disposition by Plaintiff, all EDEN SALT products as well as any advertisements,\nbrochures, labels, product packaging, signs, prints, decals, business cards, order forms, stickers,\ntags, promotional materials, and other items in their possession, custody or control on which the\nEDEN mark appears (alone or in combination with other terms)[.]\u201d (D.I. 30-1 at ]9) Plaintiff\n\ncites 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1118 in support of this request, which provides that the decision whether to\n\n10\nenter a destruction order is left to the court's discretion. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1118 (providing that\n\u201cthe court may order that all labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles, and\nadvertisements\u201d to be delivered up and destroyed); Daimler AG v. A-Z Wheels LLC, 498 F. Supp.\n3d 1282 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (\u201cUnder 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1118, the decision whether to enter a destruction\norder is left to the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d). Having recommended a permanent injunction against\nfurther infringement under the Lanham Act, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiff's request\nfor an order requiring the destruction of any infringing articles as unnecessary. See Kelley Blue\nBook v. Car-Smarts, Inc., 802 F. Supp. 278, 293 (C.D. Cal. 1992) (\u201c[W]here an injunction is\nissued under the Lanham Act enjoining an infringer from further infringement, the rights of the\nplaintiff are adequately protected and an order requiring destruction of infringing articles, though\npermitted, may be unnecessary.\u201d).\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiff's motion for\nentry of default judgment under Rule 55(b)(2), enter judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 58, and issue a permanent injunction in the following form:\n\nIT IS ORDERED that the Defaulting Defendants shall cease and desist\nfrom any and all infringement of Plaintiff's rights in its registered marks which\nare identified in the motion for default judgment.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the Defaulting Defendants is\n\nenjoined from any use of \u201cEDEN\u201d (alone or in combination with other terms,\n\nincluding but not limited to \u201cEDEN SALT\u201d) or any words confusingly similar\n\nthereto, as a trademark, trade name, corporate name, domain name, social media\n\npresence, or other commercial indication of origin, or that incorporates EDEN in\n\n11\nconnection with the advertising, display, sale, offering for sale or distribution of\n\nany products in any medium, whether through wholesale, retail or online channels\n\n(including but not limited to sales on the Internet, through Amazon, through any\n\nAmazon storefront or via any other online presence).\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the Defaulting Defendants is\n\nenjoined from operating the edensalt.com website.\n\nPlaintiff shall serve a copy of this Report and Recommendation on the Defaulting\nDefendants and shall file proof of such service with the court once service is complete.\n\nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections\nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to three (3)\npages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right\nto de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage y. Barnhart, 171 F. App\u2019x 924, 925 n.1\n(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe parties are directed to the court\u2019s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court\u2019s website,\n\nhttp://www.ded.uscourts.gov.\n\nDated: April 13, 2023 \\.\\ \u2018Ig\n\n\\ MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n\n"}]
