FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE 
INTERNATIONAL CONSTRUCTION 
PRODUCTS, LLC, 
Plaintiff, 
V. 
CATERPILLAR, INC., et al., 
Defendants. Civil Action No. 15-108-RGA 
MEMORANDUM ORDER 
Defendant Caterpillar has moved for certification of interlocutory appeal of my denial of 
its summary judgment motion. (D.I. 463). The motion has been fully briefed. (D.I. 465,468, 
471). 
The parties agree upon the standard for such a certification. I would need to certify that 
the appeal involves a controlling question of law upon which there is substantial ground for 
difference of opinion, the resolution of which would materially advance the ultimate termination 
of the litigation. (D.I. 465 at 8; D.I. 468 at 3). Caterpillar says that there are ""at least"" five such 
controlling questions of law. (D.I. 465 at 10). 
I think Caterpillar is wrong. It does not cite any cases that are contrary to any of the 
cases I cited in my summary judgment opinion. Indeed, for most of the issues it raises, it is clear 
that it does not disagree on the law. It merely disagrees with my application of that law to the 
Page 1 of 3 facts of record in this case. It essentially wants a do over with the Court of Appeals on the 
application of established law to an extensive factual record. 
Caterpillar's first argument is that I impermissibly allowed late amendment of the 
pleadings . That is not a ""controlling question of law."" Amendment of pleadings is a 
discretionary decision. 
Caterpillar 's second argument, which is not addressed in the summary judgment opinion, 
is that Caterpillar is too remote to be a defendant when ICP is the plaintiff. ICP is an ""indirect 
purchaser,"" not a ""direct purchaser."" The argument relates to ""the risk of duplicative recovery 
and the potential for overly-complex damages and apportionment calculations ."" McCarthy v. 
Recordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 851 n.14 (3d Cir. 1996). Caterpillar did not address either the 
risk of duplicative recoveries1 or the potential for problems related to damages in its summary 
judgment briefing. (D.I. 391 at 34-35; D.I. 433 at 6-7). It does not hint at any such argument in 
the instant briefing either. 
Caterpillar's third argument is that I ruled incorrectly on its collateral estoppel argument. 
I put it like this because Caterpillar and I agree that the same Third Circuit case states the law. 
(D.I. 456 at 23; D.I. 465 at 13). There is no dispute about a controlling question of law.2 
Caterpillar's fourth argument is, essentially, that the great weight of the evidence is on its 
side. That could be true, but that is not the standard that applies when considering summary 
judgment. Caterpillar characterizes Plaintiffs evidence as ""speculation."" (D.I. 465 at 15). 
Caterpillar simply disagrees with my analysis of the record. 
1 I cannot see how there would be any risk at all. 
2 Although not germane to this Memorandum Order, I note that the related case in Florida was 
argued to the Eleventh Circuit on December 13, 2022. 
Page 2 of 3 Caterpillar's fifth argument is that the evidence for the tortious interference claim is 
insufficient. I do not think there is any disagreement on the applicable law. Rather, the 
disagreement is on whether the record provides a basis for Plaintiff to move forward on this 
claim. That is not a controlling question of law. 
Caterpillar's motion (D.I. 463) is DENIED.

MEMORANDUM

I. INTRODUCTION

Petitioner is an inmate at the Sussex Correctional Institution in Georgetown,
Delaware. He has filed a form application for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. §
2241 (D.I. 1 at 1-8), a typed document titled “Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus”
(“Petition”) (D.I. 1 at 9-17), and a document titled “Points and Authorities in
Support of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus” (“Petition”). (D.I. 1-1) In the
form application, Petitioner explains that he

was arrested on April 20, 2015 on assorted charges which

included guns and drugs to which he had in his private
vehicle while traveling on Interstate 95 through
Wilmington, Delaware. On 6-22-15, a True Bill of
Indictment was handed down for Eric. B. Simmons with
firearms, drug, and traffic charges pursuant to Delaware
Uniform Controlled Substances Act under Title 16 of the
Delaware Code; the National Firearms Act under
Delaware Code Title 11; and Traffic charges on Delaware
Uniform Traffic Complaint and Summons under Delaware
Title 21.
(DI. 1 at 9-10) Petitioner explains that, following a Superior Court jury trial on
May 10, 2017, the Superior Court sentenced him to ten years at Level V
incarceration. (D.I. 1 at 10) It appears that Petitioner will be transferred to Iowa at
the completion of his Delaware sentence. See Simmons v. Akinbayo, 2018 WL
3827149 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 6, 2018).

Petitioner asserts that he “is a private sentient man, a living being with a
soul, flesh, and blood, and not a ‘subject’ or ‘citizen’ of the U.S. government or
Delaware state government.” (D.I. 1 at 9) He contends that he is in custody in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the State of Delaware lacked
jurisdiction over his person. (See id.) Petitioner seeks immediate release from
custody, and explains that he has filed the instant habeas request under 28 U.S.C. §
2241 rather than 28 U.S.C. § 2254 because

§ 2254 requires a state habeas petitioner to be in custody
pursuant to the judgment of a state court[. This]
description [...] does not fit Petitioner’s circumstances
because the judgment is a nullity, a void judgment.”!

(DI. 1-1 at 1-2)
I. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground
that his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Notably,
a district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition “if it plainly appears from
the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not
entitled to relief.” Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. § 2254.
I. DISCUSSION
Petitioner invokes the so-called “flesh and blood” movement to avoid the
consequences of his state criminal convictions. As explained in a recent decision
by the Western District of Pennsylvania,
[a]dherents to the “flesh and blood” movement believe
that a person has two distinct versions of himself, a “flesh-

and-blood” natural man and a legal person—the vessel
[also called a “strawman”]. They theorize that the

'Petitioner’s justification for filing his petition under § 2241 lacks merit, because §
2254 is the exclusive federal remedy when a petitioner challenges the validity of a
state criminal conviction and sentence. Nevertheless, since Petitioner’s instant
habeas request is summarily dismissible regardless of the authority relied upon, the
Court will not address this error in more depth.

3
government has power only over the strawman and not

over the live person, who remains free. Therefore, the real

person can demand that government officials pay

enormous sums of money to use the strawman's name or,

in the case of prisoners, to keep him in custody. Courts

have routinely dismissed nonsensical claims of this nature

as patently frivolous.
Ellis v. Philadelphia Cnty., 2022 WL 1491411, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 28, 2022)
(collecting cases) (cleaned up).

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Petitioner’s instant “flesh and
blood” argument is frivolous and fails to provide a basis for habeas relief.
Therefore, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant Petition for failing to assert
an issue cognizable on federal habeas review.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant
Petition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because
Petitioner has failed to make a “substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United

States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.

MEMORANDUM OPINION

Presently before the court in this civil action alleging violations of federal securities laws
and Delaware law, is plaintiff Morgan C. Huntley’s (“Plaintiff”) unopposed motion for leave to
amend the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). (D.I. 40) For the
following reasons, Plaintiffs motion to amend is GRANTED.!
I. BACKGROUND

Plaintiff filed this action against defendants VBit Technologies Corp., VBit Mining LLC,
Advanced Mining Group, Danh Cong Vo a/k/a Don Vo, Katie Vo, Sean Tu, Jin Gao, Lillian
Zhao, and various John Doe individual defendants and ABC companies (“Defendants”) on
September 2, 2022, alleging violations of various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Securities Act”) and asserting causes of action for common law fraud, breach of

contract, and unjust enrichment under Delaware law. (D.I. 1) Five named Defendants answered

| Filings associated with the pending motion are found at D.I. 42, D.I. 44, DI. 45, D.L. 46, and
DI. 47.
the complaint. (D.I. 9; D.I. 11; D.I. 18) Defendants Lillian Zhao and Advanced Mining Group
did not respond to the complaint.? Defendant Jin Gao filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for
improper venue pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3), and Plaintiff subsequently
filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of Jin Gao, resulting in termination of the motion to dismiss.
MI. 22; D.I. 31)

Plaintiff filed the pending motion for leave to amend on March 6, 2023, seeking to add
thirty-five plaintiffs, remove existing defendant Katie Vo from the lawsuit, and add corporate
affiliate VBit DC Corp. as a defendant. (D.I. 40, Ex. B) The proposed amended complaint also
raises additional factual allegations and includes six additional causes of action against
Defendants. (/d.) The additional counts include causes of action for negligent
misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, violations of the Delaware Uniform Deceptive Trade
Practices Act and Consumer Fraud Act, violations of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices
and Consumer Protection Law, appointment of a receiver, and successor liability / de facto
merger or consolidation. (/d., Ex. B at {J 170-78, 191-219) Plaintiff alleges that these factual
allegations were recently discovered as a result of further engagement by Plaintiff's counsel with
victims of Defendants’ conduct and additional due diligence and factual research performed by
Plaintiff's counsel. (D.I. 40 at 3)

II. LEGAL STANDARD

Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that after a responsive

pleading has been filed, a party may amend its pleading “only with the opposing party’s written

consent or the court’s leave,” and “[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.”

2 In the pending motion, Plaintiff indicates he “has not yet determined whether Defendants
Lillian Zhou and Advanced Mining Group exist[.]” (D.L 40 at 2)

2
Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies within the discretion
of the court. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs.
Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to
the amendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Arco, 921 F.2d 484, 487 (3d Cir. 1990). In the absence
of undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the amendment
should be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non-moving party. See
Foman, 371 U.S. at 182; In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1434.

I. DISCUSSION

Plaintiff's motion to amend is granted. There is no undue delay because Plaintiff sought
leave to amend only six months after the original complaint was filed, before a scheduling order
was entered. (D.I. 1; D.I. 40) Plaintiff explains that the proposed amendment could not be made
sooner because the additional factual allegations and causes of action are based on information
obtained from the proposed additional plaintiffs. (D.I. 40 at 3)

Moreover, no Defendant has indicated that Plaintiffs proposed amended pleading would
be futile or would result in undue prejudice. (D.I. 42; D.I. 45; D.I. 46; D.I. 47) Defendants
answered the original complaint in lieu of moving to dismiss, and they raise no opposition to the
newly added counts in the proposed amended complaint. (D.I. 9; D.I. 11; D.I. 18)

Consequently, there is no basis on the present record to deny Plaintiff's motion to amend under
Rule 15(a). See Tri-State Energy Sols., LLP v. KVAR Energy Savings, Inc., C.A. No. 08-209-SD,
2010 WL 11707411, at *2 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2010) (granting unopposed motion to join additional
parties and add certain counts to the complaint).

The proposed amended complaint removes Katie Vo as a defendant. (D.I. 40, Ex. B) In

his reply letter, Plaintiff confirms that the omission of Katie Vo from the proposed amended
pleading was intentional. (D.I. 44 at § 6) Having granted Plaintiff's motion to amend the
complaint, I recommend that the court dismiss defendant Katie Vo from the action without
prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2).
IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is GRANTED in the
form attached as Exhibit A to the pending motion.? (D.I. 40) The proposed amended complaint
attached to the motion to amend shall be docketed by the clerk as the amended pleading. In
accordance with the amended complaint and the parties’ agreement, I recommend that the court
dismiss defendant Katie Vo from the action without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 41(a)(2). (D.I. 44; D.I. 40, Ex. A) The remaining Defendants who have entered an
appearance in this action shall have thirty (30) days to file a response to the amended complaint.
An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.
This Memorandum Opinion is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), Fed. R. Civ. P.
72(a), and D. Del. LR 72.1(a)(2). The parties may serve and file specific written objections
within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Memorandum Opinion. Fed. R.
Civ. P. 72(a). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to three (3) pages each.
The parties are directed to the court’s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.

MEMORANDUM OPINION!

Plaintiff Candice Lynn Shaffer (“Plaintiff”) filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §
405(g) against the defendant Kilolo Kijakazi, the Acting Commissioner of the Social Security
Administration (the “Commissioner”). (D.I. 1) Pending before the court are two motions: (1)
Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeking judicial review of the Commissioner’s final
decision denying Plaintiff's claim for disability insurance benefits (“DIB”) under Title II of the
Social Security Act (the “Act”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 401-433, (D.I. 11); and (2) the Commissioner’s
motion for remand to the Social Security Administration for further proceedings pursuant to the
fourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), (D.I. 13).? Plaintiff opposes the Commissioner’s motion
for remand for further proceedings and argues that the court should instead remand the case for a
finding of disability and an award of benefits. (D.I. 15) For the reasons set forth below, the

Commissioner’s motion for remand is DENIED, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is

' On August 2, 2022, the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned judicial officer
to conduct all proceedings in this matter through final judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).

(DI. 10)
2 The briefing on the pending motion for remand is found at D.I. 14 and D.I. 15.
GRANTED insofar as Plaintiff seeks the entry of judgment under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) reversing
the Commissioner’s final decision and ordering the payment of benefits.
L BACKGROUND

Plaintiff filed an application for DIB on April 30, 2014, alleging disability as of February
4, 2010. (D.I. 8 at21) An ALJ held a hearing on April 25, 2017, and subsequently issued an
unfavorable decision on June 22, 2017, finding that Plaintiff could perform a reduced range of
light work even though she had severe impairments which included degenerative disc disease of
the lumbar spine, degenerative joint disease, obesity, and thoracic outlet syndrome. (Jd. at 21-
27) After the Appeals Council denied her request for review, Plaintiff appealed the decision to
this court. (Jd. at 10-14)

On August 8, 2019, the court reversed the ALJ’s decision and remanded the case for
further administrative proceedings. (D.I. 8-1 at 590-627) In reaching this conclusion, the court
found that the ALJ erred in his assessment of the medical opinion evidence by assigning little
weight to the opinions of three treating physicians: Dr. Tuerff, Dr. Devotta, and Dr. Bose. (/d. at
620-25) The court determined that the treatment records the ALJ relied on to discount those
opinions were not inconsistent with the medical opinions. (/d.) Because the treating physician
opinions established greater limitations than those set forth in the ALJ’s residual functional
capacity (“RFC”) determination, the court rejected that determination. (Jd. at 626) The court
further found that the ALJ erred in his finding that Plaintiff could perform light work based on
the opinions of the state agency consultants because those consultants opined that Plaintiff could
perform sedentary work. (Jd. at 625)

On remand, another hearing was held and the ALJ again issued an unfavorable decision

in April of 2020 based on a finding that Plaintiff could perform a reduced range of sedentary
work. (D.I. 8-1 at 457-71) After the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review,
Plaintiff again appealed the decision to this court. The Commissioner filed an uncontested
motion to remand the case for further consideration of the medical opinion evidence and
Plaintiff's RFC, and to obtain supplemental testimony from a vocational expert. (D.L. 8-2 at 32-
33) The court granted the uncontested motion to remand on March 18, 2021. (Jd. at 28)

On August 15, 2021, the Appeals Council entered an order effectuating the remand,
concluding that the ALJ had not complied with the court’s 2019 order and setting forth specific
instructions requiring the ALJ to further consider the medical opinion evidence, Plaintiff's RFC,
and supplemental vocational evidence. (D.I. 8-2 at 40-42) The ALJ held a hearing in January of
2022 and denied Plaintiff's claim yet again in March of 2022, finding that Plaintiff could
perform a reduced range of sedentary work at step 5 of the sequential analysis. (D.I. 8-1 at 1002-
13)

For the third time, Plaintiff has appealed the ALJ’s decision. (D.I. 1) For the second
time, the Commissioner has responded to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with a
motion for remand, conceding that the ALJ erred in considering Plaintiff's claim. (D.I. 14) The
court must now decide whether to remand for further administrative proceedings pursuant to the
fourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), or whether a finding of disability and an order for
payment of benefits is appropriate at this juncture.

Il. STANDARD OF REVIEW

Section 405(g) defines the role of the court in reviewing Social Security disability
determinations, providing that “[t]he court shall have the power to enter, upon the pleadings and
transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the

Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.” 42
U.S.C. § 405(g). “Oftentimes the remedy prescribed by the court is the relief sought . . . by the
Commissioner: a remand for further proceedings. Such relief is specifically authorized by
statute, and given the deference owed to administrative agency decisions, is often appropriate.”
Diaz v. Berryhill, 388 F. Supp. 3d 382, 390 (M.D. Pa. 2019). But the statute also provides that
the court may direct the Commissioner to award benefits instead of remanding for further
proceedings. See Brownawell v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. , 554 F.3d 352, 357-58 (3d Cir. 2008).

A decision regarding the proper form of relief under § 405(g) is within the discretion of
the court. See Podedworny v. Harris, 745 F.2d 210, 221 (3d Cir. 1984). An order directing the
agency to award benefits is appropriate only if two conditions are met: (1) “there has been an
excessive delay in the litigation of the claim which is not attributable to the claimant;” and (2)
“the administrative record of the case has been fully developed and substantial evidence on the
record as a whole indicates that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits.” Diaz, 388 F.
Supp. 3d at 391. If both conditions are met, “it is unreasonable for a court to give the ALJ
another opportunity to consider new evidence concerning the disability because the
administrative proceeding would result only in further delay in the receipt of benefits.”
Podedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22.

Under the first prong of the analysis, “courts measure th[e] delay both in terms of the
passage of years and by reference to whether there have been prior appeals and remands.” Diaz,
388 F. Supp. 3d at 391. Generally, courts have found that administrative delays of five years or
more in cases involving one or two prior remands constitute excessive delays warranting an
award of benefits. See id. (citing Brownawell, 554 F.3d at 358 (awarding benefits in case

involving eight-year delay and two prior remands); Morales v. Apfel, 225 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir.
2000) (awarding benefits in case involving ten-year delay and two appeals); Podedworny, 745
F.2d at 223 (awarding benefits after more than five years of proceedings and two appeals)).

The second prong is satisfied when the record is fully developed and substantial evidence
on the record supports a conclusion that the claimant is disabled and entitled to benefits. Diaz,
388 F. Supp. 3d at 391-92 (citing Gilliland v. Heckler, 786 F.2d 178, 184 (3d Cir. 1986)). In
circumstances where “the record before the agency does not support the agency action, [ ] the
agency has not considered all relevant factors, or [ ] the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate
the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare
circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.” Fla.
Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). However, an award of benefits is
proper when an “extensive medical record, wrongly rejected by the ALJ, is substantial evidence”
that a claimant is disabled, Morales, 225 F.3d at 320, or when treatment records and medical
opinions over an extended period support a conclusion that the claimant cannot maintain a
normal, regular work schedule, Nance v. Barnhart, 194 F. Supp. 2d 302, 322 (D. Del. 2002).

Il. DISCUSSION

A. Delay

The parties do not meaningfully dispute Plaintiff's satisfaction of the first condition
regarding excessive delay which is not attributable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff's disability application
was filed more than eight years ago and was subject to three hearings before an ALJ and three
appeals to the district court. (D.I. 8 at 21-27; D.I. 8-1 at 457-71, 590-627, 1002-13; D.L. 8-2 at
40-42; D.I. 14) The delays are therefore excessive both in terms of the overall duration and the
number of instances in which the court has been charged with remanding flawed ALJ decisions.

See Diaz, 388 F. Supp. 3d at 393 (“[I]f we acceded to the Commissioner’s suggestion and
remanded this case we would be setting the stage for an extraordinary, fourth administrative
decision in this case.”). The delays in this case are more pronounced than those deemed
excessive by the Third Circuit in Brownawell and Podedworny. See Brownawell, 554 F.3d at
358 (awarding benefits in case involving eight-year delay and two prior remands); Podedworny,
745 F.2d at 223 (awarding benefits after more than five years of proceedings and two appeals).
Therefore, the first condition supports a finding of disability and an award of benefits.

B. Development of the Administrative Record

The court must next determine whether substantial evidence dictates a finding that the
claimant is disabled.? See Podedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22. In performing this analysis, the
court is mindful of the Commissioner’s admonition that “the district courts have no fact-finding
role in Social Security cases.” Grant v. Shalala, 989 F.2d 1332, 1338 (3d Cir. 1993).
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has affirmed the court’s “broad grant of authority” under §
405(g) to enter a judgment reversing the Commissioner’s decision without remanding the case
for arehearing. Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1765, 1779 (2019).

The Commissioner contends that remand for further proceedings is appropriate because
the ALJ’s articulation of the medical opinion evidence is unclear and does not permit meaningful
judicial review, and the record contains competing medical opinion evidence. (D.I. 14 at 2-3)
But, as in Podedworny, correction of certain defects in the ALJ’s assessment of the medical
opinion evidence is not enough in this case. 745 F.2d at 222. Instead, the record before the court
establishes that the Commissioner’s presentation of medical and vocational evidence is not

sufficient to support a finding that Plaintiff is not disabled. Id.

3 The parties do not appear to dispute the completeness of the administrative record. See
Podedworny, 745 F.2d at 221-22.
Substantial evidence in the record before the court supports a conclusion that Plaintiff
cannot perform sedentary work. Plaintiff seeks benefits for the time between her alleged
disability onset date on February 4, 2010, and her date last insured, which was December 31,
2014. (D.L. 8 at 21) The evidence of record, including most of the opinions by Plaintiff's
treating specialists which have been the focal point of multiple remands, falls within this time
period. Because this evidence has been fully developed and will not change, the court concludes
that a fourth attempt by the ALJ to assess the evidence is not a worthwhile use of resources. See
Podedworny, 745 F.2d at 222.

Plaintiff's medical treatment notes from February 4, 2010 through December 31, 2014
support a conclusion that Plaintiff is disabled and entitled to benefits. Plaintiff underwent a first
rib resection, scalenectomy, and neurolysis to treat her thoracic outlet syndrome in February of
2010. (D.L. 8-1 at 256-58) Although the surgery eliminated her back and upper chest pain, she
experienced pain, tingling, and numbness from her shoulder to her hand. (Jd.) Her surgeon
confirmed in follow up treatment notes that Plaintiff would be unable to return to work due to
her continuing post-operative neurologic symptoms in her left arm, as well as her inability to use
her right arm. (Jd. at 260-62) On physical examination for her neck and shoulder pain in July of
2010, Plaintiff showed significant weakness in her rhomboid strength of the left shoulder, and
the range of motion in her neck was impaired to about 60%. (Jd. at 863-65) Trigger point
injections were not successful in reducing her pain. (/d. at 866)

Plaintiff also received a series of lumbar epidural injections in 2012 to treat back pain
which radiated down her right leg, but she continued to experience low back and mid thoracic
pain. (/d. at 119-20) She underwent a provocative lumbar discography on December 10, 2012,

which revealed a grade IV tear at the L3 and L4 spinal segments, followed by a lumbar fusion
procedure on April 23, 2013. (/d. at 121-25) Her pain levels in the months following surgery
were between six and eight on a scale of ten, and she continued to experience lower back pain
radiating across her lower limbs. (Jd. at 125-27) Physical therapy notes after her lumbar surgery
indicate that she could walk for an hour and sit for thirty minutes at a time. (D.I. 8 at 589)
Plaintiff also received injections in her sacroiliac joint in November of 2013, but the injections
provided no relief. (D.I. 8-1 at 130-31) An MRI in April of 2014 revealed postoperative fibrosis
and narrowing at the L3 and L4 discs. (D.I. 8 at 797)

Plaintiff also sought treatment for knee and hip pain beginning in 2010. Treatment notes
from orthopedist Bruce Katz, M.D., confirm that Plaintiff received injections in both knees in
November of 2010 and discussed distal realignment surgery. (D.I. 8 at 356) Plaintiff also saw
orthopedist Alex Bodenstab, M.D. for treatment of her right hip and groin pain. (/d. at 360) Dr.
Bodenstab described her symptoms as “fairly dramatic” and recommended a hip arthroscopy.
(Id.) On May 31, 2011, Dr. Bodenstab performed a right hip arthroscopic resection of a torn
labrum. (Jd. at 364-65) Following the surgery, Plaintiff continued to report pain and groin
cramping, although she demonstrated increased tolerance for walking. (Jd. at 366-67) In July of
2011, Dr. Bodenstab described Plaintiffs hip issues as “the least of her issues right now” and
noted that she was under consideration for a patellar realignment to treat damage to the cartilage
in her knee. (/d. at 369) Physical therapy notes from 2014 confirm that Plaintiff continued to
experience groin pain at a level that prevented her physical therapist from initiating strength
training. (D.I. 8-1 at 20) Her pain was exacerbated by lifting, pushing, and pulling. (/d.)

On October 27, 2011, Plaintiff underwent surgery to treat her moderate to severe plantar

fasciitis and a moderate heel spur which demonstrated bone marrow edema. (D.I. 8-1 at 375,
387-88) Despite initial improvement post-surgery, Plaintiff's pain returned throughout her entire
foot, limiting her to walking no more than one hour per day with pain. (/d. at 398, 416-17)

The treating specialists who performed Plaintiff's surgeries and treated her pain provided
medical opinions that uniformly described severe, work-preclusive limitations. See SSR 96-8p,
1996 WL 374184, at *1 (July 2, 1996) (explaining that an individual’s ability to do sustained
work-related activities on a “regular and continuing basis” means 8 hours a day, for 5 days a
week). Dr. Devotta, a pain management specialist, opined in May of 2014 that Plaintiff could
stand or walk no more than two hours and sit no more than four hours in an eight-hour workday,
with one or two unscheduled breaks lasting fifteen to twenty minutes and two or three absences
per month. (D.I. 8 at 823) Dr. Devotta issued another opinion on June 10, 2015, a few months
after Plaintiff's date last insured. (D.I. 8-1 at 845-48) In this assessment, Dr. Devotta reiterated
that Plaintiff could stand or walk less than two hours less than two hours in an eight-hour
workday and could remain at a workstation for two to three hours total in a standard workday,
with one or two unscheduled breaks per day and three absences per month due to her pain and
other symptoms. (Jd.)

Dr. Bose, Plaintiff's orthopedic surgeon, similarly opined in March of 2014 that Plaintiff
could sit for two hours in an eight-hour workday and stand, walk, and drive for one hour each in
an eight-hour workday. (D.L. 8 at 818) In a 2017 opinion, Dr. Bose maintained his opinion that
Plaintiff had a maximum tolerance of sitting for two hours and standing, walking, or driving for
one hour in an eight-hour workday. (D.I. 8-1 at 448) And Dr. Tuerff, a vascular surgeon, opined
in October of 2010 that Plaintiff would need to lie down for about two hours per workday and
take four to five unscheduled breaks. (Id. at 312-14) These limitations are work preclusive

according to the vocational expert, who testified that frequent unscheduled breaks and more than
one absence a month would not be tolerated in an employment setting. (D.I. 8-1 at 523, 1065)
Taking into consideration the vocational expert’s testimony, as well as Plaintiff's medical
opinions and treatment records, there is substantial evidence to support Plaintiff's inability to
work full-time.

The ALJ’s failure to articulate a sufficient basis for rejecting the medical opinions of
Plaintiffs treating physicians, despite multiple remands with explicit instructions on how to
remedy the deficiencies, further supports an award of benefits at this stage. See Pearson v. Saul,
2020 WL 1865715, at *13 (MLD. Pa. Apr. 14, 2020). The court’s prior remands in this case have
largely been based on errors in the ALJ’s assessment of opinions from Plaintiff's treating
physicians, Drs. Tuerff, Devotta, and Bose, which in turn impact the adequacy of the RFC
assessment. (D.I. 8-1 at 620-25); see Zirnsak v. Colvin, 777 F.3d 607, 614 (3d Cir. 2014)
(explaining that hypothetical posed to vocational expert must accurately portray credibly
established limitations). In 2019, the court determined that the medical opinions of Drs. Devotta
and Bose describing Plaintiff's significant functional limitations were supported by objective
medical evidence, and the ALJ had not adequately discussed the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §
404.1527(c) in connection with the medical opinions of Drs. Tuerff, Devotta, and Bose. (D.I. 8-
1 at 620-25)

The ALJ has admittedly not been able to remedy these deficiencies in the 2020 and 2022
opinions. (D.I. 8-1 at 468-69, 1010-11; D.I. 8-2 at 32-33; D.I. 14) In 2021, the Commissioner
conceded that another remand for further consideration of the opinion evidence and Plaintiff's
RFC was appropriate, and the Appeals Council set forth specific instructions requiring the ALJ
to further consider the medical opinion evidence, Plaintiff's RFC, and supplemental vocational

evidence. (D.I. 8-2 at 32-33, 40-42) Nonetheless, the Commissioner now admits that the ALJ’s

10
March 2022 decision was again deficient in the assessment of the treating physician opinions.
(D.I. 14) In that decision, the ALJ afforded no weight to the opinions of Dr. Bose, Dr. Tuerff, or
Dr. Devotta because the restrictive postural limitations set forth in those opinions were
inconsistent with the overall record—essentially the same conclusion that was rejected by the
court in the first appeal back in 2019. (D.I. 8-1 at 1010-1 1)

The Commissioner argues that remand for further proceedings is appropriate because the
record contains competing opinion evidence from a state agency medical expert who challenged
the extent of the limitations imposed by Plaintiff's treating physicians and opined Plaintiff could
stand or walk for four hours and sit for six hours in a normal workday. (D.I. 14 at 3; D.I. 8 at 91)
But the court’s 2019 decision explained that the opinions of Drs. Bose and Devotta were
consistent with objective medical evidence in the record and noted that the opinions of state
agency consultants contradicting the treating physicians’ opinions could not properly be credited
in the absence of an adequate explanation of the ALJ’s reasons for doing so. (D.I. 8-1 at 622-
25); See Fargnoli v. Massanari, 247 F.3d 34, 43 (3d Cir. 2001). The ALJ was given two more
opportunities to provide such an explanation, and it is undisputed that the ALJ failed to do so on
both occasions. (D.I. 8-1 at 468-69, 1010-11; D.I. 8-2 at 32-33; D.I. 14) This supports a
conclusion that there is no sufficient basis in the overall record to reject the limitations
consistently articulated in the treating physicians’ opinions. After three decisions by the ALJ
and two failed attempts to repair the record, “it is unreasonable . . . to give the ALJ another
opportunity to consider new evidence concerning the disability because the administrative
proceeding would result only in further delay to the receipt of benefits.” Podedworny, 745 F.2d

at 222; see also Smith, 139 S. Ct. at 1779.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner’s motion for remand is DENIED (D.I. 13),
and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED insofar as it seeks judgment under
42 U.S.C. § 405(g) reversing the Commissioner’s final decision and ordering the payment of

benefits. An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue.

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

STATE OF DELAWARE,

MEMORANDUM

I. BACKGROUND

In February 2001, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner
Corey D. Washington (“Petitioner”) of one count of possession of cocaine with
intent to deliver, one count of maintaining a vehicle, two counts of possession of
cocaine within 1000 feet of a school, one court of resisting arrest, one count of
driving with a suspended or revoked license, and one count of possession of drug
paraphernalia. See Washington v. State, 284 A.3d 725 (Table), 2022 WL 4242151,
at *1 (Del. Sept. 14, 2022). The Superior Court sentenced Petitioner as a habitual

offender to life imprisonment plus nine years. See Washington, 2022 WL
4242151, at *1. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner’s convictions
and sentence on March 18, 2002. See Washington v. State, 793 A.2d 311 (Table),
2002 WL 440253, at *1 (Del. Mar. 18, 2002).

Thereafter, Petitioner filed two motions for postconviction relief pursuant to
Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 (“Rule 61 motions”) — one in 2003 and
one in 2005 — which were denied. See Washington v. State, 940 A.2d 946 (Table),
2007 WL 4110636, at *1 (Del. Nov. 20, 2007). Petitioner only appealed the denial
of his second Rule 61 motion, and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed that
denial on November 20, 2007. See id. at *2.

In October 2017, the Superior Court granted Petitioner’s request for a
certificate of eligibility to file a petition to modify Petitioner’s habitual offender
sentence under 11 Del. C. § 4214(f). See Washington, 2022 WL 4242151, at *1.
The Superior Court granted the petition on December 11, 2018, and reduced
Petitioner’s life sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver to thirty-
five years of Level V incarceration, suspended after fifteen years for decreasing
levels of supervision. See id. The remainder of Petitioner’s sentence was
unchanged. Jd.

On May 4, 2022, Petitioner filed a Rule 35 motion for correction of an

illegal sentence. See Washington, 2022 WL 4242151, at *1. The Superior Court

2
denied the Rule 35 motion on May 11, 2022 for being repetitive and because the
sentence was appropriate for the reasons set forth at sentencing. See id. The
Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court’s judgment on September
14, 2022. See id. at *2.

In October 2022, Petitioner filed the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (“Petition”) presently pending before the Court.
(D.I. 1) Petitioner contends that the Delaware state courts violated his Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to retroactively apply Delaware’s 2011
Ned Carpenter Act! to his case when denying his Rule 35 motion to modify his
sentence. According to Petitioner, his sentences for possession of cocaine with
intent to deliver (thirty-five years of Level V incarceration suspended after fifteen
years) and two counts of possession within 1000 feet of a school (two years of
Level V incarceration for each count) are illegal because the Ned Carpenter Act

eliminated or modified those offenses in 2011. (D.I. 1 at 9; D.I. 1-1 at 26)

‘Delaware enacted the Ned Carpenter Act in 2011. See Ayala v. State, 204 A.3d
829, 838 (Del. 2019). “The Act eliminated the offenses of possession near a park
and maintaining a dwelling but did not apply retroactively to any violation that
occurred prior to September 1, 2011.” Jd. at 838-39.
0. STANDARD OF REVIEW

A district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground
that his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). It is well-
settled that “[s]tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law,”? and claims
based on errors of state law are not cognizable on habeas review. See Estelle, 502
USS. at 67-68. Notably, a district court may summarily dismiss a habeas petition
“if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it
that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.” Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. § 2254.
Ii. DISCUSSION

Although presented in terms of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,
Petitioner’s challenge to the Delaware state courts’ denial of his Rule 35 motion
for correction of sentence alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal
habeas relief because Petitioner’s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware state
courts’ analysis and application of a state law in a state collateral proceeding. See
Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 1998) (holding that the “federal

role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what

2Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).
4
occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner’s
conviction; what occurred in the petitioner’s collateral proceeding does not enter
into the habeas proceeding.”) (emphasis in original); see also Lambert v.
Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (“alleged errors in [state] collateral
proceedings . . . are not a proper basis for habeas relief’). Accordingly, the Court
concludes that summary dismissal of the instant Petition is appropriate.
IV. CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss the instant
Petition. The Court will also decline to issue a certificate of appealability because
Petitioner has failed to make a “substantial showing of the denial of a
constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); 3d Cir. L.A.R. 22.2 (2011); United

States v. Eyer, 113 F.3d 470 (3d Cir. 1997). A separate Order follows.

MEMORANDUM 
Petitioner is proceeding prose with a petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 2254 (""Petition""). (D.I. 3) 
In 2005, a Delaware Superior Court jury convicted Petitioner of six counts of first degree 
unlawful sexual intercourse, four counts of second degree unlawful sexual intercourse, and two 
counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child. (D.I. 3-1 at 7); see Clark v. State, 900 A.2d 100 
(Table), 2006 WL 1186738, at* 1 (Del. 2006). The two victims were the seven and nine year old 
sons of Petitioner 's girlfriend at the time. See Clark, 2006 WL 1186738 at *l. On May 23, 
2005, the Superior Court sentenced Petitioner to 102 years of incarceration . The Delaware 
Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner's convictions May 2, 2006. See Clark, 2006 WL 1186738, at 
*2. 
In 2022, Petitioner filed in the Delaware Superior Court a pro se motion for correction of 
sentence pursuant to Delaware Superior Court Criminal Rule 35(a). (D.I. 3 at 4; D.I. 3-1 at 10) 
The Rule 35(a) motion alleged that the ""Superior Court failed to give all but one charge an effective date as to when [Petitioner's] sentences were to begin."" (D.I. 3 at 4) The Superior 
Court denied the Rule 35(a) motion on November 16, 2022, and Petitioner does not indicate ifhe 
appealed that decision. (D.I. 3; D.I. 3-1 at 10) 
On November 30, 2022, Petitioner filed the instant Petition and a Motion for Leave to 
Proceed In Forma Pauperis . (D.I. 1; D.I. 3) The Petition asserts four grounds for relief: (1) trial 
counsel provided ineffective assistance during Petitioner 's 2005 criminal proceeding ; (2) the 
Superior Court did not provide effective dates for the sentences imposed for eleven of his twelve 
2005 convictions; (3) in 2022, the Superior Court violated Delaware state law by denying 
Petitioner's Rule 35(a) motion; and (4) the Superior Court judge who denied Petitioner's rule 
35(a) motion in 2022 acted with a closed mind. (D.I. 3) 
I. GOVERNING LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
The instant Petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 
1996 (""AEDPA""), 28 U.S.C. § 2244. A district court may entertain a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus on behalf of someone in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on 
the ground that his custody violates the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States, 1 and 
may summarily dismiss a habeas petition ""if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and 
any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief."" Rule 4, 28 U.S.C. foll. § 
2254. Notably, claims based on errors of state law are not cognizab le on habeas review. See 
Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684,691 (1975) (noting that ""[s]tate 
courts are the ultimate expositors of state law.""). 
1See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a); Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). 
j 
2 II. DISCUSSION 
A. Claims Three and Four: State Law Issues 
Claims Three and Four challenge the Superior Court's denial of Petitioner's Rule 35 
motion for modification of sentence and, therefore, involve matters of state law. See Lambert v. 
Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210,247 (3d Cir. 2004) (""alleged errors in [state] collateral proceedings ... 
are not a proper basis for habeas relief'); Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 
1998) (holding that the ""federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to 
evaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioner's 
conviction; what occurred in the petitioner's collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas 
proceeding."") (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court will summarily dismiss Claims 
Three and Four for failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. 
B. Claims One and Two: Time-Barred 
In contrast, Claims One and Two assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. 
Nevertheless, as explained below, the Court's preliminary review indicates that Claims One and 
Two are time-barred under AEDPA's one-year statute oflimitations . See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b); 
28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(l) ; United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir. 1999); Mason v. Meyers, 
208 F.3d 414 (3d Cir. 2000). 
AEDP A imposes a one-year filing deadline that runs from the latest of: 
(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion 
of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such 
review; 
(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application 
created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of 
the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from 
filing by such state action; 
(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially 
3 recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly 
recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively 
applicable to cases on collateral review; or 
(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims 
presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due 
diligence. 
28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(l). The Court does not discern any facts triggering the application of§ 
2244(d)(l)(B),(C), or (D). Consequently, the one-year period oflimitations for Claims One and 
Two began to run when Petitioner's convictions became final under§ 2244(d)(l)(A) . 
Pursuant to § 2244( d)(l )(A), if a state prisoner appeals a state court judgment but does 
not seek certiorari review, the judgment of conviction becomes final, and the statute of 
limitations begins to run, upon expiration of the ninety-day time period allowed for seeking 
certiorari review. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 150 (2012). In this case, the Delaware 
Supreme Court affirmed Petitioner 's convictions on May 2, 2006, and it appears that he did not 
seek review by the United States Supreme Court. As a result, his judgment of conviction became 
final on August 1, 2006. Applying the one-year limitations period to that date, Petitioner had 
until August 1, 2007 to timely file a habeas petition. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 662-64 
(3d Cir. 2005) (Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) applies to AEDPA's limitations period); Phlipot v. Johnson, 
2015 WL 1906127, at *3 n. 3 (D. Del. Apr. 27, 2015) (AEDPA's one-year limitations period is 
calculated according to the anniversary method, i.e., the limitations period expires on the 
anniversary of the date it began to run). Petitioner filed the instant Petition on November 30, 
2022, approximately fifteen years after that deadline. Thus, the Court's preliminary screening of 
the Petition indicates that the remaining cognizable habeas claims -Claims One and Two -are 
untimely. 
4 AEDPA's limitations period is subject to statutory and equitable tolling. See Holland, 
560 U.S. at 645 (equitable tolling); 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) (statutory tolling). A petitioner may 
also be excused from failing to comply with the limitations period by making a gateway showing 
of actual innocence. See Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 151 (3d Cir. 2021). Nevertheless, for 
the reasons set forth below, none of these doctrines appear to render Claims One and Two timely 
filed. 
1. Statutory tolling 
Pursuant to § 2244(d)(2), a properly filed state post-conviction motion tolls AEDPA's 
limitations period during the time the motion is pending in the state courts, including any post­
conviction appeals, provided that the motion was filed and pending before the expiration of 
AEDPA's limitations period. See Swartz v. Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 420-24 (3d Cir. 2000). A 
post-conviction motion is '""properly filed' for statutory tolling purposes when its delivery and 
acceptance is in compliance with the state's applicable laws and rules governing filings, such as 
the form of the document , any time limits upon its delivery, the location of the filing, and the 
requisite filing fee."" Crump v. Phelps, 572 F. Sup. 2d 480, 483 (D. Del. 2008). The limitations 
period is also tolled for the time during which an appeal from a post-conviction decision could be 
filed even if the appeal is not eventually filed. See Swartz, 204 F.3d at 424. 
Petitioner filed his Rule 35 motion for correction of sentence in 2022, at least sixteen 
years after the expiration of AEDP A's statute of limitations. Therefore , statutory tolling is 
inapplicable. 
2. Equitable tolling and actual innocence 
Equitable tolling is only appropriate in rare circumstances when the petitioner 
demonstrates ""(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary 
5 circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing."" Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-50. With 
respect to the diligence inquiry, equitable tolling is not available where the late filing is due to 
the petitioner 's excusable neglect. Id. at 651-52. As for the extraordinary circumstance 
requirement, ""the relevant inquiry is not whether the circumstance alleged to be extraordinary is 
unique to the petitioner , but how severe an obstacle it creates with respect to meeting AEDPA's 
one-year deadline."" Pabon v. Mahanoy , 654 F.3d 385, 401 (3d Cir. 2011). An extraordinary 
circumstance will only warrant equitable tolling if there is ""a causal connection, or nexus, 
between the extraordinary circumstance [] and the petitioner's failure to file a timely federal 
petition."" Ross v. Varano, 712 F.3d 784, 803 (3d Cir. 2013). Specifically , ""if the person seeking 
equitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the 
extraordinary circumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary 
circumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did 
not prevent timely filing."" Brown v. Shannon, 322 F.3d 768 , 773 (3d Cir.2003). The burden is 
on the petitioner to prove that he has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his rights. See Urcinoli 
v. Cathe!, 546 F.3d 269, 277 (3d Cir.2008). 
In addition, a credible claim of actual innocence may serve as an ""equitable exception "" 
that can overcome the bar of AEDPA's one-year limitations period. See McQuiggin v. Perkins, 
569 U.S 383,392 (2013); Wallace v. Mahanoy , 2 F.4th 133, 150-51 (3d Cir. 2021). A petitioner 
satisfies the actual innocence exception by (1) presenting new, reliable evidence of his 
innocence; and (2) showing ""by a preponderance of the evidence"" that ""a reasonable juror would 
have reasonable doubt about his guilt[] in light of the new evidence. "" Id. at 151. 
Petitioner does not assert his actual innocence , but asks the Court to excuse his late filing 
because he is ""doing [his] own legal work prose and learning as [he] go[es]."" (D.I. 3 at 14) A 
6 prisoner's prose status does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance for equitable tolling 
purposes. See Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 160 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that a prose 
petitioner's misunderstanding of the law is insufficient to equitably toll habeas limitations 
period). Nevertheless, since the Court sua sponte raises the issue of timeliness , Petitioner shall 
have another opportunity to address the issues of equitable tolling and actual innocence and show 
cause why his Petition should not be dismissed as time-barred. See Day v. McDonough, 547 
U.S. 198, 209-10 (2006) ( district courts are authorized to consider sua sponte the timeliness of a 
state prisoner's habeas petition, but must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to 
present their positions); United States v. Bendolph, 409 F.3d 155, 165 n.15 (3d Cir. 2005). 
III. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, the Court will summarily dismiss Claims Three and Four 
for failing to assert issues cognizable on federal habeas review. Petitioner, however, shall be 
given an opportunity to show cause why Claims One and Two should not dismissed as time­
barred under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(l) . In his response to this Memorandum and Order, Petitioner 
shall state with specificity any facts establishing a credible claim of actual innocence or facts that 
may entitle him to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations for Claims One and Two. 
Additionally, the Court will grant Petitioner 's Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis. The Court 
will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum.

GREGORYB. WILLIAMS 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE In this action filed by Plaintiffs Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., Zambon S.p.A., and MDD 
US Operations, LLC (together, ""Plaintiffs"") against Defendants MSN Laboratories Private 
Limited, RK Pharma Inc., Prinston Pharmaceutical , Inc., and Prinston Pharmaceutical , Inc., and 
Zenara Pharma Private Limited (together, ""Defendants ""), Plaintiffs allege infringement of U.S. 
Patent No. 8,076,515 (""the '515 patent""), U.S. Patent No. 8,278,485 (""the '485 patent""), and U.S. 
Patent No. 8,283,380 (""the '380 patent""). Before the Court is the issue of claim construction of 
multiple terms in these patents. The Court has considered the parties' joint claim construction brief, 
the accompanying appendix and declarations , the parties' supplemental submissions as requested 
by the Court, and argument at the claim construction hearing (the ""Hearing""). See D.I. 120, 133, 
134, 180, 181, 198, 199. 
I. LEGAL ST AND ARDS 
A. Claim Construction 
""It is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to 
which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude."" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312 
(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Corning Glass Works v. 
Sumitomo Elec. US.A., Inc., 868 F.2d 1251, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (""A claim in a patent provides 
the metes and bounds of the right which the patent confers on the patentee to exclude others from 
making, using, or selling the protected invention ""). ""[T]here is no magic formula or catechism for 
conducting claim construction ."" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1324. The Court is free to attach the 
appropriate weight to appropriate sources ""in light of the statutes and policies that inform patent 
law."" Id. The ultimate question of the proper construction of a patent is a question oflaw, although 
subsidiary fact-finding is sometimes necessary. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 
831, 837 (2015) (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372 (1996)). 
2 ""The words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as 
understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art when read in the context of the specification and 
prosecution history."" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Ent. Am. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 
2012) (citing Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-13). A person of ordinary skill in the art ""is deemed to 
read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term 
appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification."" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 
at 1313. 
""When construing claim terms, the court first looks to, and primarily rely on, the intrinsic 
evidence, including the claims themselves, the specification , and the prosecution history of the 
patent, which is usually dispositive. "" Sunovion Pharms., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 731 F.3d 
1271, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2013). ""Other claims of the patent in question, both asserted and unasserted , 
can ... be valuable"" in discerning the meaning of a disputed claim term because ""claim terms are 
normally used consistently throughout the patent,"" and so, ""the usage of a term in one claim can 
often illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims."" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1314. In 
addition, ""[d]ifferences among claims can also be a useful guide[.]"" Id. For example, ""the 
presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the 
limitation in question is not present in the independent claim."" Id. at 1314-15. 
In addition to the claim, the Court should analyze the specification, which ""is always highly 
relevant to the claim construction analysis ... [as] it is the single best guide to the meaning of a 
disputed term."" Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptroni c, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is 
also possible that ""the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the 
patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's 
lexicography governs."" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1316. ""Even when the specification describes only 
3 a single embodiment, [however,] the claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the 
patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of 
manifest exclusion or restriction. "" Hill-Rom Servs., Inc. v. Stryker Corp., 755 F.3d 1367, 1372 
(Fed. Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) ( quoting Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc., 
358 F.3d 898, 906 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). And, the specification ""is not a substitute for, nor can it be 
used to rewrite, the chosen claim language ."" SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc., 358 F.3d 
870, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 
The Court ""should also consider the patent's prosecution history, if it is in evidence. "" 
Markman, 52 F.3d at 980. The prosecution history ""can often inform the meaning of the claim 
language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor 
limited the invention in the course of prosecution[.] "" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317. 
In some cases, the Court ""will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to 
consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand , for example, the background science or the 
meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period."" Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 841. 
Extrinsic evidence ""consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, 
including expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises."" Markman, 52 F.3d 
at 980. Overall, while extrinsic evidence may be useful, it is ""less significant than the intrinsic 
record in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language."" Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1317 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
B. Indefinit eness 
Section 112 of Title 35 imposes a definiteness requirement on patent claims. 35 U.S.C. § 
112(b) (requiring that the claims ""particularly point[] out and distinctly claim[] the subject matter 
which the inventor .. . regards as the invention ""). ""The primary purpose of the definiteness 
4 requirement is to ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public 
of the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent, so that interested members of the public, 
e.g., competitors of the patent owner, can determine whether or not they infringe."" All Dental 
Prodx, LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods., Inc., 309 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 2002). 
""A patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification 
delineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those 
skilled in the art about the scope of the invention."" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc., 572 
U.S. 898,901 (2014). To determine indefiniteness , courts examine ""the patent record-the claims, 
specification, and prosecution history-to ascertain if they convey to one of skill in the art with 
reasonable certainty the scope of the invention claimed."" Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 
789 F.3d 1335, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Like claim construction, definiteness is a question of law, 
but the Court must sometimes render factual findings based on extrinsic evidence to resolve the 
ultimate issue of definiteness. See, e.g., Sonix Tech. Co. v. Publications Int'!, Ltd., 844 F.3d 1370, 
1376 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also Teva, 135 S. Ct. at 842-43. ""Any fact critical to a holding on 
indefiniteness ... must be proven by the challenger by clear and convincing evidence. "" Intel Corp. 
v. VIA Techs., Inc., 319 F.3d 1357, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Tech. Licensing Corp. v. 
Videotek, Inc., 545 F.3d 1316, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2008). 
II. AGREED-UPON TERMS 
The parties agreed upon the construction of four claim terms as follows: 
Claim Term Agreed-Upon Construction 
""an effective amount"" ""an amount sufficient to treat the selected 
(' 515 patent, claim 40) CNS disorder"" 
5 Plain and ordinary meaning, ""with an 
""classified as"" understanding that Defendants may argue that 
(' 515 patent, claim 44) the terms are indefinite in the 
factual context of an infringement analysis"" 
(D.I. 181) 
Plain and ordinary meaning, ""with an 
""are known to interact with"" understanding that Defendants may argue that 
(' 515 patent, claim 44) the terms are indefinite in the 
factual context of an infringement analysis"" 
(D.I. 181) 
Plain and ordinary meaning, ""with an 
""are known to have HERG channel blocking understanding that Defendants may argue that 
properties "" the terms are indefinite in the 
(' 515 patent, claim 44) factual context of an infringement analysis"" 
(D.I. 181) 
D.I. 180 at 3. The Court will adopt these agreed-upon constructions and will grant Defendants 
leave to renew their indefiniteness argument s. 
III. DISPUTED TERMS 
A. ""stable dose of levodopa"" 
Claim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants' The Court's 
Construction Construction Construction 
""stable dose of ""a dose of levodopa Not amenable to ""a dose of levodopa 
levodopa "" that is neither increased construction; that is neither 
('380 patent , claims nor decreased"" indefinite increased nor 
1-2) decreased"" 
' 
While Plaintiffs maintain that ""stable dose of levodopa"" can be understood according to its 
plain and ordinary meaning, which according to Plaintiffs is ""a dose of levodopa that is neither 
increased nor decreased"", Defendants contend that ""stable dose"" is indefinite as it ""provides no 
indication of the length of time and frequency during that time"" so as to inform a skilled artisan 
6 with reasonable certainty what ""unchanging dose oflevodopa should be administered before it can 
be considered to be 'stable.""' D.I. 133 at 7-9. 
Starting with the claims, claim 1 of the '380 patent recites: 
1. In a method of treating idiopathic Parkinson's disease in a patient receiving 
a stable dose of levodopa, the improvement comprising: 
concurrently administering safinamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof, on an oral dosage schedule of about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 
5 mg/kg/day, 
while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa. 
'380 patent at cl. 1. Claim 2 of the '380 patent recites: 
2. A method of treating idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease comprising: 
administering a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa; and 
concurrently administering safinamide , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt 
thereof, on an oral dosage schedule of about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 5 
mg/kg/day. 
'380 patent at cl. 2. In claim 1, which the parties agree is written in Jepson1 format (D.I. 133 at 5, 
10), the prior art methods of treating idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (""PD"") used a ""stable dose of 
levodopa"". The inventors improved upon the prior art by adding safinamide to the patient's 
treatment regimen ""while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa."" That the method 
of treatment involves ""maintaining"" a patient on that ""stable dose"" suggests that the ""stable dose"" 
does not increase or decrease. Further, given claim l's Jepson format, explaining that treating a 
patient with a ""stable dose of levodopa"" was accomplished in the prior art, the claim language 
suggests that a skilled artisan would understand how to treat PD with levodopa, including how to 
recognize when a patient is receiving a stable levodopa dose. 
1 See Dow Chem. Co. v. Sumitomo Chem. Co., 257 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001) 
( explaining that when a claim ""is written in Jepson format, ... the claim first describes the scope 
of the prior art and then claims an improvement over the prior art.""). 
7 Claim 2 recites, in non-Jepson format, a method of treatment that involves concurrent 
administration of safinamide and a ""stable dose of levodopa. "" That the method of treatment 
involves ""administering a therapeuticall y effective stable dose"" implies that that once the ""stable 
dose"" is ""therapeuticall y effective,"" that dose stays the same. 
Turning to the specification , while the term ""stable dose of levodopa"" is not used, the 
specification describes a clinical trial that studied the effect of safinamide on PD symptoms in a 
""de novo"" group and ""single DA group"", the latter of which ""were treated with one single 
dopamine agonist at stable doses for at least four weeks prior to the screening visit."" '380 patent 
at 20:25-36; 50-60. The specification describes that the single DA group fared better than the de 
novo group ""when safinamide was added to a stabilized dose of a variety of dopamine agonists"" 
(as adjunctive therapy) as compared to when safinamide was administered alone (as monotherap y). 
Id at 3:5-9; see also id at 23:51-55 (describin g favorable results for ""patients under stable 
dopamine agonist treatment ""). Thus, these descriptions suggest that ""stable doses"" and ""stabilized 
dose[s]"" are unchanged doses. 
The prosecution history further supports understanding ""stable dose of levodopa "" as a dose 
that is unchanged. In the Notice of Allowance , the Examiner's explained : ""By 'stable dose,' 
Applicant provides support for this term whereby the dose of L-DOPA is neither increased nor 
decreased to treat a patient with Parkinson 's Disease ... thereby rendering it distinguishable from 
the art."" D.I. 120-24, Ex. Wat JA717. The prosecution history is also consistent with the four­
week time period identified in the specification as the applicant submitted materials describing a 
clinical study in which patients went through a four-week ""levodopa stabilization phase"". See, 
e.g., D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA427; D.I. 134-13, Ex. JJ at JA760; D.I. 120-22, Ex. U at JA507 (""In 
addition, to guard against changes in drugs confounding the results of the clinical trial, patients 
8 must be on stable doses of these medication s for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the study, and 
the drug and the dosage must be maintained at a constant level throughout the course of the study, 
if possible.""). 
Accordingly , in light of the intrinsic record which suggests that a ""stable dose"" is one that 
is unchanged , the Court will construe ""stable dose of levodopa"" to mean ""a dose of levodopa that 
is neither increased nor decreased. "" 
Defendants do not provide an alternate construction. Instead, they contend that the term 
""stable dose of levodopa"" is indefinite , arguing that ""(t]he intrinsic evidence fails to provide 
reasonable certainty as to the required period of time (i.e., days, weeks, months, etc.) and a 
frequency of administration during that period of time (q.d., b.i.d., t.i.d., etc.) for a 'dose of 
levodopa' to become 'stable.""' D.I. 133 at 10. According to Defendants , without any 
measurement scale to determine what constitutes a ""stable dose"", ""stable dose of levodopa"" fails 
to provide objective boundaries to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 38. 
Descriptive words and terms of degree do not render a claim indefinite if there is adequate 
objective guidance regarding the boundaries of the claim. See Niazi Licensing Corp. v. St. Jude 
Med, 30 F.4th 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2022); see also Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech v. ITC, 936 F.3d 
1353, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (""(A] patentee need not define his invention with mathematical 
precision in order to comply with the definiteness requirement."") (internal quotation marks 
omitted). In some circumstances , a person of ordinary skill can ascertain an invention 's boundaries 
from exemplary designs or specific examples offering an ""objective anchor"" for 
comparison. Niazi, 30 F.4th at 1348 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, the intrinsic record provides adequate reference points such that the Court cannot 
conclude ""stable dose oflevodopa "" is indefinite . The specification and prosecution history disclose 
9 a data point of four weeks as constituting being on a ""stable dose."" '380 patent at 20:25-36 ; 20:50-
60; 23:51-55 ; see also D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA427; D.I. 134-13, Ex. JJ at JA760; D.I. 120-22, Ex. 
U at JA507. While Defendants argue that the specification provides conflicting temporal guidance 
because it discloses that in the prior art, patients were administered levodopa for 5-7 years, '380 
patent at 1 :28-33, the specification does not state that the levodopa dosage remained stable for that 
5-7 year time-period. Rather, the specification explains that patients treated with levodopa began 
to exhibit motor fluctuations after that time period. '380 patent at 1 :28-33. Accordingly, the 
specification 's four-week period provides an objective anchor from which a skilled artisan can 
determine the scope of the claim. 
Defendants further contend that the specification 's disclosures are inapposite because they 
relate to a stable dose of a dopamine agonist, which ""would be unhelpful to [ a person of ordinary 
skill in the art] deciphering the meaning of a 'stable dose of levodopa."" ' D.I. 133 at 10-22. But 
Defendants do not support their assertion with any evidence as to what a person of ordinary skill 
in the art would understand about the claims' scope-even after the Court invited Defendants to 
do so.2 Thus, ""Defendants ' attorney argument falls far short of meeting their burden to prove, by 
clear and convincing evidence ,"" that the '380 patent fails to reasonably inform a person of ordinary 
skill in the art about the scope of the invention. Dasso Int'!, Inc. v. MOSO N Am., Inc., No. 17-
01574-RGA, 2019 WL 2135855 , at *2 (D. Del. May 16, 2019); see also MiiCs & Partners Am.,

Claim Term Plaintiffs ' Defendants ' I\ The Court's 
Construction Construction Construction 
""maintaining"" Plain and ordinary Not amenable to construction; Plain and ordinary 
(' 3 80 patent, meaning, which is indefinite meaning, which is 
claim 1) ""keeping"" ""keeping"" 
While Plaintiffs argue that ""maintaining "" can be understood according to its plain and 
ordinary meaning, which is ""keeping"" , Defendants contend the term is indefinite . D.I. 133 at 23-
29. 
The intrinsic record supports construing ""maintaining "" as ""keeping"". Starting with the 
claims, claim 1 (as discussed supra) describes the prior art method of treating a PD patient who is 
""receiving a stable dose of levodopa "", the concurrent administration of safinamide to that patient, 
and explains that safinamide should be given ""while maintaining the patient"" on the stable dose of 
levodopa . '380 patent at cl. 1. ""[M]aintaining "" appears to refer back to the prior art method, 
requiring the patient to be ""maintained "" or kept on that same stable dose of levodopa . Indeed, 
dependent claim 53 reflects this concept, requiring that the patient receiving a stable dose of 
levodopa in claim 1 be administered safinamide for at least 12 weeks. '380 patent at cl. 5. A skilled 
artisan would understand that the patient treated according to claim 5' s method was being 
""maintain[ ed]"" on the stable levodopa dose for those 12 weeks as well. 
Turning to the specification , it uses ""maintaining "" in other contexts to mean ""keeping."" For 
example, the specification describes that ""[ o ]ther symptoms of PD include poor balance, due to 
3 Claim 5 recites: ""The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein safinamide , or 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered for at least 12 weeks."" 
11 the impairment or loss of the reflexes that adjust posture in order to maintain balance."" '380 patent 
at 10:47-49. It discusses adding buffers to a formulation in ""amounts sufficient to maintain the 
pH"" within a specified range, and explains ways a composition's fluidity ""can be maintained. "" Id. 
at 17: 35-40. 
During prosecution , the applicant distinguished the prior art by arguing that it did not teach 
that the levodopa dose given to patients could ""be maintained without reduction when further 
agents are added to the treatment regimen."" D.I. 120-21, Ex. T at JA482. Additionally, the 
applicant added the clause ""while maintaining the patient on a stable dose of levodopa"" to replace 
""without reducing the patient's dose of concurrently administered levodopa"" in response to an 
examiner interview so as to ""align more precisely with written description support in the 
specification."" D.I. 120-23, Ex.Vat JA710-71 l. 
Thus, the intrinsic record suggests that ""maintaining "" can be understood according to its 
plain and ordinary meaning, which is ""keeping"". The Court will adopt that construction. 
Defendants do not contest this construction , 4 but argue that ""maintaining"" suffers not only 
from the same indefiniteness as ""stable dose of levodopa"", but it also introduces ""additional 
indefiniteness: for how long after safinamide is added to the patient's treatment regimen must the 
'stable dose' be maintained , and what is the significance of a change in the patient's levodopa dose 
after that time?"" D.I. 133 at 25. But for the reasons identified above, including that Defendants ' 
do not support their indefiniteness arguments with any evidence as to what a person of ordinary 
skill in the art would understand about the claims' scope, Defendants have not met their burden 
and the Court does not find ""maintaining "" to be indefinite. 
4D.I.133 at 25. 
12 C. ""a therapeut ically effective stable dose of levodopa"" 
Claim Term Plaintiffs' Defendants ' F The Court's 
Construction Construction Construction 
""a dose of levodopa ""a dose of levodopa 
sufficient to treat ""a therapeutically sufficient to treat idiopathic effective stable dose idiopathic Parkinson 's Not amenable to Parkinson's disease oflevodopa"" ('380 disease that is neither construction; indefinite that is neither patent, claim 2) increased nor increased nor decreased "" decreased"" 
Plaintiffs propose construing ""a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa"" as ""a 
dose of levodopa sufficient to treat idiopathic Parkinson 's disease that is neither increased nor 
decreased"", while Defendants contend that this term is indefinite. D.I. 133 at 30-33. 
Plaintiffs' construction is supported by the intrinsic record. Starting with the claims, claim 
2 of the '3 80 patent recites ( as described above) a method of treating idiopathic PD and explains 
that to accomplish such treatment , a ""therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa"" is 
administered concurrently with safinamide. '380 patent at cl. 2. The specification describes 
treatment kits that ""include a therapeutically effective dose of an agent for treating or at least 
partially alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease (e.g., levodopa plus carbidopa 
(SINEMET®), levodopa plus controlled release carbidopa (SINEMET®-CR), levodopa plus 
benserazi de (MADOP AR®), levodopa plus controlled release benserazide (MADOP AR®-HBS), 
[and other Parkinson's agents] and safinamide (or a safinamide derivative) .... "" '380 patent at 
5:54-60. And the prosecution history explains that a ""therapeutically effective"" dose refers to a 
""clinically-relevant"" dose-that is, a dose that is effective to treat PD. D.I. 120-13, Ex.Lat JA357; 
see also D.I. 120-18, Ex. Q at JA405 (""safinamide can be added to a stable and therapeutically 
effective L-dopa regimen, providing additional symptomatic benefit""). 
13 Thus, the claims read in light of the specification and prosecution history suggest that the 
stable levodopa dose be of an unchanging amount sufficient to achieve the desired goal of treating 
PD. Accordingly, the Court will construe ""a therapeutically effective stable dose of levodopa "" to 
mean ""a dose oflevodopa sufficient to treat idiopathic Parkinson's disease that is neither increased 
nor decreased. "" 
Defendants argue indefiniteness by incorporating their previous arguments as to ""stable 
dose of levodopa "" and ""maintaining."" D.I. 133 at 32-33. For the reasons identified above, 
including that Defendants ' do not support their assertions with any evidence as to what a person 
of ordinary skill in the art would understand about the claims' scope, Defendants have not met 
their burden and the Court does not find ""a therapeuticall y effective stable dose of levodopa "" to 
be indefinite.

thereof' and not indefinite 
('515 patent, claims 32-35, 
40-44; '485 patent, claim 
37) 
14 The parties principally dispute the meaning of the phrase ""high purity"" in disputed terms 
of the '515 and '485 patents. While Plaintiffs argue that ""high purity"" refers to safinamide and 
ralfinarnide preparations with lower than 0.03% by weight of impurities , D.I. 133 at 34, Defendants 
contend that ""high purity"" refers to the ""overall chemical purity of a safinarnide preparation ,"" 
resulting in a term that is ambiguous and thus, indefinite . Id. at 42. 
Starting with the claims, claim 32 of the '515 patent recites: 
32. High purity safinamide or ralfinamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid 
salt thereof with a content of the respective impurity (S)-2-[3-(3-fluorobenzyl)-4-
(3-fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylarnino]propanarnide (Ila) or (S)-2-[3-(2-fluorobenzyl)-
4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylarnino]propanarnide (lib) [graphic omitted] or their 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, which is lower than 0.03% (by weight). 
'515 patent at cl. 32. Defendants argue that ""Plaintiffs ' construction would render half of the claim 
language that starts with 'with a content' completel y superfluous"" because ""high purity"" modifies 
""safinarnide "" whereas ""lower than 0.03%"" refers ""to a required level of an impurity, "" meaning that 
""'[h]igh purity' does not modify ""a content of impurity Ila,"" D.I. 133 at 39. But that claim 
language can be read to reflect the inventors ' discovery disclosing a new process for keeping 
specific toxic impurities below 0.03% by weight in large scale preparations of safinamide and 
ralfinarnide. See, e.g., '515 patent at 1:60-2:27 ; 7:1-3, 7:11-22, 7:57-8:7. 
The specification supports this reading. It consistently uses the phrases ""high purity"", 
""highly pure,"" and ""high purity degree"" to specify safinamide or ralfinamide preparations that have 
less than 0.03% by weight of impurities Ila and lib and their salts; not to refer to an overall 
chemical purity level: 
Moreover , another object of this invention is to provide 
pharmaceutical formulations comprising safinarnide or ralfinarnide 
or a salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, preferably 
methanesulfonic acid, as the active agents wherein the content of the 
respective dibenzyl derivatives (Ila) and (Ilb) or the salt thereof with 
15 a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, e.g. methanesulfonic acid, is 
lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % (by weight) with 
respect to the above said active agents. These new pharmaceutical 
formulations were neither suggested nor achievable by applying the 
pharmaco-toxicological knowledge regarding safinamide and 
ralfinamide nor by using these active agents prepared according to 
the methods available in the state of the art. 
Therefore, said pharmaceutical formulations comprising safinamide 
or ralfinamide or the salts thereof with a pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid, preferably methanesulfonic acid, having the above 
said high purity degree constitute a further object of this invention. 
Id. at 7:57-8:8; see also id. at 7:50-56 (""high purity degree"" safinamide or ralfinamide has a content 
of impurities Ila or Ilb or the salts thereof ""lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % by 
weight""), id. at 8:50-60 (""high purity safinamide "" has a content of impurity Ila or a salt thereof 
""lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01% by weight""), id. at 9:1-12 (""high purity 
ralfinamide"" has a content impurities Ilb or a salt there of ""lower than 0.03%, preferably lower 
than 0.01 % by weight""); see also id. at Abstract (""A process for obtaining therapeutically active 
2-[4-(3-and 2-(fluorobenzyloxy)benzylarnino]propanamides and their salts with pharmaceutically 
acceptable acids with high purity degree, in particular , with a content of dibenzyl derivatives 
impurities lower than 0.03%, preferably lower than 0.01 % by weight.""). The specification also 
includes multiple examples relating to the chemical synthesis of safinamide or ralfinamide of a 
""High Purity Degree."" In those examples , the purity information related is the content of impurity 
Ila or Ilb by weight. See id. at Examples 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. In view of these citations, Defendants ' 
assertion that ""[n]othing in the specification could possibly lead a POSA to believe that 'high 
purity' refers only to a low level of a specific impurity, such as Ila or Ilb"" is not persuasive. D.I. 
133 at 40. 
16 Defendants, after pointing out that there is ""no definition of 'high purity""' in the 
specification, turn to expert testimony to elucidate that term's meaning. Id. But that effort divorces 
claim construction from the intrinsic record, and cannot be squared in view of the Federal Circuit's 
guidance that ""the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. 
Usually it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term."" Phillips, 
415 F.3d at 1315 (quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, Defendants ' view that ""high purity"" refers 
to a ""'high' (but undefined) level of an overall chemical purity of a safinarnide preparation ,"" rather 
than to any particular impurity, obtains considerably less support in the specification . D.I. 133 at 
40. 
Defendants also argue that, when applying Plaintiffs ' construction to certain unasserted 
claims of the '515 patent, claim 29 takes on the same scope as claim 12. D.I. 133 at 47-48. Claim 
29 recites: 
The process as in claim 12 wherein safinamide or ralfinamide or 
their pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, have a content of the 
respective impurity (S)-2-3-(3-fluo robenzyl)-4-(3-
fluorobenzyloxy)-benzylaminopropana mide (Ila) or (S)-2-3-(2 -
fluorobenzyl)-4-(2-fluorobenzy loxy)-benzylaminopropanarnide 
(Ilb) [graphic omitted] or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid 
salts, which is lower than 0.03% (by weight). 
Claim 12 recites: 
The process as in claim 8 wherein the 4-(3-fluoroben 
Zyloxy)benzaldehyde or 4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)benzalde hyde of 
formula (IV a) or (IVb) employed as the starting material to obtain 
the Schiff base intermediate of formula (Vla) or (Vlb) contains less 
than 0.03% (by weight), of the respective impurities 3-(3-
fluorobenzyl)-4-(3-fluorobenzy loxy)benzaldehyde (Va) or 3-(2-
fluorobenzyl)-4-(2-fluo robenzylox y)benzaldehyde (Vb) [graphic 
omitted] 
17 According to Defendants , the ""'only additional limitation in claim 29 is that the impurities Ila and 
Ilb are limited to less than 0.03% by weight. If 'high purity' were defined as the limitation of these 
two specific impurities, this additional element in dependent claim 29 would not provide any 
further limitation."" D.I. 133 at 48. But ""claim differentiation is a guide, not a rigid rule, and does 
not alter a construction otherwise compelled by the intrinsic record."" Ultravision Techs., LLC v. 
Govision, LLC, No. 2022-1098, 2023 WL 2182285, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 23, 2023) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the intrinsic record indicates that the scope the 
patentee ascribed to ""high purity"" is safinamide or ralfinamide preparations that have less than 
0.03% by weight of impurities Ila and Ilb and their salts. That the patentee also decided to claim 
with greater particularity that safinamide or ralfinamide impurities are less than 0.03% by weight 
in claim 29 ""does not overcome that conclusion in these circumstances."" Ultravision , 2023 WL 
2182285, at *4. 
Accordingly , the Court will construe the ""high purity"" terms to mean ""safinamide or 
ralfinamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid salt thereof that has lower than 0.03% (by 
weight) of impurity IIa7 or impurity Ilb8 or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts."" 
Defendants argue that, under Defendants ' proposed construction , the ""high purity"" terms 
are indefinite. D.I. 133 at 37-38. Defendants do not argue indefiniteness under Plaintiffs ' 
construction. As the Court has declined to adopt Defendants ' proposed construction, the Court 
concludes the ""high purity"" terms are not indefinite . 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The Court will adopt the parties' agreed-upon constructions and construe the disputed 
claim terms as described above. The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum 
Opinion.

WILLIAMS, U.S. District Judge:
L INTRODUCTION

In March 2022, Plaintiff William Mateer Wolffe, proceeding pro se,
commenced this action. Before the Court is a motion to strike and dismiss filed by
Defendants Days Inn Worldwide, Inc., Wyndham Worldwide, Inc., Wyndham
Hotel Group, LLC, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, LLC, Wyndham Hotels and
Resorts, Inc., and Wyndham Hotel Management, Inc. (the “Hotel Defendants”)
(D.I. 17); a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, filed by Defendants
Beaufort County Sheriff's Office, Lyle E. Harris, Jeremy Hewitt, and P.J. Tanner
(the “Beaufort County Defendants”) (D.I. 21); a motion to dismiss for lack of
personal jurisdiction filed by Walter J. Galdenzi, 9 Marina, LLC, Southern Cross
Investments, Inc. and Suzanne Mark (the “Galdenzi Defendants”) (D.I. 46); a
motion for removal of attorneys of record for fraud on the Court, filed by Plaintiff
(D.I. 51); and a motion to compel an investigation for fraud on the Court, filed by
Plaintiff (D.I. 53). The matters are fully briefed.
Il. BACKGROUND

The Complaint is over 600 pages long, contains over 1,600 numbered
paragraphs, and includes 67 pages of exhibits. He alleges that in April 2020 during
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he was 88 years old and living in a Days Inn

hotel located in Hilton Head, South Carolina. The hotel shut down in response the

{
pandemic, and Plaintiff was forcefully evicted, despite having nowhere to go and,
as a result of his age, being at high risk serious for serious complications or death
from COVID-19. (DL. 1). Notably, he asserts that “[t]his Court has personal
jurisdiction because the events giving rise to the matter in controversy occurred
within the State of South Carolina and they occurred in Beaufort County South
Carolina.” (Jd. at { 194). He also expounds upon the connections of the Galdenzi
Defendants and Beuafort County Defendants to the state of South Carolina for
personal jurisdiction purposes. (/d. at JJ 195, 197-99, 201-09).

In their motion to strike and dismiss, the Hotel Defendants argue the
expansive complaint fails to comply with Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, which requires “a short plain statement of the claim showing that the
pleaders is entitled to relief.” (D.I. 18 at 5-7). The motions to dismiss filed by the
Beaufort County Defendants and Galdenzi Defendants argue both that this Court
lacks personal jurisdiction over them, and that venue is improper in the District of
Delaware. (D.I. 22 at 2-6; D.I. 47 at 5-10).

In February 2022, a month before filing this action, Plaintiff filed an
essentially identical complaint in the District of South Carolina. See Wolffe v.
Galdenzi, et al., No. 9:22-cv-00548 (D.S.C.). In March 2022, days before
initiating this action, he also filed an essentially identical complaint in the Eastern

District of Pennsylvania. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, et al., No. 2:22-cv-994 (E.D.
2
Pa.).! In September 2022, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the South Carolina
action, with prejudice, indicating that he would instead proceed with his cases in
Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Wolffe, No. 9:22-cv-00548, D.I. 75.

In the Pennsylvania case, the Hotel Defendants filed a motion to strike and
dismiss that was essentially identical to the motion they filed in this proceeding.
Also in the Pennsylvania case, the Beaufort County Defendants and Galdenzi
Defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction that were
essentially identical to the motions they filed in this proceeding, except they of
course argued that Pennsylvania, rather than Delaware, did not have personal
jurisdiction over them, and that the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was not the
proper venue.

In October 2021, in the Pennsylvania case, the court granted the Beaufort
County Defendants’ motion to dismiss, noting that all of his arguments for
personal jurisdiction appeared to be repeated from his complaint in the South
Carolina case and accordingly directed at South Carolina, and that “[a]bsent from
Mr. Wolffe’s complaint are allegations that the Beaufort County defendants have
any contacts with Pennsylvania, or that any of the acts or omissions giving rise to
this action occurred in Pennsylvania. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, 2022 WL 14813700,
| Plaintiff additionally filed an essentially identical complaint in Pennsylvania state

court, which was removed to federal court and then consolidated with his federal
case. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, et al., No. 2:22-cv-2882 (E.D. Pa.).
3
at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 2022) (emphasis original). The Court also concluded that
venue was not proper as to the Beaufort County Defendants. Jd. at *3-4. In
November 2022, also in the Pennsylvania case, the court granted the Hotel
Defendants motion to strike and dismiss, holding that “Mr. Wolffe’s complaint is
rife with redundant and verbose recitations of facts and rambling and unclear
allegations, making it difficult to parse out which claims he is asserting against
which defendants,” and that “Wolffe’s complaint fails to meet the Rule 8(a)(2)
standard requiring a “short and plain statement of the claims.” Wolffe v. Galdenzi,
2022 WL 16722318, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 4, 2022). The Galdenzi filed their
motion to dismiss in the Pennsylvania case in January 2023, but three days later,
before the court ruled on the motion, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case,
indicating that he would proceed with his claims in this Court. Wolffe v. Galdenzi,
et al., No. 2:22-cv-994, D.I. 61.
I. LEGAL STANDARDS

A. Rule 8(a)

The Court has the power to dismiss a complaint that fails to comply with
Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Ala’ Ad-Din Bey v. United
States DOJ, 457 F. App’x 90, 91 (3d Cir. Jan. 11, 2012) (per curiam) (affirming
district court’s dismissal). Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

requires “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is

4
entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Each averment must be ""simple,
concise, and direct.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). “Taken together,” Rules 8(a) and
8(d)(1) “underscore the emphasis placed on clarity and brevity by the federal
pleading rules.” In re: Westinghouse Sec. Litig., 90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir. 1996)
(citation omitted). Dismissal pursuant to Rule 8 has been found warranted where a
complaint is rambling, unclear, and/or unwieldy. See Trillo v. Kent, 477 F. App’x
881, 882 (3d Cir. Sept. 6, 2012) (per curiam). Dismissal under Rule 8 has also
been held proper when a complaint “left the defendants having to guess what of the
many things discussed constituted [a cause of action].” Binsack v. Lackawanna
Cnty. Prison, 438 F. App’x 158, 160 (3d Cir. July 21, 2011) (per curiam).

B. Rule 12(b)(2)

Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court
may dismiss a suit for lack of jurisdiction over the person. Although Rule 8 does
not require a plaintiff to set forth in the complaint “the grounds upon which the
court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant,” Hansen v. Neumueller GmbH,
163 F.R.D. 471, 474 (D. Del. 1995), “once a defendant has raised a jurisdictional
defense, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving by affidavits or other competent
evidence that jurisdiction is proper.” Dayhoff Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co., 86 F.3d 1287,
1302 (3d Cir. 1996). If the district court does not hold an evidentiary hearing, the

court should resolve any factual disputes in the plaintiffs favor and should deny

5
the motion if the plaintiff's evidence establishes “a prima facie case of personal
jurisdiction.” Eurofins Pharma US Holdings v. BioAlliance Pharma SA, 623 F.3d
147, 155 (3d Cir. 2010).

Two requirements, one statutory and one constitutional, must be satisfied for
personal jurisdiction to exist over a defendant. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. C
& C Helicopter Sales, Inc., 295 F. Supp. 2d 400, 403 (D. Del. 2002). “First, a
federal district court may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state
in which the court sits to the extent authorized by the law of that state.” Jd. (citing
Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)). The Court must, therefore, determine whether there is a
statutory basis for jurisdiction under the Delaware long-arm statute. Jd. (citing 10
Del. C. § 3104(c)). “Second, because the exercise of jurisdiction must also
comport with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the Court
must determine if an exercise of jurisdiction violates [Defendant’s] constitutional
right to due process.” Jd. (citing International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S.
310 (1945)).

“Once a jurisdictional defense has been raised, the plaintiff bears the burden
of establishing with reasonable particularity that sufficient minimum contacts have
occurred between the defendant and the forum state to support jurisdiction.” Jd.
(citing Provident Nat’! Bank v. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 819 F.2d 434,

437 (3d Cir. 1987). Plaintiff may establish jurisdictional facts through sworn
6
affidavits or other competent evidence. See Time Share Vacation Club v. Atlantic
Resorts, Ltd., 735 F.2d 61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984).

Plaintiff must demonstrate either specific or general jurisdiction. Specific
jurisdiction arises when the particular cause of action arose from Defendant’s
activities within the forum state. In contrast, general jurisdiction does not require
Defendant’s connections be related to the particular cause of action, but that
Defendants have continuous or systematic contacts with the forum state. American
Bio Medica Corp. v. Peninsula Drug Analysis Co, Inc., 1999 WL 615175 (D. Del.
1999). “[A]t no point may a plaintiff rely on the bare pleadings alone in order to
withstand a defendant’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of in personam
jurisdiction.” Jd. Plaintiff is required to respond to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction with actual proof, not mere allegations. Id.
See also Hurley v. Cancun Playa Oasis In’tl Hotels, 1999 WL 718556, at *1 (E.D.
Pa. Aug. 31, 1999) (stating that “[g]eneral averments in an unverified complaint or
response without the support of sworn affidavits or other competent evidence are
insufficient to establish jurisdictional facts”).

IV. DISCUSSION

The Court will adopt the reasoning of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania

and grant Defendants’ motions to dismiss. The Court agrees that the Hotel

Defendants and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that dismissal without

7
prejudice of the approximately 600-page complaint under Rule 8(a) is appropriate.
See Trillo, 477 F. App’x at 882 (affirming dismissal under Rule 8(a) of “rambling
and unclear” complaint); Wolffe, 2022 WL 16722318, at *2 (holding that “Mr.
Wolffe’s complaint is rife with redundant and verbose recitations of facts and
rambling and unclear allegations, making it difficult to parse out which claims he
is asserting against which defendants”).

The Court also adopts the reasoning of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
and the Beaufort County Defendants and holds both that personal jurisdiction is
lacking over these Defendants and that venue is not proper in this Court. See
Wolffe, 2022 WL 14813700, at *3 (“Absent from Mr. Wolffe’s complaint are
allegations that the Beaufort County defendants have any contacts with
[Delaware], or that any of the acts or omissions giving rise to this action occurred
in [Delaware].”). Finally, the Court will adopt the same reasoning with regard to
the Galdenzi Defendants. See Id.

Plaintiffs pending motions for removal of attorneys of record for fraud on
the Court, and to compel an investigation for fraud on the Court, will denied as
frivolous. See Wolffe v. Galdenzi, 2022 WL 14813702 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 2022)

(denying essentially identically motions as frivolous).
Vv. CONCLUSION

For the above reasons, the Court will: (1) grant the Hotel Defendants’
motion to strike and dismiss (D.I. 17); (2) grant the Beaufort County Defendants’
motion to dismiss (D.I. 21); (3) grant the Galdenzi Defendants’ motion to dismiss
(D.I. 46); and (4) deny Plaintiff's pending motions (D.I. 51, 53). Plaintiff will be
given leave to file an amended complaint against the Hotel Defendants.

An appropriate order will be entered.

FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

MARQUINEZ et al., )
Plaintiffs,
v. Civil Action No. 12-cv-695-RGA-SRF
DOLE FOOD COMPANY INC. et al., 5
Defendants.
MEMORANDUM OPINION

At Wilmington this 14th day of April, 2023, the court having considered the parties’
submissions regarding Luis Antonio Aguilar Marquinez, et al. (“Plaintiffs”) Motion to Allocate
in Whole or in Part the Court Appointed Expert Witness Costs (“Motion”), (D.I. 419), IT IS
HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED for the reasons discussed below:

1. Background.” This motion concems the allocation of costs for a court appointed
expert witness on Ecuadorian law. In Chavez and Marquinez, motions for summary judgment

were filed in the mass toxic tort case by the participating Defendants’ concerning the Ecuadorian

' The briefing for the pending Motion is as follows: Plaintiffs’ Motion and opening brief (D.I.
419), Defendants’ answering brief (D.I. 426), and Plaintiffs’ reply brief (D.I. 429). In addition,
the expert witness, Professor Angel R. Oquendo, submitted a response to Plaintiffs’ Motion.
(D.I. 427)

2 This case was consolidated with eight other cases pending in this district and was designated as
lead on December 5, 2019. (D.I. 195; see No. 12-695-RGA-SRF; No. 12-696-RGA; No. 12-
697-RGA-SRF; No. 12-698-RGA; No. 12-699-RGA; No. 12-700-RGA; No. 12-701-RGA; and
No. 12-702-RGA) This case and Chavez et al. v. Dole Food Company, Inc., et al, No. 12-697-
RGA-SRF are relevant to the present Motion as they concern the Ecuadorian Plaintiffs.

3 Participating Defendants include: (1) Dole Food Co. Inc., Dole Fresh Fruit Co., Standard Fruit
Company, and Standard Fruit and Steamship Company, who filed for summary judgment in
Chavez (D.I. 333); (2) Dow Chemical Company, Occidental Chemical Corp., AMVAC Chemical
Corp., and Shell Oil Co., who filed for summary judgment in Marquinez (D.1. 354); and (3)
Chiquita Brands Int’! Inc., Chiquita Fresh N. Am. LLC, and Chiquita Brands LLC, who joined in
the aforementioned summary judgment motions (D.I. 355). Defendant Del Monte Fresh Produce
N.A. Inc. is not a participating Defendant for purposes of this Motion. (D.I. 426 at 1 n.1)
Plaintiffs who claim to have been injured as a result of alleged exposure to an agricultural
chemical called dibromochloropropane (“DBCP”) while working on banana farms. (D.I. 333;
D.L 354; see D.I. 1 at J] 5, 104-05) The Ecuadorian Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary
judgment. (D.I. 339) The summary judgment motions contained conflicting expert declarations
regarding the application of Ecuadorian law. (D.I. 341; D.I. 356-1, Ex. B; D.I. 360-2, Ex. 2)

2. On August 5, 2021, the Honorable Richard G. Andrews ordered the parties to
meet and confer and nominate an expert to assist the court in answering whether a protection
action under Ecuadorian constitutional law is an appropriate mechanism for Plaintiffs’ claims.
(D.I. 383) The parties recommended Professor Angel R. Oquendo. (D.I. 387) The court
required a neutral expert to resolve the conflict between both sides’ experts on (1) whether a
plaintiff could bring a protection action for events that occurred prior to 2008, the date the
Ecuadorian Constitution was adopted, and (2) whether Plaintiffs’ claims could appropriately be
brought as a protection action. (D.I. 388 at 2) The court appointed Professor Oquendo and
tasked him “to opine on matters of Ecuadorian law relevant to the applicability of the Delaware
Borrowing Statute.” (D.I. 389 at J 1)

3. The court ordered the parties to compensate Professor Oquendo as follows:

Professor Oquendo shall be compensated for his services at his usual hourly rate. Others

assisting him shall be compensated at their usual hourly rates. Professor Oquendo shall

send itemized statements for services and expenses directly to counsel for the parties after
the completion of his report, and he shall receive payment directly from counsel for the
parties in a timely fashion. The compensation and expenses of Professor Oquendo shall,
unless otherwise ordered, be shared equally by the parties (that is, 50% by Plaintiffs and

50% by the relevant Defendants). Any objections or disputes as to Professor Oquendo’s

compensation, costs, and/or expenses shall be presented to the Court in a timely

application.

(Id. at | 5 (emphasis added))
4. On December 14, 2021, Professor Oquendo submitted his report. (D.I. 393)
Defendants then desired to depose Professor Oquendo. (D.I. 396) On January 21, 2022, the
court ordered that Defendants should bear one hundred percent of the cost for the deposition
unless Plaintiffs questioned Professor Oquendo “more than a de minimis amount,” in which
Defendants could move to seek a proportionate contribution from the Plaintiffs. (D.I. 398)

5. More than eight months after issuing his expert report, Professor Oquendo was
still owed Plaintiffs’ half of his expert witness fees. Therefore, on August 19, 2022, the court
issued a Show Cause Order requiring the Plaintiffs to demonstrate why they should not be
sanctioned for withholding their fifty percent share. (D.I. 411) Plaintiffs’ counsel responded
that they had good cause to withhold payment because they intended to challenge Professor
Oquendo’s fees but did not want to do so until after his expert deposition so as not to risk biasing
Professor Oquendo against Plaintiffs in offering his opinion on highly contested legal questions.
(I. 414)

6. Professor Oquendo’s deposition took place on September 19, 2022. (D.I. 426, Ex.
A) On September 30, 2022, the court held the Show Cause Hearing, and the Plaintiffs deposited
their fifty percent share, which totaled $168,898.00, with the court. (D.I. 416; see also docket
entry dated October 13, 2022) On October 14, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed the present Motion and

the court discharged the Show Cause Order. (D.I. 418; D.I. 419)

4 Defendants say the Plaintiffs spent more than a de minimus amount of time questioning the
expert, about 18% of the deposition time, but Defendants have not moved for contribution from
Plaintiffs towards the deposition fees charged by Professor Oquendo. (D.I. 426 at 5 n.7; see D.L.
398)
7. Legal Standard. Pursuant to the Federal Rule of Evidence 706(c)(2), a court
appointed expert witness “is entitled to a reasonable compensation, as set by the court. This
compensation is payable . . . by the parties in the proportion and at the time that the court
directs—and the compensation is then charged like other costs.”

8. Plaintiffs now move to shift the entire expense of the court appointed expert’s
report to the Defendants. Plaintiffs’ rationale is that the Defendants were the “prime movers”
creating the need for the expert’s opinion because Defendants disputed whether Plaintiffs could
bring a protection action. (D.J. 419 at 2-6) Plaintiffs contend that the expert supports their
position, therefore, it was a needless expense for resolving an issue that should not have been
challenged. (/d.) In addition, the Plaintiffs claim they are indigent, and the Defendants have
greater resources, so it is not unreasonable for the Defendants to bear the full expense for the
expert’s report. (/d. at 4-5) Alternatively, Plaintiffs ask the court to reduce the fees charged by
the expert. (/d. at 6-7) The court rejects Plaintiffs’ arguments on all grounds as discussed, infra.

9. The Expert’s Opinions Were Necessary to Assist the Court. The Plaintiffs
argue that the Defendants should bear the entire cost of Professor Oquendo’s fees because the
Defendants’ litigation position, that the Plaintiffs’ claims were time barred, inter alia, caused the
need for the expert’s report. (D.I. 419 at 2-6) Moreover, the ultimate opinions offered by the
expert favored Plaintiffs’ position on the disputed issues of Ecuadorian law. (/d.) Plaintiffs
argue that shifting the cost is appropriate and tracks the rationale for the court’s order that
Defendants pay the full cost of the expert’s deposition. (Jd. at 3)

10. The court is not persuaded by the Plaintiffs’ argument that the Defendants should
bear the entire cost because they unreasonably took a position that necessitated the court’s

retention of the expert. The case on which Plaintiffs rely does not support their position for cost-
shifting based on unfavorable outcome and instead supports the court’s original equal
apportionment. (See D.I. 419 at 5) See Leesona Corp. v. Varta Batteries, Inc., 522 F. Supp.
1304, 1312 n.21 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (noting that the court appointed expert was “paid in equal
shares by plaintiff and defendant”).

11. Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants caused the parties to incur an unnecessary
expense for the expert fails to acknowledge that Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in both
the Marquinez and Chavez cases, thus, a conflict in application of Ecuadorian law was presented
for which the court required an expert. The court needed to identify the applicable statute of
limitations for Plaintiffs’ claims under Ecuadorian law in order to apply the Delaware Borrowing
Statute. Due to both sides’ conflicting interpretation of Ecuadorian law, the court acted within
its discretion under Rule 706 to appoint a neutral expert and apportion the expense between the
parties.

12. Defendants complied with the court’s Order assessing them with the total cost of
the expert’s deposition because Defendants noticed the deposition. (D.I. 410) Defendants’
payment has no bearing on Plaintiffs’ compliance with their obligations under the court’s
original order apportioning expenses for the expert’s report.

13. Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ argument that expert witness fees should be assessed
against the side the opinion allegedly disfavors is unpersuasive and lacks any authority
employing such a calculation based on hindsight. Professor Oquendo provided his expert
opinion, and it remains for the court to determine how it affects the viability of the Ecuadorian

Plaintiffs’ claims.
14. Plaintiffs Failed to Demonstrate that Payment of their Share of Fees for the
Expert Would Pose an Undue Burden. The Plaintiffs argue that they are “impecunious,” so
justice requires shifting costs to the Defendant corporations which “have far more resources to
bear this expense.” (D.I. 419 at 4-5) Plaintiffs briefly argue that the cost “plac[es] a substantial
burden on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s resources to prosecute this litigation.” (/d. at 6 n.3; see also D.I.
429 at 4) The court will not entertain arguments placed in a footnote nor will it infer that a
financial hardship is present without supporting evidence. Plaintiffs have already deposited their
fifty percent share of Professor Oquendo’s fees with the court, so they have demonstrated their
ability to pay their allocated share.

15. When the court entered an Order allocating the costs of the expert to be “shared
equally by the parties,” it left open the opportunity to raise “[a]ny objections or disputes as to
Professor Oquendo’s compensation . . . in a timely application.” (D.I. 389 at ] 5) Plaintiffs did
not voice concern that allocating them with an equal share of the expense would be unduly
burdensome or constrain their ability to litigate their case. Further, Plaintiffs did not object to the
allocation, nor did they ask to defer allocation until the expert issued his opinion. The Plaintiffs
have long been on notice of the court’s allocation of the fees. They chose to avoid paying their
share until the court resorted to a Show Cause Order and finally ordered them to deposit their
share with the court. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ Motion to re-allocate the cost based on financial
burden is unpersuasive.

16. The court also finds that Plaintiffs have failed to support their cost-shifting
argument with binding authority from the Third Circuit. The cases cited by Plaintiffs are from
courts outside of this circuit and do not address re-apportionment of costs for the court appointed

expert once the court has ordered an equal allocation. (See D.I. 419 at 3-5) The cases that
Plaintiffs cite are distinguishable in that they involve court appointed medical experts to render
opinions on injuries alleged by prisoners in civil rights actions. See e.g., Claiborne v. Blauser,
934 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2019) (discussing Rule 706 in the context of a court appointed
medical expert in a prisoner’s civil rights action); Ledford v. Sullivan, 105 F.3d 354, 359-60 (7th
Cir. 1997) (affirming the district court’s decision denying the plaintiff's request to appoint a
court expert to opine on the plaintiff's medical condition in a civil rights action); McKinney v.
Anderson, 924 F.2d 1500, 1510-11 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. granted, judgment vacated on other
grounds, 502 U.S. 903 (1991), on remand, judgment reinstated, 959 F.2d 853, 854 (9th Cir.
1992) (recommending that the district court appoint an expert witness to opine on the health
effects and concentration levels of secondary cigarette smoke in the prisoner’s civil rights
action). These cases are inapplicable to the present situation because, in prisoner civil rights
cases, medical experts are necessary for the indigent plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of proof on
damages. Such is not the case here regarding Professor Oquendo’s expert opinion on Ecuadorian
law.

17. The Court Finds the Expert Witness Fees are Reasonable. Alternatively, the
Plaintiffs move for a reduction of the fees billed by Professor Oquendo and his assistant, Claudia
Schubert, because the hours billed for preparing the report are excessive and unreasonable. (D.I.
419 at 6-7) Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the court should evaluate the expert’s fees by the
same standard it applies to the fees charged by a Special Master. (Jd. at 7)

18. Fees billed by Special Masters bear no relationship to fees billed by a court
appointed expert because Special Masters are not subject to Rule 706. It remains within the
court’s discretion to allocate costs for a court appointed expert. Moreover, the role of a Special

Master is akin to that of a judicial officer not an expert witness. Plaintiffs’ argument ignores the
distinction and lacks any supporting authority.

19. Professor Oquendo and Schubert billed the parties $337,796 for approximately
432 hours of work during the months of October of 2021 through December of 2021, resulting in
completion of a 30-page report. (D.I. 419, Ex. A; D.I. 393) The court asked Professor Oquendo
to respond to Plaintiffs’ Motion challenging his expert witness fees. (D.I. 424) In his response,
Professor Oquendo explains that his report “delves deeper” than the report of Plaintiffs’ expert in
opining on the issues in the pending case. (D.I. 427 at 1) Professor Oquendo did not pull up the
cases on both sides of the issue and decide between them. Rather, “[iJn pursuit of reliability for
[the] assessment, [he and his assistant] stud[ied] the totality of [the issues] and develop[ed] an
analytic scheme.” (Jd. at 2) In fact, Professor Oquendo could find no direct authority on point
addressing the disputed issues for which he was retained. (D.I. 426, Ex. A at 133:21-134:17;
195:23-196:14 (discussing that the Constitutional Court has not spoken on whether a protection
action could be retroactively applied to conduct that occurred before the adoption of the
Ecuadorian Constitution)) Professor Oquendo states in his declaration that he worked on seven
prior cases researching similar issues of Ecuadorian law, and in six of them he expended more
hours than he did here. (D.I. 427 at 1)

20. Plaintiffs questioned Professor Oquendo about the charges on his bill ina
videoconference specifically for that purpose and, later, at his deposition. (/d. at 4-5; D.I. 426,
Ex. A at 211:11-24) In their Motion, Plaintiffs fail to mention their questioning of Professor
Oquendo on either occasion. Plaintiffs fail to substantively respond to Professor Oquendo’s
explanation in defense of his fees. Plaintiffs argue generally that the hours expended on the
expert report were unreasonable, but they provide no facts to support their position. Plaintiffs do

not suggest any analytic framework for auditing the reasonableness of the number of hours billed
nor have they provided a declaration attesting to the hours reasonably necessary to provide the
expert report ordered by the court. Plaintiffs simply provide a comparison of the hours billed by
Professor Oquendo’s team with the number of hours billed by the Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Maria
Mifio. (D.I. 419 at 6) Dr. Mifio billed a total of $7,500 for 25 hours of work to complete a 10-
page report. (/d.) A superficial comparison of Plaintiffs’ expert’s bill to the court appointed
expert’s bill is a thin basis on which to avoid payment of their allocated share which the court
appropriately ordered in the exercise of its discretion.

21. Plaintiffs complain that Professor Oquendo addressed more issues than were
necessary compared to the issues addressed by Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Mifio. (/d.) The argument
misses the point that Professor Oquendo was appointed by the court and his report conforms to
the scope of duties set by the court. Therefore, the court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to
demonstrate that the number of hours billed by Professor Oquendo and Schubert were
unreasonable, and therefore, denies Plaintiffs’ Motion to reduce Professor Oquendo’s bill for
expert witness fees.

22. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED. (D.L
419) An Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue. Upon the expiration of
the deadline for objections, if any, or upon further Order of the court, the amount of $168,898.00
shall be released by the court from the funds on deposit in full and final satisfaction of Plaintiffs’
share of Professor Oquendo’s fees.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

Presently before the court in this civil action for trademark infringement and related state
law claims is the motion for entry of default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
55(b)(2), filed by Plaintiff Eden Foods, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants Earl George (d/b/a
Eden Salt, Inc., Eden Salt LLC, Eden Salt and Eden Import and Exports), and Eden Import &
Export LLC (d/b/a Eden Salt Import and Export LLC and Eden Salt), and Serving With a
Mission (collectively, the “Defaulting Defendants”). (D.I. 30)! For the following reasons, I
recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiff's motion for entry of default judgment under Rule

55(b)(2) and issue a permanent injunction against the Defaulting Defendants.

! The briefing and other filings associated with the pending motion for default judgment are
found at D.I. 31, D.I. 32, D.L. 33, and D.I. 35.
I. BACKGROUND

Plaintiff began as a food co-operative in the mid to late 1960s, and after finding initial
success with its organic retail food store, it began branding its own organic food products under
the “Eden” trademark around 1969. (D.I. 33 at {] 4-5) Plaintiff has operated continuously since
then and continues to use its “Eden” trademark and brand name. (D.I. 33 at J 5)

For more than twenty years Plaintiff has sold “Eden” branded salt. (D.I. 33 at | 19)
Three of Plaintiff’s marks specifically relate to salts sold under the Eden® family of trademarks:
Registration Nos. 1,452,337 (“the 2337 mark”), 1,862,634 (“the ’634 mark”), and 3,071,337
(“the ’1337 mark”). (D.I. 15 at J 26-7, 33) Plaintiff first registered a mark relating to salt in
1987, with the 2337 mark registering “Eden” as a trademark for food and beverage products
including “sea salt for table use.” (D.I. 33 at § 20) Plaintiff registered the “Eden” trademark for
additional food and beverages, including “sea salt” in 1994 under the 634 mark. (D.L. 33 at J
20) Plaintiff also registered “Eden Foods” as a trademark for “salt” in 2006 with the 1337 mark.
(D.I. 33 at § 20) All of these trademarks have been duly renewed and remain in effect. (D.I. 33
at { 20)

On January 12, 2022, the Defaulting Defendants submitted an application to the United
States Patent & Trademark Office (""USPTO"") for the trademark “Eden Salt.” (D.I. 32-1 at 2)
Within this trademark application, the Defaulting Defendants indicated that “Eden Salt” had
been used in commerce since May 7, 2021. (/d.) The Defaulting Defendants’ trademark
application also stated the applicant has used the trademark “Eden Salt” in interstate commerce
at least as early as July 5, 2021. (D.I. 15 at | 64) This trademark application was signed by
“Earl George” and listed Eden Salt’s office address as 501 Silverside Rd., PBM#371,

Wilmington, Delaware 19809. (D.I. 32 at { 7)
Thereafter, Plaintiff sent two letters to Andrea Selkregg (“Selkregg”), the attorney who
filed the Eden Salt trademark application, asking her to provide details on the identity of her
client. (D.I. 32 at 10) A letter to Selkregg dated February 4, 2022, represented that the
Defaulting Defendants’ trademark application for Eden Salt likely infringed Plaintiff's family of
Eden Foods marks. (D.I. 15 at (66) Selkregg indicated she forwarded the information to her
client and stated that she did not represent Eden Salt in the trademark dispute with Eden Foods.
(DL. 32 at ¢ 11) On March 8, 2022, Plaintiff contacted Selkregg again to request contact
information for a principal or officer of Eden Salt. (D.I. 32 at ] 12) Selkregg indicated that she
had forwarded the information to her client but declined to provide any more information. (Jd.)

On March 14, 2022, Plaintiff contacted the number listed on the Defaulting Defendants’
website to obtain information about their directors and officers. (D.I. 32 at 13) The person
who answered the phone identified himself only as “President” of Eden Salt. (/d.) This
individual stated he was represented by counsel in the trademark dispute between Eden Salt and
Eden Foods, but he declined to identify his counsel. (/d.) Plaintiffs counsel was unable to
engage further given that the individual claimed to be represented by counsel. (/d.)

On March 30, 2022, Plaintiff commenced this action against the Defaulting Defendants
alleging that they used Plaintiff’s marks as part of their trademark application for “EDEN
SALT,” in their trade and domain names, and in the distribution and marketing of their salt
products at the wholesale and/or retail level. (D.I. 1 at Ff 40-44; D.I. 15 at J] 50-54) About a
week after the complaint was filed, the court entered an order permitting Plaintiff to serve
limited, expedited discovery to ascertain the identities of the Defaulting Defendants. (D.I. 9)

Plaintiff then filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on May 27, 2022, which names the
Defaulting Defendants and is otherwise substantively the same as the original complaint. (D.I.
15 at ff] 4-5)

The record before the court indicates Plaintiff served the FAC and summons on
defendant Serving With A Mission by way of its receiving agent on June 9, 2022. (D.I. 19) The
following day, Plaintiff served the FAC and summons on the authorized agent of Earl George
and Eden Import & Export LLC. (D.I. 17; D.I. 18) The Defaulting Defendants failed to file and
serve a timely responsive pleading as required under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.

Shortly before the Defaulting Defendants’ responsive pleading deadline expired, Plaintiff
represented on the record that it had faced significant hurdles in serving the Defaulting
Defendants, and it had not been able to personally serve Earl George or Eden Import & Export
LLC. (DL 20; D.I. 21) On August 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed two affidavits of service detailing its
additional attempts to personally serve Earl George and Eden Import & Export LLC at Earl
George’s Brooklyn apartment, ending with the process server posting the summons and FAC on
the door of the apartment on July 20, 2022, and mailing the summons and FAC to two Brooklyn
addresses the following day. (D.I. 24; D.I. 25)

On August 18, 2022, the court entered a default in appearance against the Defaulting
Defendants, finding that service was effectuated based on the executed summonses, the affidavits
of service, and the representations made in the declaration accompanying the request for entry of
default. (D.I. 28; D.I. 29) The court also allowed Plaintiff to issue subpoenas to any registrar for
the edensalt.com domain. (D.I. 28)

Plaintiff filed the pending motion for entry of default judgment pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2)

on September 12, 2022. (D.I. 30) The assigned District Judge referred the pending motion to
the undersigned judicial officer on October 21, 2022. (D.I. 34) On November 1, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a letter confirming that the USPTO refused to register “Eden Salt” due to a likelihood of
confusion with Plaintiff's marks. (D.I. 35)

II. LEGAL STANDARD

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) provides that a district court may enter default
judgment against a party when default has been entered by the Clerk of Court. Fed. R. Civ. P.
55(b). The decision to enter a default judgment is within the discretion of the court. Tristrata
Tech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Rsch., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010) (citing Hritz v.
Woma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180 (3d Cir. 1984)). The court’s determination is guided by three
considerations: “(1) prejudice to the plaintiff if default is denied, (2) whether the defendant
appears to have a litigable defense, and (3) whether defendant’s delay is due to culpable
conduct.” Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 2000). “A consequence of the
entry of a default judgment is that the factual allegations of the complaint, except those relating
to the amount of damages, will be taken as true.” Comdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142,
1149 (3d Cir. 1990); see J & J Sports Prod., Inc. v. Kim, C.A. No. 14-1170-LPS, 2016 WL
1238223, at *1 (D. Del. Mar. 29, 2016).

The court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the amount of damages or
establish the truth of the allegations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). However, “Rule 55 does not
require that testimony be presented as a prerequisite to the entry of a default judgment[.J]” 10A
C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2688 (3d ed. 2007); see Rhino Assocs.,
L.P. v. Berg Mfg. & Sales Corp., 531 F. Supp. 2d 652, 657 (M.D. Pa. 2007). Plaintiff seeks only
injunctive relief in this instance, and for the reasons set forth below, the uncontroverted factual

allegations in the FAC obviate the need for a hearing to substantiate Plaintiff's proposed
permanent injunction. See S.E.C. v. Krimm, C.A. No. 17-464-RDM, 2019 WL 2270437, at *5
(D. Del. May 28, 2019) (granting proposed injunctive relief without a hearing on a motion for
default judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)).
Il. DISCUSSION

A. Default Judgment

I recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default judgment against the
Defaulting Defendants. As described at § I, supra, Plaintiff served the FAC on the Defaulting
Defendants, who failed to answer or otherwise respond, and the Clerk of Court entered a default
in appearance against the Defaulting Defendants. Accordingly, the court takes as true the
unchallenged factual allegations in the FAC, which plausibly establish the Defaulting
Defendants’ use of Plaintiff's marks will cause a likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act.
See Comdyne I, 908 F.2d at 1149; A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237
F.3d 198, 202 (3d Cir. 2000) (explaining that trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114
and unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) are measured by identical standards).
The plausibility of Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims extends to the remaining claims brought under
Delaware state and common law. See Acxiom Corp. v. Axiom, Inc., 27 F. Supp. 2d 478, 506-07
(D. Del. 1998) (finding it unnecessary to determine whether Axiom’s actions infringed under the
Lanham Act and under Delaware state law or common law because the state law claims are
similar to their federal counterparts in both scope and remedy); see also Mil. Certified
Residential Specialist, LLC v. Fairway Indep. Mortg. Corp., 251 F. Supp. 3d 750 (D. Del. 2017);
see also S&P Glob. Inc. v. S&P Data LLC, C.A. No. 20-701-RGA, 2022 WL 3098096 at *17 n.2

(D. Del. Aug. 4, 2022).
Moreover, the factors articulated by the Third Circuit in Chamberlain weigh in favor of
default judgment against the Defaulting Defendants. See Chamberlain, 210 F.3d at 164. First,
Plaintiff has shown it will be prejudiced by its inability to enforce its marks if the motion is
denied because the Defaulting Defendants have been unresponsive to Plaintiff's efforts to
communicate and will likely continue to infringe Plaintiff's trademarks. (D.I. 15 at ff 64-68);
see Tristrata Tech., Inc. v. Med. Skin Therapy Rsch., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 161, 164 (D. Del. 2010)
(finding prejudice resulting from inability to enforce patent rights or recover damages). Denial
of default judgment will prejudice Plaintiff by precluding “any effective avenue for obtaining
relief[.]” Roy v. Sakhr Software Co. (K.S.C.C.), C.A. No. 11-863-LPS, 2015 WL 4608132, at *2
(D. Del. July 31, 2015).

The second Chamberlain factor also weighs in favor of default judgment. Whether the
Defaulting Defendants have a litigable defense is unclear due to their failure to appear and
participate in the litigation. See Tristrata, 270 F.R.D. at 164. The strength of Plaintiff's pleaded
allegations on the likelihood of confusion also reduces the odds that the Defaulting Defendants
could present a meritorious defense. Plaintiff's registered marks “EDEN” and “EDEN FOODS”
are facially similar to the Defaulting Defendants’ name “Eden Salt.” See Javo Beverage Co.,
Inc. v. Javy Coffee Co., C.A. No. 22-547-RGA, 2023 WL 387587, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 25, 2023)
(finding a likelihood of confusion to be plausible between “Javo” and “Javy”). This similarity is
further confirmed by the USPTO’s rejection of the Defaulting Defendants’ trademark application
for “Eden Salt” based on the likelihood of confusion with Plaintiffs marks. (D.I. 35 at 2-3) The
factual allegations in the FAC also establish Plaintiff's decades-long use of its marks in the food
market, (D.I. 15 at ff 25-27, 33); the Defaulting Defendants’ marketing of their products through

the same channels as Plaintiff, (id. at ¢ 70; see also D.I. 33 at § 26-27; D.I. 32 at ¢ 33); and the
Defaulting Defendants’ continued use of Plaintiff's marks despite actual knowledge of them.
(D.I. 15 at FJ 66, 69-71)

The third and final Chamberlain factor weighs in favor of default judgment because the
Defaulting Defendants have been on notice of this action, and their decision not to defend against
the allegations in the FAC amounts to willful and culpable conduct. See Krimm, 2019 WL
2270437, at *5. Plaintiff has reached out to the Defaulting Defendants on several occasions,
sending notice of their infringement, following up with the Defaulting Defendants’ trademark
attorney, and calling the “Eden Salt” number listed on the website. (D.I. 15 at {J 66-68)
Nonetheless, the Defaulting Defendants have responded with evasiveness. (/d.; D.I. 32 at 4 11-
13, 28-31) For these reasons, I recommend that the court grant Plaintiff's motion for default
judgment under Rule 55(b)(2).

B. Permanent Injunction

Plaintiff asks the court to permanently enjoin the Defaulting Defendants’ conduct. (D.I.
30 at 1) The court may award injunctive relief under the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1116.
Generally, a party prevailing on the merits must show four factors to obtain a permanent
injunction: (1) it will suffer irreparable injury; (2) no remedy available at law would be
sufficient; (3) the balance of hardships tips in its favor; and (4) the injunction would serve public
interests. TD Bank N.A. v. Hill, 928 F.3d 259, 278 (3d Cir. 2019). In the “specialized context”
of a default judgment, where the defendant does not respond and the plaintiff cannot quantify its
damages, these factors generally weigh in favor of injunctive relief. See Ottomanson, Inc. v.
UCAI, LLC, 2020 WL 205945, at *4 (D.N.J. Jan. 10, 2020) (“Merely enjoining infringement
does not deprive the defendant of anything to which it is entitled, and it is in the public interest to

do so.”).
Because liability for trademark infringement and unfair competition has been established
and Plaintiff has shown that future violations are likely, the court may issue a permanent
injunction. See Krimm, 2019 WL 2270437, at *6 (issuing permanent injunctive relief on a
motion for default judgment because defendants did not respond to the complaint or otherwise
represent that future violations were unlikely); see also Innovative Office Prods., Inc. v.
Amazon.com, Inc., 2012 WL 1466512, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 26, 2012) (issuing a permanent
injunction based on acceptance of infringement allegation as true for purposes of the motion for
default judgment). Consequently, I recommend that the court issue a permanent injunction
against the Defaulting Defendants consistent with the relief sought at paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of
Plaintiff's proposed order. (D.I. 30-1 at f{ 4-5, 7)

However, Plaintiff's proposed order seeks a broad spectrum of injunctive relief. I
recommend that the court deny the relief sought at paragraphs 6, 8, and 9 of Plaintiff's proposed
order because these requests for relief are not adequately supported by the record and the
applicable case authorities. (D.I. 30-1 at ff 6, 8-9)

I recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs requested relief at paragraph 6 of the
proposed order, which seeks a transfer by the Defaulting Defendants and/or the domain name
registrar of “any and all rights to any domain name(s) that any of the enjoined persons possesses
or controls, where the domain name contains the word ‘EDEN’ (including but not limited to
edensalt.com).” (D.I. 30-1 at ]6) Plaintiffs request is made pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §
1125(d)(1)(C), which authorizes the court to “order the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain
name or the transfer of the domain name to the owner of the mark.” But § 1125(d)(1)(C)
provides relief for violations of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (“ACPA”),

which specifically addresses trademark violations in the registration, trafficking, or use of a
domain name. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d); see Pa. Business Bank v. Biz Bank Corp., 330 F. Supp. 2d
511 (ED. Pa. 2004) (analyzing trademark infringement under § 1114 and cybersquatting under §
1125(d) as separate causes of action). Because Plaintiff's complaint does not allege a cause of
action under the ACPA, Plaintiff has failed to make the requisite showing of liability to support
the remedy of a domain name transfer under § 1125(d)(1)(C). Cf Ownum, LLC v. Ownum, Inc.,
C.A. No. 19-1043-MN-JLH, 2020 WL 8882941, at *1, 4 (D. Del. Apr. 17, 2020) (granting
transfer of a domain name to the plaintiff on a motion for default judgment where the case
“involve[d] an alleged violation of the [ACPA].”).

I recommend that the court deny Plaintiffs requested relief at paragraph 8 of the
proposed order, which seeks to enjoin the Defaulting Defendants “from filing any trademark
application seeking to register any trademark that incorporates ‘EDEN’ or any other word
confusingly similar thereto, and that Earl George and Eden Import & Export LLC must withdraw
any such pending applications.” (D.J. 30-1 at §8) The record shows that the Defaulting
Defendants already filed a trademark application which was denied due to a likelihood of
confusion with Plaintiff's mark. (D.I. 35) Plaintiff has failed to provide any authority
supporting this request, and the court finds no basis to grant the request.

Finally, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiff's requested relief at paragraph 9 of the
proposed order, which seeks to compel the Defaulting Defendants to “deliver up for destruction
or other disposition by Plaintiff, all EDEN SALT products as well as any advertisements,
brochures, labels, product packaging, signs, prints, decals, business cards, order forms, stickers,
tags, promotional materials, and other items in their possession, custody or control on which the
EDEN mark appears (alone or in combination with other terms)[.]” (D.I. 30-1 at ]9) Plaintiff

cites 15 U.S.C. § 1118 in support of this request, which provides that the decision whether to

10
enter a destruction order is left to the court's discretion. See 15 U.S.C. § 1118 (providing that
“the court may order that all labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles, and
advertisements” to be delivered up and destroyed); Daimler AG v. A-Z Wheels LLC, 498 F. Supp.
3d 1282 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (“Under 15 U.S.C. § 1118, the decision whether to enter a destruction
order is left to the court’s discretion.”). Having recommended a permanent injunction against
further infringement under the Lanham Act, I recommend that the court deny Plaintiff's request
for an order requiring the destruction of any infringing articles as unnecessary. See Kelley Blue
Book v. Car-Smarts, Inc., 802 F. Supp. 278, 293 (C.D. Cal. 1992) (“[W]here an injunction is
issued under the Lanham Act enjoining an infringer from further infringement, the rights of the
plaintiff are adequately protected and an order requiring destruction of infringing articles, though
permitted, may be unnecessary.”).
IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the court GRANT Plaintiff's motion for
entry of default judgment under Rule 55(b)(2), enter judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 58, and issue a permanent injunction in the following form:

IT IS ORDERED that the Defaulting Defendants shall cease and desist
from any and all infringement of Plaintiff's rights in its registered marks which
are identified in the motion for default judgment.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the Defaulting Defendants is

enjoined from any use of “EDEN” (alone or in combination with other terms,

including but not limited to “EDEN SALT”) or any words confusingly similar

thereto, as a trademark, trade name, corporate name, domain name, social media

presence, or other commercial indication of origin, or that incorporates EDEN in

11
connection with the advertising, display, sale, offering for sale or distribution of

any products in any medium, whether through wholesale, retail or online channels

(including but not limited to sales on the Internet, through Amazon, through any

Amazon storefront or via any other online presence).

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the Defaulting Defendants is

enjoined from operating the edensalt.com website.

Plaintiff shall serve a copy of this Report and Recommendation on the Defaulting
Defendants and shall file proof of such service with the court once service is complete.

This Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R.
Civ. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1. The parties may serve and file specific written objections
within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). The objections and responses to the objections are limited to three (3)
pages each. The failure of a party to object to legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right
to de novo review in the District Court. See Sincavage y. Barnhart, 171 F. App’x 924, 925 n.1
(3d Cir. 2006); Henderson v. Carlson, 812 F.2d 874, 878-79 (3d Cir. 1987).

The parties are directed to the court’s Standing Order For Objections Filed Under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 72, dated March 7, 2022, a copy of which is available on the court’s website,
