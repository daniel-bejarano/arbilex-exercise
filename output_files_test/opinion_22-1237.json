Mar. 28, 2023), affirming same (\"Affirmance Order\"), and the occurrence of the Plan's \nEffective Date, pending final disposition of Certain Insurers' appeal to the Third Circuit. The D& V \nClaimants (D.I. 154) and Lujan Claimants (D.I. 156) have filed their own Emergency Motions \nseeking a stay pending appeal. There is currently a temporary stay in place that will expire on April \n11, 2023 (\"Temporary Stay\"). Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8025 (\"Unless the district court or BAP orders \notherwise , its judgment is stayed for 14 days after entry.\") Absent a stay, Certain Insurers argue \nthat the Temporary Stay will \"expire after Tuesday, April 11\" (D.I. 174 at 5), and the Plan will go \neffective, at which point Certain Insurers risk the chance that BSA will argue that the Plan has been substantially consummated and that any appeals are equitably moot, \"raising a substantial risk of \nirreparable harm.\" (D.I. 152 at 1). \nOn April 6, 2023, BSA and other appellees filed their Joint Opposition to these Emergenc y \nMotions (D.I. 164), together with the declaration of Brian Whittman (\"Whittman Deel.\") and the \ndeclarations of certain survivors and their representati ves in support (D.I. 165-173). BSA argues, \namong other things, \"Appellants raise the same issues that two courts have already determined are \nmeritless in lengthy, detailed opinions applying established law to largely uncontroverted facts.\" \n(D.I. 164 at 3). BSA further argues that if a stay pending appeal is granted, the Plan may never be \nconsummated , and BSA may be forced to liquidate. (Id. at 15; Whittman Deel. ,r,r 11-12). \"The \nimposition of any stay will (i) substantiall y harm the BSA' s operations , including , the ability to \nrecruit new members and secure donations , and jeopardize the BSA's ability to continue as a \nnational organization and (ii) cost tens of thousands of survivors and other stakeholders , many of \nwhom are elderly, billions of dollars.\" (Id. at 15; Whittman Deel. at ,r,r 5-20). \"Further, if the BSA \nis forced to liquidate, the Insurance Settlement Agreements would terminate , and it may prove \nimpossible for survivors to ever collect the $1.65 billion those agreements contemplate .\" (Id. at 15; \nD.I. 1-3 at 140; Whittman Deel. ,r 18). Finally, BSA argues that the Emergency Motions, filed by \n\"Certain non-settling insurance companies and two claimant groups comprised of less than 0.2% of \nsurvivors ,\" fail to demonstrate the irreparable harm required for the extraordinary relief of a stay. \nThe Emergency Motions were fully briefed on April 7, 2023. (D.I. 174-176). On April 10, \n2023, Lujan Claimants (D.I. 177), D&V Claimants (D.I. 179), and the various insurance companies \nthat make up the Certain Insurers filed their appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 1 \n1 Notices of appeal were filed by Liberty Insurance Underwriters , et al. (D.I. 178), Columbia \nCasualty Co., et al. (D.I. 180); Landmark Insurance Company , et al. (D.I. 181); Indian Harbor \nInsurance Company (D.I. 182); Old Republic General Insurance Group (D.I. 183); Travelers \nCasualty and Surety Company, Inc. (D.I. 184); Great American Assurance Company, et al. (D.I. \n185); Allianz Global Risks US Insurance Company , et al. (D.I. 186); Argonaut Insurance Company , \n2 Certain Insurers indicated that they were going to file on April 10 \"an expedited stay relief request \n... in the Third Circuit.\" (D.I. 174 at 5). \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Emergenc y Motions are denied. The request for a \ntemporary stay while I decide the motions before me is dismissed as moot. The request that I grant \na stay to April 27, 2023, for the benefit of the Court of Appeals, is denied. I note that the Court of \nAppeals has the authority to grant any appropriate orders, including an \"order appropriate to \npreserve the status quo.\" Fed. Bankr. R. P. 8025(d)(4). The appeals and emergenc y motions are \nnow before the Court of Appeals. I do not think it is my place to suggest how much time the Court \nneeds to consider requests directed to it for emergenc y relief. \n1. Background. Following a lengthy, contentious , and emotionall y charged \nproceeding , the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan supported by every estate fiduciary and the \noverwhelming majority of abuse survivors. This Court's affirmation of the Confirmation Order was \na condition precedent to the Effective Date of the Plan. (See D.I. 1-4, Art. IX.B. la). Absent a stay, \nthese conditions precedent may now be satisfied. \n2. The Plan embodies a global resolution of scouting-related sexual abuse claims. The \ncornerstone of the Plan is a series of settlements , resolving a complex array of overlapping \nliabilities and insurance rights, which will establish a compensation fund for abuse survivors-the \nSettlement Trust. The settlements provide at least $2.46 billion in cash and property to the \nSettlement Trust benefiting abuse survivors , plus significant unliquidated assets, including valuable \ninsurance rights worth up to another $4 billion plus. The Plan channels to the Settlement Trust all \nabuse claims against BSA, related non-Debtor entities, and those covered by insurance policies \nissued by certain Settling Insurance Companies . It also provides for coextensi ve nonconsensual \net al. (D.I. 187); Gemini Insurance Company (D.I. 188); General Star Indemnity Company (D.I. \n189); and Arrowood Indemnity Company (D.I. 190); and Endurance American Insurance Company \n(D.I. 191). \n3 releases of the channeled abuse claims. The channeled abuse claims will be processed , liquidated , \nand paid by a Settlement Trustee in accordance with the Settlement Trust Agreement and Trust \nDistribution Procedures (\"TDP\"). (D.I. 1-4, Ex. A). The TDP were the subject of intensive \nnegotiations by BSA and various constituencies during the chapter 11 cases. The Bankruptcy Court \nfound that the channeling injunction and releases are the \"cornerstone of the Plan,\" and are \nnecessary to ensure an equitable process by which abuse survivors ' claims will be administered and \npaid. In re Boy Scouts of Am., 642 B.R. at 610. Based on BSA's expert's estimate of the aggregate \nvalue of abuse claims, the Bankruptcy Court found that BSA had shown, by a preponderance of the \nevidence , that the holders of abuse claims will be paid in full. Id. at 560. \n3. The Plan provides that BSA may declare that the Effective Date of the Plan has \noccurred so long as, among other things, the Affirmance Order has been entered, no court has \nentered a stay of the Effective Date pending an appeal, and there is no request for a stay of the \nEffective Date , although this condition can be waived. (See Plan, Art. IX.B). Upon the Effective \nDate, the Settlement Trust Assets-including cash consideration from various appellees and the \nassignment of rights under various insurance policies (\"Insurance Assignment \"}-will \nautomatically be transferred to the Settlement Trust, and certain claims will be paid. \n4. Jurisdiction. Appeals from the Bankruptcy Court to this Court are governed by 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 158. District courts have mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals \"from final judgments , \norders, and decrees.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(l). The Plan Confirmation Order is a final order. \n5. Discussion. The granting of a motion for stay pending appeal is discretionary . See \nIn re Trans World Airlines, Inc., 2001 WL 1820325 , at *2-3 (Bankr. D. Del. Mar. 27, 2001). The \nmovant bears the burden of proving that a stay of the Confirmation Order is warranted based on the \nfollowing criteria: (1) whether the movant has made \"a strong showing\" that it is likely to succeed \non the merits; (2) whether the movant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether a stay \n4 will substantially injure other interested parties; and (4) where the public interest lies . Republic of \nPhil. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 949 F.2d 653,658 (3d Cir. 1991). \n6. The most critical factors, according to the Supreme Court, are the first two: whether \nthe stay movant has demonstrated (1) a strong showing of the likelihood of success, and (2) that it \nwill suffer irreparable harm -the latter referring to harm that cannot be prevented or fully rectified \nby a successful appeal. In re Revel AC, Inc., 802 F.3d 558, 568 (3d Cir. 2015) (citing Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418,434 (2009) (internal citations omitted)) . The Court's analysis should proceed \nas follows: \nDid the applicant make a sufficient showing that (a) it can win on the merits (significantl y \nbetter than negligible but not greater than 50%) and (b) will suffer irreparable harm absent \na stay? If it has, we balance the relative harms considering all four factors using a 'sliding \nscale' approach. However , if the movant does not make the requisite showings on either of \nthese first two factors, the inquiry into the balance of harms and the public interest is \nunnecessary, and the stay should be denied without further analysis. \nRevel AC, 802 F.3d at 571 (emphasis in text) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n7. Likelihood of success on the merits. Certain Insurers have failed to make a \"better \nthan negligible \" showing that they are likely to prevail on the merits of their appeal. First, Certain \nInsurers argue that they are likely to succeed on their argument that the Plan's assignment of \ninsurance rights to the Settlement Trust was impermissible as a matter of law and must be reversed. \nThe Plan requires \"the assignment and transfer to the Settlement Trust\" of all \"rights, claims, \nbenefits, or Causes of Action of the Debtors, Related Non-Debtor Entities, Local Councils, or \nContributing Chartered Organizations under or with respect to the Abuse Insurance Policies (but not \nthe policies themselves). \" (Plan Art. 1.A.157). The Plan does not assign the entire insurance \n\"policies,\" Certain Insurers complained on appeal. (D.I. 45 at 25). ''Nor does it purport to assign \nany of BSA's contractual obligations to its insurers or say anything at all about whether BSA or \nanyone else remains obligated to comply with those contractual duties\" (Id.). \n5 8. I agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that rights under the insurance policies may be \nassigned consistent with applicable state law. \"Under the Bankruptcy Code, if a contract is not \nexecutory, a debtor may assign, delegate, or transfer rights and/or obligations under section 363 of \nthe Bankruptcy Code, provided that the criteria of that section are satisfied. \" In re Boy Scouts of \nAm., 642 B.R. at 668 (quoting In re Am. Home Mortg., 402 B.R. 87, 92-93 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009) \n(emphasis in original)) . The Insurance Policies are not executory contracts , id. at 668 n. 729, and \nno insurer argued otherwise. \"Assuming \u00a7 363 is the operative section, ... Debtors can transfer \ntheir property rights consistent with applicable state law.\" Id. The Bankruptcy Court found that\u00a7 \n363 was satisfied: \"The Plan's transfer of rights under BSA Insurance Policies (the \"Debtor Policy \nAssignment \") is authorized and permissible notwithstanding any terms of any policies or provisions \nof applicable law that are argued to prohibit the assignment or transfer of such rights.\" (D .I. 1-1 1 \nII.I.2). \n9. Certain Insurers have identified no authority that stands for the proposition that \ninterests under their policies could not be assigned. The Bankruptcy Court cited cases noting that \ndebtors routinely assign their insurance policy interests to a settlement trust. See, e.g., In re \nCombustion Eng'g, 391 F.3d 190,218 n.27 (3d Cir. 2004) (\"The Bankruptcy Code expressly \ncontemplates the inclusion of debtor insurance policies in the bankruptcy estate.\"); In re Kaiser \nAluminum Corp., 343 B.R. 88, 95 (D. Del. 2006); In re Fed.-Mogul , Inc., 385 B.R. 560, 567 (Bankr. \nD. Del. 2008) (\"[Section] 1123(a)(5)(B) expressly contemplates that the debtor's interests in the \npolicies may be assigned to a trust or other entity.\"); see also In re Congoleum Corp., 2008 WL \n4186899, at *2 (Bankr. D.N.J. Sept. 2, 2008) (\"[A] plan ofreorganization may assign insurance \npolicies to a personal injury trust.\"). Certain Insurers fail to distinguish these cases. \n10. Certain Insurers merely rehash their arguments that Courts do not have the power to \nrewrite contracts to allow debtors to continue to perform on more favorable terms, and that the Plan \n6 fails to \"preserve and affirmatively recognize insurer rights, including the rights to investigate legal \nliability, to defend claims, to require the insured to cooperate with its insurers in the defense of \nclaims, and to consent to any settlements. \" According to Certain Insurers, this Court invited \nconfusion by \"agree(ing] that the plan could not re-write insurance policies\" but also \"failing to \nspecifically find that the \"cum onere principle \" applies to the Insurance Assignment. \" (D.I. 152 at \n4). Certain Insurers are unlikely to succeed on this argument. I found that the Plan does not rewrite \nthe insurance policies or allow BSA to perform on more favorable terms. (D.I. 150 at 76). Rather, \nthe Plan's clear language preserves all of the Insurers' rights and defenses under their policies, as \nconfirmed by trial testimony and the Bankruptcy Court 's rulings. (Id. at 74-75). The TDP is \nexplicit in not modifying the insurance policies and preserving the policy obligations as they existed \nprepetition: \nNothing in these TDP shall modify, amend or supplement , or be interpreted as \nmodifying , amending , or supplementing the terms of any Insurance Policy or rights \nand obligations under an Insurance Policy assigned to the Settlement Trust to the \nextent such rights and obligations are otherwise available under applicable law and \nsubject to the Plan and Confirmation Order. The rights and obligations , if any, of the \nNon-Settling Insurance Companies relating to these TDP, or any provision hereof, \nshall be determined pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Insurance Policies \nand applicable law. \n(D.I. 1-4, Ex. A, Art. V.C). The Plan again references preserving those obligations in the \nassignment provision: \nThe Settlement Trust's rights under any insurance policies issued by the Non\u00ad\nSettling Insurance Companies, including the effect of any failure to satisfy \nconditions precedent or obligations under such policies (other than, in case of the \nBSA Insurance Policies, the terms of any policies or provision of applicable law that \nare argued to prohibit the assignment or transfer of such rights), shall be determined \nunder the law applicable to each policy in subsequent litigation . \n(D.I. 1-11 II.I.2(e)). Certain Insurers do not cite any language in the Plan or the TDP abrogating \nthe BSA's obligations under the insurance policies. \n7 11. Certain Insurers' argument that the Plan does not explicitly identify their alleged \nrights to defend claims or to cooperate in the defense is irrelevant because there is no obligation that \na plan do so. Certain Insurers never had a right to prevent BSA from settling claims or using a trust \nor otherwise , or a right to require BSA to cooperate with them. The Certain Insurers' rights are to \nraise coverage defenses for any alleged failure to comply with the terms of their policies. In re Boy \nScouts of Am., 2023 WL 2662992, at *36 (the bargain \"is for the Certain Insurers to pay covered \nclaims ... there was never a bargain to allow[] the Certain Insurers to prevent the BSA from \ncompensating survivors of childhood abuse or otherwise resolving claims\"). \n12. Certain Insurers rehash their challenge to the Bankruptc y Court's conclusion that the \nPlan was proposed in good faith, arguing that this Court failed to apply the correct standard under In \nre LTL Management , 58 F.4th 738, 753 (3d Cir. 2023). (D.I. 152 at 5). But this Court's opinion \nboth quoted and applied the In re LTL standard. In re Boy Scouts of Am., 2023 WL 2662992, at \n*59-60; see also id. at *75. The Bankruptc y Court's findings of fact, which the Certain Insurers \nstate they are not challenging , all support the legal conclusion of good faith: (i) the Plan was \ndesigned to achieve the objectives and purposes of the Bankruptc y Code to reorganize and to \nprovide compensation to survivors , (ii) the BSA did not collude with survivors , (iii) the TDP is not \ndesigned to inflate awards, but rather is designed to result in awards consistent with prepetition \npractices, (iv) the BSA protected the rights of the Certain Insurers, (v) the Plan resulted from \nthousands of hours of mediated negotiations among more than a dozen stakeholder groups, and (vi) \nthe Plan enjoyed overwhelming support from every major stakeholder in the case. Certain Insurers' \nlack of good faith argument is unsupported by any evidence. \n13. Certain Insurers argue they are likely to succeed on appeal because this Court's \n\"analysis did not give appropriate consideration to critical, undisputed facts adduced at trial, such as \nthe fact that BSA proposed to make the preservation of insurers' contractual rights subject not only \n8 to applicable law, but also to the provisions of the plan and confirmation order (an attempt to \n1 abrogate insurers' rights and bind them in coverage litigation without insurer input).\" (D.I. 152 at \n6). This merely rehashes their prior argument, which fails because the Plan expressly preserves \ntheir rights and defenses. Certain Insurers' general arguments that the Plan is inconsistent with \nother \"overarching principles \" or that the objectives and purposes of the Code were not \"fairly \nachieved,\" does not demonstrate a strong showing of likelihood of success on appeal where no \nspecific evidence has been proffered in support. Certain Insurers cite In re Global Industrial \nTechnologies, 645 F.3d 201, 213-15 (3d Cir. 2011) in support of their argument that the Third \nCircuit can reverse plan confirmation on good faith grounds. (See D.I. 152 at 6-7). However , as \npreviously noted, that case addressed \"standing to object to a plan,\" whereas here, \"[i]nsurers were \nfull participants at trial, but they introduced no evidence of collusion or that any claims were \nfraudulent-the opposite of what happened in Global Industrial. \" In re Boy Scouts of Am., 2023 \nWL 2662992, at *73. I think Appellants ' good faith arguments are frivolous. \n14. D& V and Lujan Claimants have failed to demonstrate likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their many arguments. First, D& V and Lujan Claimants argue they are likely to prevail on \ntheir appeals related to the Plan's channeling injunction and releases based on a lack of (i) \njurisdiction, (ii) statutory authority outside of \u00a7 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) ability to \nmeet the Third Circuit's hallmarks of permissible nonconsensual releases. (See D.I. 156 at 3-6; see \nalso D.I. 154 at 5-10). But the Bankruptcy Court's confirmation of the Plan's channeling \ninjunction and releases comports with Third Circuit law. \n15. D&V and Lujan Claimants argue they are likely to succeed on the jurisdiction issue \nbecause a finding of \"shared insurance was not enough to give the Bankruptcy Court 'related to' \njurisdiction over abuse claimants' independent third-party claims against [] nondebtor third parties.\" \n(D.I. 154 at 6-7). But the Bankruptcy Court's exercise of 'related to' jurisdiction \" was based not on \n9 that finding alone, but on many specific findings including \"identity of interest, shared insurance , \ncontractual indemnity , and residual property interests, each of which is supported by careful \nfindings.\" In re Boy Scouts of Am., 2023 WL 2662992 at *26 (summarizing same). Indeed, the \nrecord supports findings that BSA is the \"real party defendant\" in the abuse actions, and the \ninterconnected nature of the delivery of scouting within the tripartite structure further supports the \nidentity of interest between debtors arid non-debtor third parties. Id. at *21 (\"BSA was the 'real \nparty defendant ' in defending Abuse Claims.\"); see also id. at *22 (\"There can therefore be no \nconcern that there is only an 'incidental ' relationship connecting the Channeling Injunction and \nReleases to BSA\"). The record also contains \"ample evidence of complex and competing claims \nagainst BSA's insurance which supports subject matter jurisdiction over claims against the \nReleasees.\" Id. at *24. There is also automatic indemnification of all abuse claims based on the \nannual charter agreements and board resolutions. Id. Additionally , the BSA's residual interest in \nLocal Council property supports \"related to\" jurisdiction. Id. at *25. \n16. D&V and Lujan Claimants are not likely to succeed on the statutory authority \nargument either, because the Third Circuit, courts within the Third Circuit, and other courts have \nrepeatedly recognized the statutory authority of bankruptcy courts to issue nonconsensual third\u00ad\nparty releases under appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., In re Cont'! Airlines, 203 F.3d 203, 214-\n15 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that a third-party injunction would be proper under \u00a7 105( a) if the \nproponents of the injunction demonstrated with specificity that such an injunction was both \nnecessary to the reorganization and fair); In re Glob. Indus., 645 F.3d at 206 (explaining that a \nthird-party injunction under\u00a7 105(a) requires showing with specificity that an injunction is both \nnecessary to the reorganization and fair) (citing In re Cont'! Airlines, 203 F.3d at 214). \n17. The Third Circuit has recently held that a bankruptcy court is constitutionally \nauthorized to confirm a plan containing nonconsensual third-party releases if it concludes that the releases are integral to the debtor-creditor relationship . In re Millennium Lab Holdings, II, LLC, \n945 F.3d 126, 135 (3d Cir. 2019). As the Bankruptc y Court explained , this ruling \"suggests an \nimplicit recognition that the granting of third-party releases is still permissible as part of the \nconfirmation process.\" In re Boy Scouts of Am., 62 B.R. at 594. \"The granting of such releases, \ntherefore , must be found in the bankruptc y court's ability, in appropriate circumstances , to exercise \nits inherent equitable power consistent with\u00a7\u00a7 105(a), 1123(a)(5), and 1123(b)(6) of the \nBankruptcy Code.\" Id. \n18. D&V and Lujan Claimants point to no error in this reasoning and cite no binding \ncases to the contrary. D&V and Lujan Claimants argue that the Plan's channeling injunction and \nreleases are expressly prohibited under\u00a7\u00a7 524(e) and 524(g) but cite no authority supporting their \ninterpretation or showing they are likely to succeed on this argument. Indeed, the Third Circuit has \nrejected the argument that\u00a7 524(e) bars non-consensual third-party releases. See In re PWS \nHolding, 228 F.3d 224,247 (3d Cir. 2000) (determining that Continental \"did not treat\u00a7 524(e) as a \nper se rule barring any provision in a reorganization plan limiting the liability of third parties,\" but \nrather \"concluded ... the releases at issue were impermissible because the hallmarks of permissible \nnon-consensual releases ... [were] absent\"). And \u00a7 524(g), which expressly authorizes third-party \nreleases in asbestos cases, does not render such releases impermissible in non-asbestos cases. \nRather, as the Bankruptcy Court observed , Congress enacted a rule of construction in \u00a7 524(g) that \ncontradicts the inference that Lujan Claimants and D&V Claimants ask this Court to make. In re \nBoy Scouts of Am., 642 B.R. at 595. \n19. D&V and Lujan Claimants argue that they are likely to succeed in arguing that the \nPlan's injunction and releases, even if permissible , did not meet the Continental hallmarks of \npermissible non-consensual third-party releases. These Appellants point to no error in the \nBankruptcy Court's specific findings supporting the fairness and necessity of the Plan's injunction \n11 and releases, however, including that the releases are narrowly tailored to address only claims \nrelated to abuse in scouting. Indeed, the Confirmation Opinion \"includes countless specific findings \nof fact that support each aspect of the necessity and fairness\" under Continental , including that the \nthird-party releases are necessary and essential to the settlements embodied in the Plan and without \nthe releases, the BSA's reorganization fails. In re Boy Scouts of Am., 2023 WL 2662992, at *33. \n20. D&V and Lujan Claimants rehash their argument that the Bankruptcy Court erred in \nfinding that abuse claims will likely be paid in full under the plan and dispute the credibility the \nexpert testimony BSA proffered in support. (See D.I. 154 at 9-10; D.I. 156 at 6). D&V and Lujan \nClaimants are not likely to succeed in challenging this factual finding as they offered no evidence to \ncontradict the expert's opinion. The Bankruptc y Court's reliance on BSA's expert's uncontroverted \nand well-reasoned expert opinion is not likely to be overturned on appeal based on the \nunsubstantiated statements by non-experts that Appellants cited throughout the appeal. \n21. Lujan Claimants separately argue that the McCarran-Ferguson Act reverse preempts \nthe Bankruptcy Code. (See D.I. 156 at 6-7). I rejected this argument, agreeing with the Bankruptc y \nCourt that the Guam statute only provides a procedural right to bring claims against insurers, but \"is \nnot for the protection of policyholders\" and does not regulate the business of insurance. In re Boy \nScouts of Am., 2023 WL 2662992, at *42. I further distinguished each decision relied upon by \nLujan Claimants , including for their failure to address the \"business of insurance \" exception of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act. See id. at *43-45. Lujan Claimants ' Emergency Motion does not point to \nany error in my reading of those cases or application of the statute. I nevertheless recognize that my \ndecision on this issue is not free from doubt, and I think Lujan Claimants have a better than \nnegligible chance of being right on this issue. \n22. Lujan Claimants argue that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their argument \nthat the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to authorize the sale of insurance policies free and \n12 clear \"over Lujan Claimants ' interests\" and \"over the [Archbishop of Agafia's] interests in BSA \ninsurance policies and non-debtors ' separate insurance policies in which Debtors lack any interest.\" \n(D.I. 156 at 7). I agreed with the Bankruptc y Court that the Insurance Settlements do \"not \ndisadvantage the Lujan Claimants more than other creditors,\" and Lujan Claimants have cited no \nauthority that requires a different outcome. In re Boy Scouts of Am., 2023 WL 2662992, at *39. \nLujan Claimants further point to no error in my conclusion that they lacked standing \"to raise the \nrights of the Archbishop ,\" as the Archbishop settled with the BSA and further stipulated to resolve \nits objection to the Plan. Id. Again, this conclusion is consistent with law in the Ninth Circuit law, \nwhich has jurisdiction over the District Court of Guam where the Archbishop 's bankruptc y was \nfiled, and which has held that \"a creditor has no independent standing to appeal an adverse decision \nregarding a violation of the automatic stay.\" In re Pecan Groves of Ariz., 951 F.2d 242, 245 (9th \nCir. 1991) (rejecting argument that the purpose of the automatic stay is to protect both the debtor \nand creditors) . The Ninth Circuit has further held that creditors do not have an independent right to \nenforce alleged stay violations. See In re Barrett, 833 F. App'x 668, 670 (9th Cir. 2020) (\"[I]f the \ntrustee does not seek to enforce the protections of the automatic stay, then no other party may \nchallenge acts purportedly in violation of the automatic stay, because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 is intended \nsolely to benefit the debtor estate\"). Lujan Claimants have cited no authority to the contrary. \n23. Lujan Claimants have further failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of \ntheir argument that the Bankruptc y Court abused its discretion in approving the insurance \nsettlements under Bankruptcy Rule 9019 based on the Martin factors: \"(1) the probability of \nsuccess in litigation ; (2) the likely difficulties in collection ; (3) the complexity of the litigation \ninvolved, and the expense, inconvenience and delay necessarily attending it; and (4) the paramount \ninterest of the creditors. Myers v. Martin (In re Martin), 91 F.3d 389, 393 (3d Cir. 1996). The \nBankruptcy Court's determination was based on an extensive evidentiary record and included \n13 specific findings as to each Settling Insurance Company , including the amount of its contribution , \nexisting or potential coverage litigation issues, and the complexity and risk associated with \nlitigating those issues. Based on the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the Insurance \nSettlements \"resolv[ e] complex insurance coverage issues, saving years of litigation and expense \nand yielding more timely recoveries for holders of Direct Abuse Claims.\" In re Boy Scouts of Am., \n642 B.R at 564. Lujan Claimants point to no clear error and have demonstrated no basis to find \nthat the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in approving the insurance settlements. \n24. Irreparable harm absent a stay. Appellants have failed to demonstrate irreparable \nharm absent a stay pending appeal. To do so, a movant must demonstrate an injury that is neither \nremote nor speculative , but actual and imminent. \" Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 571; In re WR. Grace, \n475 B.R. 34,206 (D. Del. 2012). The movant must establish a resulting injury \"that cannot be \nredressed by a legal or equitable remedy.\" Instant Air Freight Co. v. CF. Air Freight, Inc., 882 \nF.2d 797, 801 (3d Cir. 1989). Finally, a purely economic injury generally does not meet the burden. \nSee Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 572 (\"[A purely economic injury, compensable in money, cannot satisfy \nthe irreparable injury requirement\" unless \"the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the \nexistence of the movant's business.\") \n25. Appellants argue that absent a stay they are likely to suffer \"irreparable\" harm \nbecause of the substantial risk that the Plan will be promptly consummated and their appeals will be \ndismissed as equitably moot. The possibility that an appeal may become moot does not alone \nconstitute irreparable harm for purposes of obtaining a stay. In re Tribune Co., 477 B.R. 465,477, \nn.12 (Bankr. D. Del. 2012) (\"[t]he possibility of equitable mootness , while a factor here for \nirreparable harm, is not dispositive of the ultimate question of whether to grant a stay pending \nappeal.\") If the possibility of mootness alone were sufficient to show irreparable injury, \"a stay \n14 would be issued in every case ofthis nature pending appeal.\" In re WR. Grace, 475 B.R. at 207. \nAppellants must show something more. \n26. Certain Insurers themselves characterize the additional harms they face as \nspeculative. They argue that, absent a stay and reversal of the Plan Confirmation Order, they may \nnot receive the benefit of their bargain with respect to their rights under the policies. (D.I. 152 at 11 \n(\"Certain Insurers would be independentl y harmed absent a stay because they would be subject to \nrisks that run counter to the economic bargain in their contracts .\") Such a hypothetical falls far \nshort of posing an injury that is \"actual and imminent. \" Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 571. As there was \nno requirement that the Plan prejudge all possible litigation possibilities and outcomes under all \npolicies, Certain Insurers cannot be harmed by its failure to do so. Moreover , Certain Insurers' \ndefenses are preserved , the usual enforcement actions exist, and so, unlike \"irreparable harm,\" any \nharms that Certain Insurers may face can \"be redressed by a legal or equitable remedy.\" Instant Air \nFreight, 882 F.2d at 801. \n27. Notably, Certain Insurers \"do not concede that equitable mootness is doctrinall y \ncorrect\" or that it necessarily \"would apply here,\" but \"to the extent that the Third Circuit continues \nto recognize the equitable mootness doctrine,\" Certain Insurers assert that \"strong arguments exist \nthat [the Third Circuit] would, among other things, still retain the ability to fashion relief with \nrespect to the Plan.\" (D.I. 152 at 10). The doctrine of equitable mootness remains recognized by \nthe Third Circuit. See, e.g., In re Nuverra Environm ental Solutions Inc., 834 Fed. App'x 729 (3d \nCir. 2021). That said, I agree that, upon a successful appeal, it is conceivable that relief might be \nfashioned-such as requiring the transfer of the entire policies-that would not unravel the entire \nPlan. In sum, Certain Insurers have failed to establish irreparable harm warranting a stay pending \nappeal. \n15 28. D&V and Lujan Claimants assert they will suffer irreparable harm because their \nclaims against non-debtors will be released under the Plan. (D.I. 156 ,r 11; D.I. 154 ,r 17). These \narguments fail because they are premised on the erroneous notion, unsupported by evidence, that \nthey will receive more compensation for their claims outside of the Plan. To the contrary, the \nBankruptcy Court made a finding of fact, supported by the only record evidence on the matter, and \naffirmed by this Court, that survivor claims will likely be paid in full under the Plan. That D& V \nand Lujan Claimants may give up more than other claimants fares no better-such a harm is \"purely \neconomic ,\" may be redressed by a legal or equitable remedy, and is likely illusory, as their claims \nwill be paid in full and there is no \"additional \" payment to which they are entitled. \n29. Having evaluated Appellants ' likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable \nharm absent a stay, and having determined that Appellants have failed to carry their burden as to \neither element, the Court is satisfied no further analysis is required. See Revel AC, 802 F.3d at 571.2 \n30. Conclusion. The Bankruptcy Court's ruling is consistent with existing precedent , \nand Appellants have failed to establish that they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a \nstay. \nNOW, THEREFORE , it is HEREBY ORDERED that the Emergency Motions (D.I. 152, \n154, 156) are DENIED . The request for a temporary stay while I decide the motions before me is \nDISMISSED as moot. The request that I grant a temporary stay to April 27, 2023, is DENIED. \nEntered this 11th day of April, 2023. \n2 I do note BSA's out-of-pocket expenses of about $3,400,000 per month related to being in \nbankruptcy. (D.I. 165, Whittman Deel., at 6-7). I also note the other 99.8% of abuse claimants \nwhose claims remain in limbo as long as the Plan does not go effective. When evaluating the \nmotions for stay ofD&V Claimants and Lujan Claimants , who are likely to be made financially \nwhole by the Settlement Trust, any injury to them seems to be outweighed by the injury to others. \n16 "}
