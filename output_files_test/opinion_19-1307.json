I have considered the parties' briefing on each motion (D.I. 199, 213, 221; D.I. \n203, 211, 220). I held oral argument on March 14, 2023. (D.I. 229). After oral argument , at my \nrequest, the parties submitted the complete reports for the two experts, Ms. Davis and Mr. \nSchoettelkotte. 1 \nFor the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs ' motion is GRANTED , and Defendant 's motion \nis GRANTED.2 \n1 The submissions were not docketed. Portions of the reports are in the record, though. (D.I. \n214-1, Ex. I, at 222-262 of 370 (Schoettlekotte Opening); D.I. 204-1, Ex.Cat 45-54 of 89 (Davis \nRebuttal); D.I. 214-1, Ex.

BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs NNCrystal US Corporation and the Board of Trustees of the University of \nArkansas (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") assert U.S. Patent No. 7,105,051 (the \"'051 Patent\") against \nDefendant Nanosys, Inc. The '051 Patent covers methods for synthesizing nanocrystals . (D.I. 199 \nat 3). \nDefendant manufactures thirteen different types of quantum dots that are accused of \ninfringing the '051 Patent. (D.I. 199 at 4; D.I. 211 at 8; D.I. 213 at 28). Quantum dots are comprised \nof a \"core\" that is surrounded by a \"shell.\" (D.I. 199 at 4; D.I. 213 at 28). For all but two of the \naccused products, just the shells are accused of being produced by Plaintiffs ' claimed method. \n(D.I. 199 at 4; D.I. 213 at 28). \nII. LEGAL ST AND ARD \nstates: Federal Rule of Evidence 702 sets out the requirements for expert witness testimony and \nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, \nexperience, training, or education may testify in the form of an \nopinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other \nspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the \nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based \non sufficient facts or data; ( c) the testimony is the product of reliable \nprinciples and methods; and ( d) the expert has reliably applied the \nprinciples and methods to the facts of the case. \nFed. R. Evid. 702.3 The Third Circuit has explained: \n[T]he district court acts as a gatekeeper , preventing oplillon \ntestimony that does not meet the requirements of qualification , \nreliability and fit from reaching the jury. See Daubert (\"Faced with \na proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must \ndetermine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a) [of the Federal \nRules of Evidence] whether the expert is proposing to testify to ( 1) \n3 The Rule is on schedule to be amended in December 2023. \nPage 2 of 11 scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand \nor determine a fact in issue.\"). \nSchneider ex rel.

DISCUSSION \nA. Defendant's Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony \nDefendant moves to exclude the opinion of Plaintiffs damages expert, Mr. W. Todd. \nSchoettelkotte, on two grounds. First, Defendant argues that Mr. Schoettelkotte failed to apportion \nhis reasonable royalty calculation. (D.I. 199 at 18, 20-23; D.I. 221 at 10-15). Second, Defendant \nargues that Mr. Schoettelkotte erroneously included non-infringing activities in his royalty base \nfor estimating reasonable royalty damages. (D .I. 199 at 18-19). \n1. Failure to Apportion \nMr. Schoettelkotte determined that a reasonable royalty would be a rate of 5% applied to \nDefendant's sales of all the accused products. (D.I. 199 at 20; D.I. 213 at 36). \nFor most of the accused products, only the shells are alleged to be manufactured using an \ninfringing process, not the cores. (D.I. 199 at 4; D.I. 213 at 28). Defendant argues that Mr. \nSchoettelkotte's testimony should be excluded because his proposed reasonable royalty does not \napportion value to the non-infringing cores (D.I. 199 at 5). To the extent Mr. Schoettelkotte 's \nopinions rely on analyzing comparable licenses, Defendant contends that Mr. Schoettelkotte has \n4 The Court of Appeals wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent \namendments to it were not intended to make any substantive change. \nPage 3 of 11 not demonstrated how those licensing agreements contain \"built-in apportionment \" or how those \nlicenses are sufficientl y comparable such that further apportionment is not required. (D.I. 221 at \n11-15). \nPlaintiffs counter that Mr. Schoettelkotte properly apportioned because he \"relied on \ncomparable licenses that contained 'built-in apportionment ,' including licenses to the '051 patent \nand accounted for the value of any non-infringing features as part of his analysis.\" (D.I. 213 at 34). \nPlaintiffs cite to Pavo Sols. LLC v. Kingston Tech. Co., Inc., for the proposition that using a \n\"sufficiently comparable license\" to determine the royalty can obviate the need for further \napportionment because the license may have \"built-in apportionment. \" 35 F.4th 1367, 1380 (Fed. \nCir. 2022). Plaintiffs further contend that Mr. Schoettelkotte 's testimony should not be excluded \nbecause he conducted a Georgia-Pacifi c analysis using comparable licenses, which can be used to \napportion the royalty rate. (D.I. 213 at 36 (citing Exmark Mfg. Co. Inc. v. Briggs & Stratton Power \nProd. Grp., LLC, 879 F.3d 1332, 1348-49 (Fed. Cir. 2018))). \n\"[T]he ultimate reasonable royalty award must be based on the incremental value that the \npatented invention adds to the end product.\" Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, \n1226 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The Federal Circuit has instructed that district courts, as gatekeepers , should \n\"ensure that only theories comporting with settled principles of apportionment [are] allowed to \nreach the jury.\" VirnetX, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., 767 F.3d 1308, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2014). \nI find Mr. Schoettelkotte 's testimony should be excluded. Mr. Schoettelkotte asserts that \nthe comparable licenses he analyzed had \"built-in apportionment \" (D.I. 214-1, Ex. I, p. 49, 1122 \n(256 of 370)), but he does not explain how he arrived at that conclusion or cite to provisions of the \nlicenses for support. \"Built-in apportionment effectively assumes that the negotiators of a \ncomparable license settled on a royalty rate and royalty base combination embodying the value of \nPage 4 of 11 the asserted patent.\" Vectura Ltd. v. Glaxosmithkline LLC, 981 F.3d 1030, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 2020). \nMr. Schoettelkotte has not demonstrated how that assumption applies here. \nEven if the licenses had built-in apportionment , Mr. Schoettelkotte has not explained how \nthe licenses he analyzed are \"sufficiently comparable \" such that further apportionment would not \nbe necessary. See Omega Pats., LLC v. Ca/Amp Corp., 13 F.4th 1361, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The \nlicenses Mr. Schoettelkotte relies on included a broader portfolio of intellectual property or \ntechnology rights, than would be present in a hypothetical negotiation here. (D.I. 221 at 11 (citing \nD.I. 200, Ex. 18 at NNC-00000024-28)). Neither Mr. Schoettelkotte nor Plaintiffs provide support \nfor the assertion the royalty rates in these licenses specifically embody the value of the '051 Patent \n(or similar technology) and its contributions to manufacturing components (i.e., the shells) of \nquantum dots, as opposed to the value of the '051 Patent with other patents and technology. See, \ne.g., Omega Pats., 13 F.4th at 1380 (noting licenses that cover additional patents can be used to \nprovide a rate without additional apportionment if the \"distinguishing facts\" are accounted for); \nLaserDynamics , Inc. v. Quanta Computer , Inc., 694 F.3d 51, 79 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (\"When relying \non licenses to prove a reasonable royalty, alleging a loose or vague comparability between different \ntechnologies or licenses does not suffice.\"); Bio-Rad Lab'ys, Inc. v. J0XGenomics , Inc., 2018 WL \n4691047, at *8 n.3 (D. Del. Sept. 28, 2018) (noting that \"analysis is required to determine whether \n[a] rate is apportioned in a comparable fashion to the contribution of the patented technology to \nthe accused products\"). \nPlaintiffs note that the presence of other patents in a license does not necessarily mean it is \nnot comparable . (D.I. 229 at 78:4-17). That is true. In such cases, however, there is evidence or \ntestimony to show the licenses are comparable despite the presence of the other patents. See, e.g., \nVectura, 981 F.3d at 1041 (finding a license covering additional patents comparable because the \nPage 5 of 11 expert demonstrated apportionment was \"baked in\" and the \"key component \" of the license was \n\"very similar technologies \" to the patented technology); RSB Spine, LLC v. DePuy Synthes Sales, \nInc., 2022 WL 17084156, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 18, 2022) (finding a license covering additional \npatents was comparable because the expert explained why the additional patents did not impact \nhis calculation). Mr. Schoettelkotte has not provided such an explanation here nor has he examined \nthe value of the '051 Patent relative to the other patents in the license agreements. \nI disagree with Plaintiffs that Mr. Schoettelkotte's Georgia-Pacific analysis can salvage \nhis lack of apportionment analysis. Mr. Schoettelkotte recognizes that the licenses he analyzed \nincluded additional patent and technology rights, which \"would have a downward impact on the \nstated royalty rates.\" (D.I. 214-1, Ex. I at 22-23, 25-26, 30; see id. at 49). I do not think that is \nsufficient to apportion value to the '051 Patent as a part of a portfolio or for its contributions to the \naccused products. As Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument , Mr. Schoettelkotte does not state that \nthe '051 Patent is the primary source of value of the patent portfolios in those other licenses. (D.I. \n229 at 79:6-24). \nQuantitative apportionment is not necessarily required, as for example when there is \"built \nin apportionment ,\" Bio Rad, 967 F.3d at 1376, but, given that Mr. Schoettelkotte does not provide \nan apportionment analysis and the licenses cover a broader set of rights than what would be present \nin a hypothetical negotiation between the parties here, I think Mr. Schoettelkotte needs to provide \nmore than just an up or down arrow. For example, in RSB Spine, LLC v. DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc., \nI admitted damages testimony that did not contain a separate apportionment analysis because (1) \nthe testimony relied on comparable licenses and (2) the expert addressed why the presence of \nadditional licensed patents in those licenses did not impact his calculation of a reasonable royalty. \n2022 WL 17084156 , at *2. \nPage 6 of 11 For the reasons explained, Mr. Schoettelkotte has not justified his conclusion that the \nlicenses he analyzed had built-in apportionment. Even if those licenses had built-in apportionment, \nMr. Schoettelkotte has not explained how those licenses are sufficiently comparable such that \nfurther apportionment is not necessary. Therefore, I find that his testimony is improper for failure \nto account for apportionment and should be excluded. \n2. International Sales in the Royalty Base \nDefendant argues that Mr. Schoettelkotte improperly included non-infringing activities -\nsales of the product, which is manufactured outside of the United States, to customers outside of \nthe United States -in his royalty base. (D.I. 199 at 18-19). At oral argument, I ruled that these \nsales are not protected by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g) and should be excluded from the royalty base. (D.I. \n229 at 107:7-14). \nB. Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony \nMs. Davis calculated a reasonable royalty for each accused product by using a \n\"combination product\" formula. (D.I. 204-1, Ex. C at 52 of 89 (Davis Rebuttal)) . A simplified \nexample illustrates the formula approach. An accused product is a quantum dot -comprised of a \ncore and shell -where only the shell is made by a method that infringes. The total cost of \nmanufacturing the accused product would be the cost of the shell (S) and the cost of the core (C). \nTo calculate a reasonable royalty, the royalty base would be the total sales of the accused product \n(Y). In order to apportion the sales attributable to infringement, the royalty base would be reduced \nby the relative cost to produce the product (S/(S+C)). The apportioned royalty base would be \nS/(S+C) times Y, or (YS)/(S+C) . Ms. Davis applied \"a royalty rate of no more than 2%\" to the \napportioned royalty base. (D.I. 204-1, Ex. C at 54 of 89 (Davis Rebuttal)). \nPage 7 of 11 Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Davis' method for calculating a reasonable royalty \"does not \nreflect the value of the patented process or the products produced with the patented process\" \nbecause her royalty base is based on the relative cost of the infringing component, not its relative \ncommercial value. (D.I. 203 at 5). Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Davis has not supported her \nconclusion that the relative cost of a component is a reliable proxy for the component's commercial \nvalue as she relies on a conversation with Nanosys's COO, Mr. Devenney, and statements made \nfrom Nanosys's Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Russell Kempt. (Id at 6). Mr. \nDevenney stated that Ms. Davis' method was reasonable , but Plaintiffs argue Mr. Devenney is not \nqualified to offer that conclusion because he is not an economics expert. (D.I. 220 at 3). Mr. Kempt \nstated that the costs of the products is factored into the pricing. (Id at 3-4). Plaintiffs point out that \nMr. Kempt also indicated that the value of the products were factored into pricing as well, \nindicating that cost-based apportionment is incomplete. (Id). \nDefendant argues that Ms. Davis' testimony should not be excluded because her method is \nproperly applied in this case. Defendant contends that cost-based apportionment has been approved \nby the Federal Circuit. (D.I. 211 at 3 (citing Summit 6, LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd, 802 F.3d \n1283, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2015))). Defendant maintains that Ms. Davis' method is supported because \ncomparable licensing agreements use a similar formula for combination products to account for \nthe relative value of patented features to unpatented features. (D.I. 211 at 4-5). Even though those \nprovisions use component net sales or gross sales as inputs, rather than costs, Defendant contends \nthat cost can be used as a proxy for sales in this case because the sales prices of the products are \nbased on margins added to the cost of materials to produce the quantum dots. (Id at 6). \nAs an initial matter, I do not read Summit 6 to mean that cost-based apportionment can be \nused in every case or even in many cases. The Federal Circuit stated that the analysis done by the \nPage 8 of 11 expert in that case \"was sufficiently tied to the facts of the case.\" Summit 6, 802 F.3d at 1298. The \naccused product there was a phone with a camera. The asserted patent related a specific method \nthat involved the camera component . The expert in Summit 6 relied on \"annual reports, internal \ncosts and revenue spreadsheets , and interrogatory responses to determine \" the fraction of product \ncost that was attributed to the infringing component-the camera--and the fraction of Samsung 's \nrevenue from selling the accused phone that could be attributed to the camera. Id. at 1297-98. \nWhatever sense the cost-based apportionment made in the context of a phone with a camera, it \ndoes not make sense in the much less complex core and shell scenario. \nI find that Ms. Davis' testimony should be excluded. I agree with Ms. Davis that using the \ncombination product formula could be reasonable in theory, especially when a similar formula was \nincluded in comparable licenses. (D.I. 211 at 5). Ms. Davis, however, deviates from the \ncombination product formula because she uses component costs, not component sales, as inputs. \nMs. Davis has not demonstrated that the cost of a component is a reliable proxy for the \ncomponent's value to the overall product. To the contrary, I think there is reason to find cost-based \napportionment to be unreliable in this case. \nFirst, Mr. Devenney is not an economics expert, so his opinion that a method sounds \nreasonable does not carry any weight. Even though Mr. Devenney may be aware of the pricing of \nthe products, there is no reason to believe that he is qualified to state whether cost-based \napportionment is applicable to this case. \nSecond, Mr. Kempt states that the value of the products is factored into pricing the \nproducts. This statement would indicate that Ms. Davis' method is missing a key component to \nestimating the relative value of the different components in the accused products. \nPage 9 of 11 Third, Ms. Davis does not explain how the facts of this case -e.g., the roles of shells and \ncores in quantum dots or the role of the patented method in making the components -indicate that \nthe relative cost of materials for a component is representative of that component's relative \ncontribution to the value of the finished product. \nFor example, for the Gen 2.8 Red product, Ms. Davis calculated an apportionment factor \nof 20.82%. Despite using the method to create the shells of the Gen 2.8 Red product, like ten of \nthe other products, the apportionment factor is almost one half the value of the next closest \napportionment factor.5 (D.I. 211 at 9). Defendant argues the lower apportionment factor stems \nfrom the fact that the Gen 2.8 Red products were developed from \"'a simpler and more cost \neffective process' by eliminating 'problematic starting materials.\"' (Id. ( citing D .I. 212-6, Ex. 6) ). \nDefendant , however, misses the point. That the cost of manufacturing the shell decreases does not \nnecessarily mean that the commercial value of the shell, relative to the entire quantum dot, \ndecreases . For example, one can imagine that the fact a process can be performed at lower cost \nmay make it more valuable, not less. Ms. Davis' cost-based apportionment method assumes the \nopposite without justification. \nTo be clear, I am not stating that cost-based apportionment cannot be used in this case. Nor \nam I stating that the commercial value of the '051 Patent should be necessaril y greater for the Gen \n2.8 Red product in light of Nanosys' more cost-effective improvements . If cost-based \napportionment is to be used, however, Ms. Davis must demonstrate how the method is sufficiently \ntied to the facts of this case. Because I find that she has not, her testimony is excluded. \n5 The Gen 1 Red and Gen 2 Red products, which have apportionment factors of 39.01 %, are the \nclosest to Gen 2.8 Red's apportionment factor. (D.I. 211 at 8). All other products have greater \napportionment factors. (Id.). \nPage 10 of 11 IT IS SO ORDERED. \n~ \nEntered this f1_ day of April, 2023 \nUnited States \nPage 11 of 11 "}
